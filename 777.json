In his business he works with 50% in advance, he buys the materials cash down and this is why he has in his inventory dyes, stamps, adhesive paper, bond paper, plastic wrap and a little bit of everything to meet his customers\u2019 demands. Jos\u00e9 uses the computer to make the designs and hires out the printing, bookbinding or cutting which is why he needs to have some cash on hand when he needs to hire another service. This is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to have some cash and to buy materials like stamps, paper adhesives, bond paper, etc. Jos\u00e9 also needs the money for his other business which is selling natural products.

When the pig had grown, she sold it and could buy several new pigs. She has a young daughter who attends the local school. Delia has to struggle on her own, because her husband died. Her wish is to be successful in her business for the sake of her daughter. She dreams about expanding her business and buy more pigs.

He is married and has four children.  He has been involved in growing agricultural crops and animal husbandry for about five years.  These two types of businesses are related because leftovers from grown crops can be used to fatten up livestock and sell it at higher prices.  Fazliddin grows crops, such as barley and wheat.  He wants to obtain a loan in the sum of 5000 somoni to increase livestock headcount and buy seeds.  He wants to buy several heads of cattle and small livestock.  Fazliddin wants to use the resulting profit from the business to make improvements to his house.

She has been working in this business for seven years.  She started out selling used clothing but now she only sells new clothing.\n\nAlejandra comments that she has a large number of customers who are mainly new.  She makes her sales door to door and also over the Internet.  She buys her merchandise on the Internet and they post it to her.  She will use her loan to buy ladies' clothing. One of her business goals is to have sales premises and to go into business with one of her friends.\n\nAlejandra lives together with her husband and her three children who are 8, 3 and 1 year old.  Her dream is to own her own home and so she is saving up and has already applied for housing subsidy.  Her motivation to continue in her business is that she wants to help her family financially so that she can provide them with a better quality of life.\n\nAlejandra is very happy and grateful for the opportunity she has received from Fondo Esperanza as it will allow her to invest in her business.  She says that the members of her community bank are very responsible and nice people.  The training sessions have helped her to organize her business accounts.

This means she does not have the necessary income to pay for university studies. Moreover, her parents\u2019 economic situation is not stable, so she wants to contribute to the family income so they can improve this.\r\nIt is for these reasons that Ana Carolina started her own catalogue sales business. She sells clothes and cosmetics, among other products, and thanks to this, she has been able to generate income for her family and she can now aspire to get into university. \r\nAna Carolina offers very good quality products in her catalogues, which she combines with excellent customer service.

However, because she is only getting started, she does not have the necessary capital to buy what she needs.

Maria opened a small store selling basic goods.  She sold meat that she bought from small local cattle ranches until she found that her current business of selling clothing and electrical items generated more income than the previous work.\r\nShe buys some of the products that she sells in local markets but she purchases most of them in other cities at better prices.  The day that she purchases the merchandise she rises at 5 am and it takes her the whole day.  Then she goes to sell in other areas as well as her own community.\r\nMaria is requesting a loan from the Campo Foundation to buy more merchandise.  She tells us that now is when her sales of shirts for school uniforms go up and she takes advantage of this period to not only buy regular clothing, but also to buy the school uniforms, etc.\r\nThis is a good opportunity for her since this season is when she can increase her income.
