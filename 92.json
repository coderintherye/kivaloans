Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cAmanccay\u201d, is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea-level, in the community of A\u00f1ancusi in the district of Acoria, province of Huancavelica. The name \"Amanccay\" comes from a local flower. The main activities of the population are the growth of corn, potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes), and at lower altitudes of the Mantaro River tropical fruits. Most of the population also have cows, bulls and sheep, and at the higher altitudes llamas and alpacas. In the small town the population have some shops and proviD. several services, but the main commercial activity is on Tuesday, when there is the local market, where most people do business. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan-cycle with currently 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,200 soles (about 1,550 US$). The loans range from 200, 400, and up to 500 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save, except for the initial loan to start. But all agree to save in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Isabel Ignacia D. L. C. T.. Isabel has a small \u201ccafetin\u201d business where she sells  sweets, sandwiches and soft drinks at the local school. Besides her \u201ccafetin\u201d she sells fruits at local markets. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more things for her business.  Sometimes she kills one of the sheep to sell the meat. Like most people she has a small plot of land where the family cultivates a variety of products and has a small stock of cattle. With FINCA Per\u00fa she hopes to have her own savings to be able to buy a house in a bigger town, to work more enthusiastically and with more responsibility and to receive trainings. And her dream\u2026.. for her son to be a professional!\r\n<p>\r\nAnother story tells Epifania M. Y., who has her own grocery store. With her 500 soles loan she will buy more groceries to fill up her store again. And like Isabel, she also has a small plot where the family cultivates a variety of products and has a small stock of cattle, but mostly for their own consumption. Her dream for the future is to buy a house in Huancayo, one of the major cities in the central Andes, and for her children to be professionals. With her savings she will able to increase business, buying more merchandise and selling more. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more, to receive trainings and to be respected as a woman."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":152765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy new supplies for business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-04-28T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina Elda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-14T02:25:48Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4200,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-14T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238061,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":266935,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296038,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":326599,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":359842,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":260.01,"local_amount":693.35,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":703.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314309,"comment":null},{"amount":-0.01,"local_amount":0,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T03:09:30Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-21T03:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10242550,"comment":"Correction due to overpayment for business 45769"}],"funded_date":"2008-04-30T02:25:48Z","paid_date":"2009-01-21T03:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":45770,"name":"Estela","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Estela C.

N. lives in the Khuroson region. She is 35 years old, is married and has 6 children. She sells milk. She has a small farm with a calf, several lambs and a milk cow. She takes the milk to the local market and sells it to those that do not have animals of their own. She also collects milk from the local population and sells it on the market together with the milk from her own cow. However, in order to increase profit, Saodat decided to obtain a loan and purchase a second cow, which will provide her with additional milk. This will allow her to decrease prices, and will make the milk more affordable. She plans to repay the loan within a 12 months period. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430

D. is a widow. Her husband passed away three years ago and she was left alone with 2 children. In order to provide for her family she decided to go into sales. Despite all the hardships Gulchehra remained optimistic. She has been working in sales for the past 3 years, but she does not have enough funds to be able to increase turnover. She would like to obtain a $1000 loan that will help her to do that. The loan will increase the amount of profit she receives from the business and help supply the local population with goods. She plans to repay the loan within a 12 months period. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\u0414\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430

Y. lives in the Vakhsh area. He is 56 years old and has a university degree in economics. He lives with his wife and child.  He has a small and close family. Abdulhay buys and re-sells calves. He keeps the calves for some time to fatten up and then re-sells them. The profits from this business support his family. Abdulhay would like to expand the business to sell more calves. Expanding his business will also result in more good quality meat being available at the local market. In order to expand he needs financial help and so has requested a loan.  Abdulhay plans to repay the loan in 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p\r\n\r\n\r\n\u042e\u0441\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432

and her husband, Pedro, started their business, a restaurant, 4 years ago.  They had always had the idea of starting their own business, and after saving for quite some time they decided to open a restaurant as they thought this would be a good opportunity as there was a grill from a public transport office near their house.  Although the business belongs to them both, the money they make goes to Elvira as it is her who is in charge of the restaurant's administration and outgoings.  Her husband, on the other hand, works for a transport company, and has 2 buses that he rents to work on.\r\n<p> \r\nThanks to both of their efforts, in a short amount of time they got a juicer in their restaurant.  Their plan is to keep expanding and progressing so that they can give their kids, who are 17 and 9, a good education.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/> <p>\r\n\r\nElvira y Pedro, su esposo, hace cuatro a\u00f1os iniciaron una empresa juntos: un restaurante.

She is a 58-year-old woman and mother.  Thanks to her efforts, the location of her grocery store is being modified and expanded because the space that she had before is very small when compared with how much her business has grown in the last few years.  She started by selling drinks that she made herself, then she participated in sales campaigns on different dates of the year (Christmas, Mother's Day, the start of the school year, etc.).  <p>\r\nIt was when she built her house that it occured to her to build an additional room with the idea of starting a business.  As such, once her house was constructed, she decided to open her grocery store.  Little by little, she has implemented it, and now, she not only sells groceries, but also office supplies.<p>\r\nMar\u00eda's main motivation in these months is the education of her youngest daughter, who is 18-years-old, and who wants to enroll in a graphic design school. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nA pesar de que ya lleva veinte a\u00f1os trabajando en su bodega, Mar\u00eda contin\u00faa con las mismas fuerzas, e incluso m\u00e1s, que con las que empez\u00f3.

Gracias a su esfuerzo, el local de su bodega est\u00e1 siendo modificado y ampliado pues el espacio que ten\u00eda antes ya le quedaba muy chico para lo mucho que ha crecido su negocio en estos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Al inicio ella empez\u00f3 vendiendo bebidas hechas por ella misma, luego participaba de campa\u00f1as de venta en diversas fechas del a\u00f1o (navidad, d\u00eda de la madre, \u00e9poca escolar, etc).\r\nFue cuando construy\u00f3 su casa que se le ocurri\u00f3 construir una habitaci\u00f3n adicional con la idea de poner un negocio. Por lo tanto, una vez que estuvo construida su casa, decidi\u00f3 abrir su bodega. Poco a poco la ha ido implementando y, hoy, no solo vende productos de bodega sino tambi\u00e9n art\u00edculos de oficina.\r\nLa principal motivaci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda en estos meses es la

Isabel, it all started when she was very Young.  She was selling candies in the Central Market in Lima for a while until she decided to become independent.  She decided to open up a candy store alone, becoming an unofficial distributor of many candy companies.  When she had enough money saved up, she opened up a small store in her home, 18 years ago.  Bit by bit, thanks to her and her husband\u2019s efforts, she has been able to sign an agreement with a big candy company so that she is an exclusive distributor of their brand of candy and snacks.  Now she has been working for them for 15 years and the business keeps growing.\r\n<p>\r\nIsabel and her husbad have 2 kids who are 19 and 12 years old.  They both work hard to keep progressing and find new markets in which to sell their products.  The shop that they have is a sign of the great effort that they have put in since they decided to start this business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/.> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nPara Isabel todo empez\u00f3 cuando aun era muy joven. Estuvo vendiendo dulces al por mayor en el mercado central de Lima durante una temporada hasta que decidi\u00f3 independizarse. Sola se animo a ofrecer de bodega en bodega golosinas, cumpliendo el papel de distribuidora no oficial de las empresas de golosinas. Una vez que tuvo ahorrado un dinero abri\u00f3 una tienda de dulces en su casa hace dieciocho. Poco a poco y gracias a su esfuerzo y al de su esposo, ha podido conseguir un acuerdo con una empresa de golosinas para ser los distribuidores exclusivos de una marca de dulces y snacks. Hoy ya tienen quince a\u00f1os trabajando como distribuidores y contin\u00faan creciendo.\r\nIsabel y su esposo son padres de dos hijos que tienen diecinueve y doce a\u00f1os de edad. Ambos trabajan arduamente para seguir progresando y para cada vez encontrar mas mercados donde distribuir sus productos.
