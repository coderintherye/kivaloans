For about two years she has lived with her husband and beloved son in the home that she owns. She is a hard working lady who spends the whole day servicing the restrooms in the market that is located near her home. Her income from this activity helped her set up a small business selling personal care supplies such as shampoo, soap, and feminine hygiene products, which which she has increased the family income. She begins her workday very early in the morning, because she must clean the restrooms and make them ready for the users. She works from 6AM to 6PM every day, because she must make sure that the services are always in good shape.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rossana would like to open an office supply store, which has been a long-time dream of her and her husband, hoping that the day won't be far for this dream to be realized.

The money requested will be used to buy the largest supply of products to improve her sales and continue to save so that her dream of owning a large and prosperous business will come true.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Monica Hayden, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":279409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Incremento de su mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-27T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":379.47},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":385.68},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":406.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":422.52},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":443.57},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":462.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.95},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":117.64,"local_amount":379.47,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":385.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117177,"comment":null},{"amount":119.56,"local_amount":385.68,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":391.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012088,"comment":null},{"amount":125.95,"local_amount":406.28,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":412.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595673,"comment":null},{"amount":130.98,"local_amount":422.52,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":428.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989935,"comment":null},{"amount":137.51,"local_amount":443.57,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":450.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211067,"comment":null},{"amount":143.36,"local_amount":462.48,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":469.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640567,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-27T22:44:41Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92150,"name":"Phan Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Phan Th\u1ecb C\u01a1 n\u0103m nay 56 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb tham gia Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 2008.

She always liked clothes, particularly those that her daughter would ship to her from overseas, but in time she realized that the fabrics were of very good quality and would attract the attention of many, so she began to sell some of her dresses among her circle of friends. That is how her clothing sales business got started seven years ago. She now works with her two daughters who ship to her a variety of clothing articles that Mrs. Rosa sells to her many clients. This business has become very lucrative due to the novelty of the designs and the convenient prices of the garments, making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to setup a stand where she can better serve her clients and also show the clothes that she sells. This is her tenth loan; Rosa has been working in coordination with her group peers, because they are known to be very organized within MFP.

She always finds the strength to overcome the obstacles she faces.  Proof of this is the position she got 5 years ago, selling CDs and music videos of all kinds.  Thanks to her fondness for music, she is able to meet her customers\u2019 expectations.  The customers come to the market every day to buy a few CDs or DVDs from Ms. Rosa, who always greets them with a big smile.  For Rosa, her job is the only way she finds motivation, since she is surrounded by people who care for her and make her day happier.  Also, since there is a large demand for music in her region, her sales are good enough to cover the cost of the merchandise she buys at a wholesale price in downtown Lima.  In the future Rosa would like to open new booths in the market to create additional income for her expenses and savings.  Her priority is to support herself as she ages.  This is her 15th loan with MFP, where she has had the opportunity to grow along with her fellow members of the community bank.  With this loan money she will buy  new-release CDs and DVDs, which is important since things change quickly in the music and film industries.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":279414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs & Tapes","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase DVDs and CDs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-27T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":455.97},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":463.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":488.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":507.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":551.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140.59},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.52},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.34},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140.59,"local_amount":455.97,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":460.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117179,"comment":null},{"amount":142.89,"local_amount":463.44,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":467.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012090,"comment":null},{"amount":150.52,"local_amount":488.18,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":492.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595675,"comment":null},{"amount":156.55,"local_amount":507.72,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":512.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989937,"comment":null},{"amount":164.34,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":538.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211069,"comment":null},{"amount":170.11,"local_amount":551.69,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":557.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640569,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-27T20:32:00Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92155,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma tiene 39 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y su hijo en la casa que lograron construir a base de mucho esfuerzo.

Norma tiene un a\u00f1o trabajando con MFP, y desde que ingres\u00f3 tuvo el apoyo para mejorar su negocio y relacionarse con las personas con quienes viene trabajando tan amenamente en su banco comunal. El dinero que solicita esta vez es para la compra de \u00fatiles escolares y aprovechar la campa\u00f1a, ya que las clases se inician en marzo. ","en":"Norma is 39 and lives with her husband and son in the home that they were able to build with great effort.  She is a very active woman\u2014depending on the season she sells various products that satisfy her customers\u2019 demands.  She knows that holidays and fashion trends are key when investing in merchandise, which is why she does not only sell one specific thing.  Every week she sells her merchandise in nearby cities.  She has high operational costs but those are covered by the profit she makes from selling her products at a good price.  Norma would like to open a small general store in her home so she can stop traveling from place to place selling her products.  Although she likes visiting new places and other states in her country, it is very difficult to transport her products to these new places.  Norma has been working with MFP for one year and has found the needed support to improve her business and get to know the other people who work with this community bank.  The loan money will be used to buy school supplies to sell to students\u2014she wants to take advantage of the fact that classes begin in March.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":279415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"School supplies for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-27T17:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117180,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012091,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595676,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989938,"comment":null},{"amount":54.29,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211070,"comment":null},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":175.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640570,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-27T18:18:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92156,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb M\u1ea1nh n\u0103m nay 48 tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 3 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con  \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh.

From a young age she worked in sales, working in several jobs that taught her to be a good businesswoman.  When she married 5 years ago, she started a business with her husband, who helps her sell fruit and fruit juice.  They both leave the house at 6:00 am on their tricycle, which serves as their means of transportation.  They travel around the city selling fruit in the busiest places in the city, like hospitals, high schools and markets.  Maria, her husband and their children travel around together the whole day, which is very tiresome due to the heat.  However, this family is beyond grateful to have the opportunity to work and they know that in time they will be able to open a small store to sell their juices and fruits from.  Maria has been working with MFP for one year and this is her second loan, which will help her buy fruit.  She will buy crates of fruit in the downtown market since the prices are more affordable there.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":279417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"buy fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-27T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":95.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117181,"comment":null},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":95.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012092,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":95.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595677,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":95.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989939,"comment":null},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":95.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211071,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":97.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640571,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-27T20:01:40Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92158,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther G. is in the business of selling fish and beans at the market and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

She is a businesswoman\u2014when her mother died 10 years ago, Maria took over the store she left behind.  She had to quickly learn the rhythm of the market and how to increase her capital.  Increasing her capital gave her the opportunity to complete more orders and hire 2 people to help her.  She sells chicken and also delivers it to several nearby restaurants.  Even though every day the work is the same, her job gives her energy.  However, it is tiresome to make deliveries that are far away;  because of this, her next goal is to purchase a car.  This will make her job easier and also help her increase her profit and stop paying for transportation every day.  This is Maria\u2019s 10th loan with MFP in the past 6 years.  She is very grateful and she found not only other members within her community bank, but actual friends, which is the most important thing.  She will invest 1,000 soles in wholesale chickens to fill the orders that she has.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":279420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-27T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150.46},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":155.7},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":161.65},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":178.15},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":184.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48.9},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.6},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.9},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.9,"local_amount":150.46,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":160.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117182,"comment":null},{"amount":50.6,"local_amount":155.7,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":165.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012093,"comment":null},{"amount":52.54,"local_amount":161.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":172.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595678,"comment":null},{"amount":54.98,"local_amount":169.17,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":180.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989940,"comment":null},{"amount":57.9,"local_amount":178.15,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":189.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211072,"comment":null},{"amount":60.08,"local_amount":184.87,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":196.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640572,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-27T18:50:46Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92160,"name":"Pham Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb Hu\u1ebf  n\u0103m nay 31  tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 2 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con  trong \u0111\u00f3 c\u00f3 1 con \u0111ang tu\u1ed5i \u0111\u1ebfn tr\u01b0\u1eddng.

She has five grown children who all have steady employment.  In 2002, she became a member of the TYM Fund and used a loan to invest in raising animals and selling groceries.  Currently, Mrs. M.\u2019s income comes mainly from raising animals and selling groceries, and she also receives support from her children.  In total her income is about 6,000,000 VND (345 USD).  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 20,000,000 VND (1150 USD).  She will use part of the loan to buy more pigs to raise, and the remainder she will invest in her grocery shop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

She has always enjoyed management and hoped to have her own prosperous business, and her dreams became reality eight years ago. With much effort and work outside the home, she was able to pull together enough money to install her own store in her home, and thanks to her good management skills it is still doing well. Every day she wakes up very early to do laundry and makes herself available for customer care, because mothers leave very early to do their grocery shopping. The difficult thing, however, is that the space is becoming smaller and smaller. In the future, she hopes to expand her store, which would be a great investment since her clients are very loyal and there are always new customers to serve. She has been working with MFP for six years. This is her 15th loan and she has always maintained good communication with her colleagues--their friendship forms a solid base for the group.

She has always been interested in making ornamental decorations and her sister taught her how to make these and to knit. Together, they have a sewing workshop in their home. Before, Lidia worked in an accounting firm, but since she retired, she has put into practice what she has learned from her sister. For 10 years, she has worked to make and sell seasonal clothing. This has led to new friends, who eagerly await her visits when she brings clothing and decorations for their homes. This business is very profitable, thanks to the creativity with which she crafts each item of novelty and good taste. Lidia and her sister wish to expand their workshop with new machines that will expedite and improve their production. She has worked with MFP for the past eight years. This is her 10th loan, and she is very happy with the great team she has formed with her neighbors.

Her desire to progress led her to break into business, which she learned from a couple of friends. From a young age, they taught her how to work with various beauty lines, which she has learned with great pleasure, always demonstrating patience in her practice. Over the last 10 years her good character has garnered a large clientele, and increased her sales. To be able to reach her sales goals, she goes out every morning until midday in search of new customers. She enjoys this activity, because she is able to meet new people with whom she can begin new friendships, but the downside is having to walk through the streets for hours taking orders or collecting payments, which she usually does in the afternoon. Laura plans to open a small store, because she also enjoys making sandwiches, which she usually does for social gatherings. She has been working with MFP for six years. This is her 10th loan and she has always demonstrated a dedication to learning and collaboration, which is characteristic of all the members of her group. With this loan of 2000 soles, she plans to buy a greater quantity of products to stock, which she can sell immediately from her home without having to wait on orders from her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":279438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase commodities for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-27T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":301.27},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":311.76},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":323.68},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":338.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":356.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":367.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.15},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.15},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.47},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":94.15,"local_amount":301.27,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":308.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117185,"comment":null},{"amount":97.42,"local_amount":311.76,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":319.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012096,"comment":null},{"amount":101.15,"local_amount":323.68,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":331.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595681,"comment":null},{"amount":105.86,"local_amount":338.74,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":346.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989943,"comment":null},{"amount":111.47,"local_amount":356.71,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":365.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211075,"comment":null},{"amount":114.95,"local_amount":367.84,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":376.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640575,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-28T05:25:27Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92173,"name":"Bui Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb B\u00f9i Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec7t n\u0103m nay  52 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb tham gia Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 2006.

The desire to advance motivates her to continue working, and for 2 years she has sold clothing every day in different parts of her area. She leaves very early in the morning to sell her merchandise in the markets or leave some garments in her friends' stalls, who kindly lend her a hand, which helps a lot. Jessica is very happy because her sales are improving thanks to the summertime. Since there is greater demand, she tries to take advantage of it by bringing summer clothes that she leaves with her best clients, who pay her every day. This practice is not very tiring because she can set her own schedule. The disadvantage is that she doesn't have a fixed income in her home and so the earnings that she can obtain each day are relative. Because of that, Jessica hopes to soon have a stand where she can display her products. She has worked with MFP for 5 years, and this is her eighth loan with the institution, which helped her not only to have economic support, but also to give her the chance to get to know the group members.

She began selling beauty products when she was much younger, but when she married she left this business to be a homemaker. The loss of her husband seven years ago prompted her to again take up selling cosmetics and she has invested funds in her business.  On a daily basis she visits a great number of people; every morning she works at securing new customers, something that she enjoys because she likes to meet and interact with people.

She is a woman who since the age of 20 has worked in several activities, but for the past 10 years she has begun selling clothes in the different markets in her District.  It is more profitable to sell in the further zones, because the people there don\u2019t have easy access to travel to the city to shop, and in other cases they have very restricted economic resources.  But in order to help her neighbors, Candelaria tries to have various items from the same factories, where she buys for a better price and sells to her clients at lower prices.  In the future, she wants to have a store where she could sell her items and other products in order to be on time completing services for her clients, at the moment this is the only company that she has.  Candelaria has spent 6 years working with MFP, and she hopes to continue with the institution that gives her help when she needs it most.

She is married and lives with her husband and her children in the home that they bought when they were married.  She has always had a special affection for animals, and since she was 10 years old she has worked raising pigs in the outskirts of her neighborhood, as reasons of hygene prevent her from having them inside her house.  It is for this reason that she works carrying buckets for the scraps of food that her neighbors collect.  They wait until 5 in the afternoon for Ms. Bertha to collect them.  These scraps are heated and prepared the following morning in her home, and then she takes them to her pigsty.  This work can be very difficult, due to the strength that she has to use to move the large quantities of food.  In the future, Bertha wants to increase the number of animals that she has, using her working capital, as it is the only activity that she learned as a child and that she can do.  She has worked with MFP for 5 years, and this is her tenth loan, and she is very happy to be part of a team so hardworking and collaborating.

She has great charisma and strong desires to grow, which is reflected in the work she has been doing for 10 years, which is selling metal articles such as the bases of sunshades or umbrellas. She makes them with a colleague inside the shop she has installed on the second floor of her home. But in order to make these various items she has to buy a variety of materials. So she leaves early in the morning to the metal stores to acquire what is needed and in this whay when they arrive at her shop she busies herself in designing large quantities, which later will be sold in various places in the jungle where Diola usually travels.

But that doesn\u2019t mean that her husband is jobless; sometimes he is a carpenter and sometimes a tricycad (bicycle with sidecar used as public transport) driver.<P>\r\n\r\nMs. G. is engaged in livestock raising, more specifically hog and cow fattening. She received her loan amounting to P 24,000 on February 9, 2009 with a term of 100 weeks. She learned this business since she was young; that\u2019s why she is knowledgeable in this business. This amount serves as additional capital to purchase 2 pigs and one cow. She dreams that soon she will have a durable and spacious pigpen and have additional cattle someday. She dreams also that she will send her children to school and see them finish their studies.<P>\r\n\r\nMs. G. wants to thank ASHI for all its initiatives for the poor and the Kiva lenders who will

The people in the municipality of Hamtic serve as the passengers for her husband's tricycad. <P>\r\n\r\nBecause of the effort, Ms. G. dreams that she will become a big-time businesswoman someday so that she will have her own lot and build a durable house to live in. She dreams also that her children will finish their studies.\tShe is thankful to Kiva lenders who will sponsor her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":279275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle

Resiko yang dihadapi I Nyoman Switra dalam mejalani usaha ini  juga cukup tinggi karena ayam jenis ini sangat rentan dengan serangan penyakit dan sangat terpengaruh pada suhu \/cuaca , sehingga memerlukan lingkungan yang sehat dan juga modal yang cukup untuk persediaan obat-obatan ataupun vaksin. Dan untuk mengatasi\/ menekan resiko tersebut I Nyoman Switra berencana melengkapi kandangnya dengan alat yang di sebut Blower ( sejenis kipas angin besar ) agar terjadi pertukaran udar yang lebih baik .Untuk Itu I Nyoman Switra sangat berharap mendapat pinjaman lagi untuk tahap yang kedua yang akan di pergunakan untuk membeli alat tersebut. \nDengan tambahan modal ini I Nyoman Switra akn merasa lebih tenang dan berharap hasil yang di dapat akan semakin meningkat, mengingat biaya yang di perlukan untuk menunjang  pendidikan anaknya yang kini telah duduk di bangku kuliah dan satu lagi masih SMP semakin  tinggi\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":279672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy feeds and blower","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Nyoman Switra","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92249,"name":"Aun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This small loan group is made up of four members, all residents in Odom Bang Commune, Battambang Province.

Her breeding cow has produced two offspring that is not ready to be sold yet.  To reap the reward, Ni Nengah Sulasmi needs to wait patiently for another 2 or 3 months for the little cows to mature and ready to be marketed.  However, Ni Nengah Sulasmi is very enthusiastic about her business that she bought a share of a male cow to increase her farm's production.  Most of Sulasmi's time is spent on farming her cows and pigs.  She is fortunate that her eldest son that just finished high school starts helping in the farm by procuring grass for feeds.  Ni Nengah Sulasmi's livelihood is dependent on her far,.  Her husband works as a contract labor without steady income.  Ni Nengah Sulasmi is planning to purchase a male cow that she plans to farm for 5-6 month to maturity and then sell for profit.  So she is applying for a second loan from Kiva and Dinari for this purpose.  She is very hopeful that the improving the farm's profitability may help her family's economic situation, especially with growing daily expenses and her 2 children needs fund to continue their

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He requests 2500 Somoni to buy more cattle so as to expand his business. Let\u2019s get together behind the request of this devoted father to help him keep bringing well-being and security to the members of his family.<P>    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a hard-working person, and he makes an effort to give his four beloved children the best. He decided to stay in his homeland so that he could develop it, and now he carries out his everyday chores with a lot of love and affection as he cultivates the land and feeds his animals. <P>\r\n\r\nWith experience gained over 7 years in the purchase and sale of cattle, he has been able to bring stability to his family. He would now like to purchase cattle that can create more income for his large family. For this reason he requests 2500 Somoni. Anvar thanks you very much for your love of the less fortunate.   <P> \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

U. is a 37-year-old cattleman who is married with three children. Owing to his father, who was a farmer, Khidirali has been associated with this business since he was young. He purchases the cattle in the local market and then he breeds and sells them. The cattle are kept in the house and it takes a lot of effort to care for them. Every day, Khidirali gets up early in the morning in order to feed his animals. And all day, until late at night, he is busy looking after the cattle. Khidirali says that he works with only one aim in mind - to provide his children with proper education. Now, Khidirali would like to expand his business and purchase two cows. For this purpose, he has applied for 2000 Somoni and with your help he hopes to reach his aim. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key place along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The school has a total number of 296 pupils and with a staff of nine teachers and two security guards.<P>\r\n\r\nLast academic year, the school sent thirty-three candidates for the Basic Education Certificate Examination (NPSE) and twenty-six candidates passed with flying colors.

However, to assist other schools, FAWE allows pupils from other schools to take computer lessons in their school.<P>\r\n\r\nTeachers and other professional workers come to SMT to seek loans for different reasons. For some, since salaries are usually very small, they are prompted to engage themselves in businesses to supplement their meager salaries. Others, however, can not directly do business themselves; rather, they will invest whatever little they have into their wives\u2019 businesses. Some seek a loan in order to pursue further studies or to pay school fees for their children. And  others want a loan in order to buy pieces of furniture like chairs or a bed. Some want to either start building a house or continue with a house-building project they have already begun. It is for some of these reasons that teachers from FAWE have come to SMT to seek a loan. <P>\r\n\r\nAminata Victoria L. (first row, second from right) is the acting principal of the school.

Two of her children are grown-ups, one is in his second year in Fourah Bay College, University of Sierra Leone, the next is in Port Loko Teacher\u2019s Training College and the last is in secondary school. With this loan, Mrs. L. will pay for her two children in college. This will make her a happy woman as she was having sleepless nights wondering where to get the money to pay her children's fees.<P>\r\n\r\nNote: SMT has just opened a new branch in Waterloo and teachers of FAWE are the first individuals to collect a loan from this branch.

It was founded in 1950 by the Seventh Day Adventist Mission. Very recently, the school has been divided into Lower and Upper Primary Schools. The Lower is made up of the nursery and classes I \u2013 III. And the Upper Primary School is made up of classes IV \u2013 VI. It is a co-educational school with a total of 767 pupils and a staff of twenty teachers. Last year, the school sent 124 pupils for the National Primary Schools Examination (NPSE) and ninety of these pupils passed. By national standards, this was a very good result for the school. In sports, such as football (soccer) and athletics organized by the Ministry of Youths and Sports, the school also usually does well.<P>\r\n\r\nWith the loan, some of the staff members will start a small business, and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan in their businesses. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children's education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in building a house (buying building materials).  <P>\r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus maK. teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classrooms have to find alternative means of maK. ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salaries are not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.<P>\r\n\r\nSixty years old, Josephine A. S.

She has been living with her partner for more than 17 years and has seven children with whom she lives in her house.  Her husband works in the fields from morning til night:  he sows potato and olluco [a root vegetable] in temporary fields and irrigated fields while Aurelia takes care of the home in the morning.  She says that her work starts with washing her baby's diapers and then cooking breakfast.  Later, she brings her livestock to the fields and on her return she brings her partner his breakfast.  Finally, she helps him in the fields until 6:00 P.M.  In all this time her potato and olluco plantings in different seasons have only served to sustain her household because sometimes she does not have a good harvest due to a lack of fertilizing enough and she is not able to cover her entire sowing area which has resulted in poor harvests and could not be sold at market as the vegetables were riddled by worms.  Despite her financial problems, Aurelia and her husband continue to sow.  The loan they are requesting will allow them to continue to sow with the goal of making progress in this enterprise.

She is the mother of two children who live in her home. Her parents were farmers and she inherited their land along with the responsibility to work that land, being the only her only source to generate income for herself and support her family. Consequently Norma gets up around 5 in the morning to prepare meals so that at 8 in the morning she can take her cattle to pasture and in this way have enough time to take her husband lunch. He works on the farm, helping with the planting of beans, potatoes, and corn. But sometimes they have difficulty; as when the mold from excessive rain causes the worms to affect the crop, so he has to be constantly checking his crops and in this way attempt to prevent the pestilences that can affect the farm and in this way save his crops. Normal likes farming even though she doesn\u2019t always earn as much money as she hopes. Her short term and long term plans are based on her earnings from her crop production. Norma has the spokesperson position in her communal bank. This is her second loan with MFP and in all this time she has demonstrated great responsibility with her payments.

La agricultura es parte de las buenas costumbres que le heredaron sus padres, en todo este tiempo ha tratado de sembrar mayor cantidad arvejas y habas, aunque \u00e9stas en menor cantidad por ser de menor ganancia. Ra\u00fal procura alquilar chacras donde ya hayan crecido papas anteriormente, esto facilita la siembra de arvejas, ya que de un saco de granos de arvejas, llega a cosechar de 50 a 60 sacos, esto lo realiza 3 veces como m\u00e1ximo en la misma chacra. Pero no todo es bueno, ya que Ra\u00fal en ciertas oportunidades se ve amenazado por las plagas que se implantan en las chacras por la excesiva lluvia, y tambien la helada (clima helado), sabiendo que si la rancha ataca a sus cultivos, se puede contrarrestar con funguicidas y pesticidas, pero con la helada no hay soluci\u00f3n alguna para salvar los cultivos. Ra\u00fal est\u00e1 muy feliz con sus cultivos de arvejas, pese a las dificultades que tiene, los precios lo alientan a seguir sembrando, ya que son muy rentables para \u00e9l. \u00c9l es secretario de su banco comunal, en cada una de las reuniones est\u00e1 encargado de redactar todos los acuerdos, este es su 2do pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo viene pagando puntualmente sus cuotas.

Farming is part of the good habits he inherited from his parents, he has always tried to grow a large quantity of peas and beans, even though these in smaller quantity products smaller profits. Ra\u00fal was able to rent farms where they previously grew potatoes, and this facilitated growing peas, as from one sack of pea seeds he can harvest 50-60 sacks, and this he does at the most 3 times on the same farmland. But not all is well, as Ra\u00fal has been threatened by various plagues on his fields because of excessive rain, and also frost (in this cold climate), knowing that if a pestilence attacks his crops, he can use fungicides and pesticides, but with the frost there isn\u2019t a way to save his crops. Ra\u00fal is very happy with his pea crops, despite the difficulties that he has, the prices support him continuing to grow this crop as they are very profitable for him. He is secretary of his communal bank; at each of the meetings he is in charge of recording all the agreements. This is his 2nd loan with MFP, and all this time he has been punctual with his payments. The money he seeks is to buy fertilizer for his next pea planting and with the sales of his peas buy seeds.

She has a son and together they live in her parent's house where Yessi has her business.  Since she was little, Yessi has helped her parents in the fields and since she decided to form her own family, she has dedicated herself to agriculture.  At the same time, she also attended to her store which she has run for the last two years since her parents transferred it to her.  Yessi tried to increase the merchandise in the store, including acquiring more drinks and groceries which has resulted in better sales and profits than just groceries alone. Yessi loves this business because money is constantly in motion and this encourages her to keep with the business. For this reason she opens the store before 6 am every day and stays until 10 pm (at which time she cares for her plants). At the same time, she helps her mother graze cattle. Yessi's hops for the future are to increase the inventory in her store, plant peas, and sell more products in greater quantities so that she can become a prosperous businesswoman. Yessi is very active in her village bank, called \"Campo Verde\", where she is the treasurer.  This is her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and in this time she has shown her responsibility through the work in this position and by making her payments on time. The money she is soliciting is to stock her store with groceries and candies.

Luego que su padre fuera a trabajar de pe\u00f3n a las chacras del pueblo de Huasahuasi (zona denominada \u201cCapital de la papa del Per\u00fa\u201d), not\u00f3 que no hab\u00edan negocios de comida, como por ejemplo desayunos para los agricultores; entonces de regreso a su hogar comunic\u00f3 a su familia la idea de ser pioneros en la venta de comida; como jugos de maca, quinua, leche y s\u00e1ndwich diversos, para de ese modo captar ganancias para su econom\u00eda. Se inici\u00f3 con una carreta peque\u00f1a preparando desayunos al paso, logrando una  buena aceptaci\u00f3n, debido a ello, su madre migr\u00f3 hacia ese lugar y puso otra carreta, pero esta vez de guisos. Es as\u00ed que Yudy sigue con el negocio familiar que en todo este tiempo le ha resultado muy rentable, por ello empieza su actividad de dos y media a cinco de la ma\u00f1ana, instal\u00e1ndose en el parque de la zona, donde todos sus clientes la esperan, hasta las diez de la ma\u00f1ana que es cuando termina con la venta. Yudy se siente muy contenta con su negocio, sus metas pr\u00f3ximas son de aperturar un nuevo negocio con la venta de bebidas en un local alquilado. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y le han delegado el cargo de vocal, que promete cumplir con mucha responsabilidad, del mismo modo hace el compromiso de pagar todas sus cuotas en las fechas programadas. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de harina de maca y de soya para sus mates y jugos, y otra parte la usar\u00e1 para iniciar su negocio de venta de bebidas.","en":"Yudy is 22 years old and has lived with her partner for the past 3 years. She migrated to a town called Huasahuasi 3 years ago, where she lives in a rented house.  When her father went to work as a labourer in the farmland of Huasahuasi (a region known as the potato capital of Peru), she noted that there weren't any businesses selling meals, for example breakfast for the farmers.  When she returned home she told her family her idea that they could be pioneers in the sale of food, including the juice of maca (a nutritionally rich root vegetable which grows in the high mountains of Peru), quinoa, milk and a variety of sandwiches. In this way they could gain income.\r\n\r\nShe started with a small cart preparing quick breakfasts. Achieving a good response, her mother then migrated to the town to run another cart, but this time selling stews.  It is in this way that Yudy continues with the family business that has been very profitable during all of this time. She starts working between 2.30am and 5.00am, locating her cart in the neighbourhood park where all her customers wait for her. She works through until 10.00am, when she finishes her sales for the day. Yudy is very happy with her business.

El arte del bordado siempre fue lo que le llamaba la atenci\u00f3n desde jovencita, tuvo la oportunidad de trabajar bordando hace 4 a\u00f1os desde que conoci\u00f3 a su mejor amiga, quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 esta labor y la impuls\u00f3 para trabajar bordando prendas para exportaci\u00f3n, pues todos los d\u00edas tienen grandes cantidades pedidos que realizar. Desde entonces, viene trabajando todos los d\u00edas dentro de su hogar donde puede sentirse c\u00f3moda junto a sus seres queridos. Lo dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es cumplir con las grandes cantidades de prendas pues es muy cansado mantener su mano trabajando al mismo ritmo continuamente. Gladys espera que en el fututo pueda tener un taller de bordados, donde las m\u00e1quinas puedan ayudarla a producir mayores cantidades de prendas. Hace 4 a\u00f1os que trabaja con MFP, y est\u00e1 muy contenta de formar tan bonito grupo de trabajo junto a sus amigas. El dinero que solicita lo utilizar\u00e1 para comprar mayor cantidad de materiales; como hilos y telas para sus bordados.","en":"39-year old Gladys lives with her husband and two children in her mother-in-law\u2019s house. The art of embroidery has always attracted her ever since she was a child. She got the opportunity to work in embroidery four years ago when she met her best friend who taught her how to do it. Her friend encouraged her to embroider clothes for export as they always have a large number of orders to complete. Since then, she has been working every day from her home where she feels comfortable close to her beloved family. The difficult part of her work is to complete the large number of clothing orders since it is very tiring for her hand to maintain the constant rhythm. Gladys hopes in the future to have her own embroidery workshop where machines can help her produce a larger quantity of clothing. Four years ago she started working with Kiva partner MFP and is very happy to be part of such a nice group and to be working alongside her friends. The money she is asking for will be used to buy a larger quantity of supplies such as thread and material for her embroidery.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

She and her husband live in their own house with their two children. Ever since she was young, she has partaken in various business activities. From those profits, she has been able to set up a refrigerator in her house to sell ice cream and soft drinks to the people who pass through her neighborhood. For Elsa, increasing her profits is a reflection of a good investment, and she always tries to manage her business adequately. For this reason, he has been distributing great amounts of soft drinks for all occasions. Because her orders are big, she is able to earn big profits. Her future plan is to become a wholesale distributor, without setting aside the goal she has of setting up a general store inside her home in which she can sell basic need items. This is her fourth loan with MFP, the institution that helped her improve her business and establish friendships in her neighborhood. With this loan money, she will purchase a greater amount of soft drinks from suppliers so that she can fill her orders. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":280019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-03T08:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117208,"comment":null},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012119,"comment":null},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595704,"comment":null},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989967,"comment":null},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211098,"comment":null},{"amount":128.65,"local_amount":415,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":420.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640600,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-04T13:38:50Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92417,"name":"Bulat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Bulat S..

She had always wanted her own business, and 5 years ago she established one selling used clothing in the Barrio Central neighborhood of the city of Bluefields. The clothing she buys is from the United States and she buys it in Managua. With this business being well-established, Lesbia has a good network of habitual customers, and she lets them know when she has a new bundle of clothing.                                              \r\n\r\nLesbia is married and has 4 children.

Lesbia has already received a loan from ADEPHCA and she used it to grow her business and she had no troubles with the payments for the loan. Since she had such success with the first loan, she is requesting another. With this money, she will buy a bale of children\u2019s clothing for US $200.00, a bale of adult clothing for US$150.00, a bale of sheets for US$150.00, and a bale of towels for US$100. She has sold the majority of these things in the past, but she will use a part of this loan to grown her business to include sheets, which she has never sold but which customers are requesting. \r\n\r\nLesbia has many dreams for her family. She currently has a wooden house, and she would like to build one of cement. Also, she has children who want to go to good universities in the city of Le\u00f3n, which is located in a different area Nicaragua.

Nelie D. P., 34 years old, single, presently resides at Talic, Oroquieta City. As a young woman, she already knew how to earn money for her needs and for her family as well.

Her customers are her neighbors, friends, and relatives. <P>\r\n\r\nWhen she was already accepting orders from other people, aside from her usual customers, she joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative for additional working capital. She was recognized as a member in February 2004. In fact, this is already her 5th loan. Now she is applying for PHP 14,950 to buy ingredients for \u201cSuman\u201d making.<P>\r\n\r\n By having this loan she can address the orders of her customers.

Now she\u2019s on her 7th loan cycle and is asking to be granted a loan amounting to P 10,000.<P>\r\n\r\nShe is planning that the store will have its own building so it will be separate from her home.  She hopes that their financial status will grow, thru the help of the business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbove all, she is so thankful for the trust Paglaum gave her, that she\u2019s able to avail herself of the credit services of PMPC.  And because of that, she tries her very best to cope with her responsibilities as a Paglaum member, being religious in paying amortizations on time, as well as  the weekly savings and share capital and attending meetings regularly. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":280302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is an active and responsible woman, but unlucky in marriage. She got married once but was divorced because she and her husband did not get along well. She single-handedly raises up her son. Thus, she faces many difficulties, as she does not only have to worry about finances but also shoulders the responsibility of being both a mother and a father for her son. Everyday, besides working on the farm and rearing pigs, she also does carpenter works at home to increase income. Her average daily income is about 80,000 to 100,000VND. Though facing hardship, she was still able to repay well her previous loan. This time, she would like to borrow 4,704,000VND over the course of 50 weeks to rear pigs. Her group also consists of:\r\n<li> Mrs. N. Thi Hang, borrows 2,016,000VND to purchase bran for pigs. <\/li>\r\n<li> Mrs. N. Thi Hat, borrows 3,808,000VND to purchase pigs and bran for pigs. <\/li>\r\n<li> Mrs. Ngo Thi P., borrows 2,016,000VND to purchase bran for pigs. <\/li>\r\n<li> Mrs. N.

Selling of used clothing has a very big market in Ghana as brand-new clothes, shoes, and materials are very expensive for the economically active poor.

Her store is easily accessible to her customers because it is along the highway.  She is currently requesting a 5,000 loan amount for additional capital for her grocery store.  She needs to buy additional food, toiletries, and household items, too.  Way back when Allen started her Sari-Sari store, she only infused a small capital into her business. She can't imagine how it expanded and grew.  But she realizes that it is because of the training and support of our staff who never cease to explain the right way of managing a small capital and the concept of saving.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married with two children. He is a market vendor from Dushanbe where he sells teenagers' clothing. Umedjon is very enterprising, has vast experience working as a vendor, and is full of creative ideas. A reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in his work and have helped to ensure the success of his business. Umedjon has been running his business for many years. In general he has about 6 years of experience selling clothing. Currently, he is requesting a loan of $900 USD to increase his inventory. He promises to repay the loan within 12 months. He believes that having this additional turnover capital will help him minimize his sales risk and provide stable financial support for his family. Moreover, it will help him get closer to his ultimate goal of purchasing a big store of his own. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her business is located in the central market of Dushanbe and she sells clothes for women. Thanks to the support of her spouse and her own effort she was able to expand her business, which began with little inventory and in a small space and now has a bigger space and a large clientele. With the loan of $ 900 USD, which she will repay in 6 months, she will buy a greater variety of clothing styles, for a variety of occasions, and a few specific requests of her customers. Support this woman of much strength and courage to keep working.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muzayam is the humble mother of a family with two children and she works hard to educate them. She has worked in agriculture, along with her husband, for 5 years, to generate the family\u2019s income. They work hard at growing vegetables, which they sell in the market. Last season was very productive, and after much effort, they had achieved a big harvest. Her husband went the market to the sell the crop of their labor. Currently Muzayam\u2019s family has a financial problem and she needs help. The family wishes to continue planting vegetables and increase their capital to purchase more seed and fertilizer.

Let\u2019s help this family to remain strong and united. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.
