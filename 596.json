Hace 6 a\u00f1os Mercedes puso, con mucho esfuerzo, una bodega en su propio domicilio,  Mercedes vende productos de primera necesidad as\u00ed como abarrotes (arroz, az\u00facar, aceite).

She is a single mother who lives with her two children in a house that her ex-husband left her before they separated.  Her home has electricity but does not have piped water or sewerage services.  It is located in Las Lomas district, in Piura.\r\n\r\nMercedes receives a monthly maintenance payment for her children.  However, this is not enough to cover all of their expenses and, for this reason, Mercedes has a great desire to do better, for her children's sake.  Six years ago, with a lot of effort, Mercedes set up a grocery store in her own home.  She sells essential household products such as groceries (rice, sugar and oil).  She serves in her store every day and has an established customer base.\r\n\r\nMercedes is requesting a loan for 1,200 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa which she will use to buy products for her business (mainly groceries).  This will allow her to continue selling and earning money to meet her childrens' needs.\r\n\r\nMercedes would really like to increase her stock and thereby her sales so that she can continue growing in her business.

Mi\u1ebfn is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Trung B\u1ea1n - nh\u00f3m 08 (8).\n\nMi\u1ebfn is married and has four school-aged children.  To make a living, Mi\u1ebfn owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.  Mi\u1ebfn has been engaged in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 3,400,000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Mi\u1ebfn joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mi\u1ebfn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,392,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  This will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Mi\u1ebfn plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1. L\u1ee3i is a 29-year-old woman who is requesting a 8,288,000 VND loan to support her business  manufacturing tables, chairs, and cabinets.\n\n\n2. Hoa is a 31-year-old woman who is requesting a 6,496,000 VND loan to support her business manufacturing beds and wardrobes.\n\n\nAbout SEDA:\n\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nMi\u1ebfn N.

is married and the young father of one son.

His group is very popular in his region and he has many orders for different events. \r\n\r\nEach performance depends on different occasions and makes good memories. That\u2019s why he tries to make his clients happy  in order to give them good memories. For this purpose he requested a loan of 4700 Somoni to purchase a a keyboard. \r\n\r\nBesides this business he is running an animal husbandry business and processing dry fruits at home. This loan will be the fourth loan for Anvarjon from Imon International and he has a good credit history.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 45 years old, married, and has three children between the ages of 16 and 18. All the children go to school. He takes care of his father, who lives in Inhambane, by sending him 1,000 meticais' worth of basic goods every three months.\n\nArmando Leonardo left Inhambane to move to Namaacha District during wartime in search of work. For 12 months he worked as a domestic employee, then decided to start his own business selling prepaid Mcel\/VODAcom phone cards and offering currency exchange. He has a good hold on the market because he makes sales at the border and cannot satisfy customer demand. He works from 7:00 am until 8:00 pm, when the border closes, and he has two employees. He makes a profit of 7,000 meticais per month, and he used his profits to build his own house which is ready for roofing.\n\nThis is Armando Leonardo's fifth loan with Hluvuku and his second with Kiva. The first three loans (for 5,500 meticais, 10,000 meticais and 7,000 meticais) were used to sell prepaid phone cards.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His wife looks after the kids at the moment. \n\nGansukh has been working at a mill factory as a flour packer since 2004. In 2011, he bought a plot of land and a small house with his savings. The house was cheap, but really run down and needs proper renovation and insulation from the cold. \n\nMongolian winter is one of the harshest in the world reaching minus 40 to 45 degrees at night. Houses without insulation require burning coals for the whole night to keep the warmth. Plus it requires more use of coal, which is costly and pollutes the air and environment as well. Therefore Mr.Gansukh wants to do a proper renovation of the house, making it warmer.

Khadija is a housewife who stays at home and takes care of her children. \r\n \r\nHer husband has a job in the factory. His salary is not enough to meet the financial expenses of his family. So in order to supplement the income, he operates a donkey cart and offers loading services to the clients. Khadija has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to buy a new donkey cart for her husband because his current cart has become rough and needs to be replaced. By purchasing a new donkey cart, Khadija hopes that her husband will be able to put more loads on it and perform his work well. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application. In a previous loan year, she proved herself as a responsible client by paying her installments on time and by attending every meeting. \r\nNote: \u201cIn the photo, the lady raising her hand is

Their family currently resides in Silang, Cavite.\r\n\r\nJosefina manages the sari-sari store on her own, opening daily and offering a variety of goods such as biscuits, candies, cupcakes, beverages and toiletries to cater to her neighborhood's immediate needs. She also sells electronic mobile phone loads for cellphone users in the community. Josefina has been in this business for 30 years and the store is located adjacent to their house for practical reasons. She earns a monthly net income of PHP 5,600.\r\n\r\nJosefina has applied for a PHP 14,000 loan with the help of CCT*. She intends to use this loan to replenish her stock of goods, seeking quality and affordable brands for her customers. She acknowledges this loan as a big help to her and a way to increase her profits.\r\n\r\nAt present, Josefina also struggles with debts of customers who have the habit of escaping their bills. She finds ways to follow up on these customers regularly to solve the issue. It is Josefina's desire for her business and family to be successful and  strong in the years to come. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Einstein once said, \"Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.\" This is what Gloria S., 60, does to make the most out of her life. At 60, Gloria has already lost her life partner. She currently lives with her children and young grandchildren in Silang, Cavite. Gloria finds fellowship and entrepreneurial training in CCT*, where she is one of thousands of Community partners.\r\n\r\nGloria is a fruit and vegetable dealer. She primarily sells tropical fruits like mangoes and pineapples, as well as fresh vegetables for every-day meals. Gloria's commercial space is located in another municipality; while she lives in Silang, her store is located in Kawit (still in Cavite). Monthly she earns a net income of Php5,400. \r\n\r\nDue to previous financial struggles,  Gloria decided to request a loan of Php10,000 to help her grow her business. She will use this to purchase more fruit and vegetables to add to the array of goods in her store. Gloria will only pick the freshest produce to sell to her valued customers. Gloria says that this loan will impact greatly on her business capital.\r\n\r\nAt present, one struggle she has is the long lists of debts accrued by some of her customers. Gloria will make use of her 38 years of experience in the business to solve this issue. She aims to improve her business and include more products to sell. Above all, she hopes that her children will be successful and that her grandchildren will finish their education. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

said that a person's success is not only measured by what he or she does in this lifetime, but by what that person imparts to the next generation. This is the reason that Yolanda G., 54, does well to improve her farm business--not just for herself but for her children as well. Yolanda's husband died a few years ago and, at present, she strives to raise their two children who are both in school. They currently reside in Silang, Cavite, south of the country capital, Manila.\r\n\r\nYolanda takes care of her own farm where she grows pineapples and bananas. When ripe, she sells these fruits to the community market and earns quite a lot. Also, she grows peanuts and sells them to business connections. This kind of business works as a lot of Filipinos love to eat steamed peanuts, fried peanuts and even peanuts turned into peanut butter. She also has a sari-sari (variety) store to cover whatever family needs remain. Yolanda earns around Php10,000 net income monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her improve her peanut business, she decided to borrow Php30,000. She will use this loan in line with applying the entrepreneurial training she receives in CCT*. She will purchase necessary materials and acquire human resources to boost her peanut dealership. She says that the loan will largely support her business capital and enable her to make it grow.\r\n\r\nAt present, her difficulty is a low volume of product deliveries resulting is a low rate of sales. Nevertheless, Yolanda never gives up hope of making this business grow and continually strategizes for growth, because she knows this business will not only sustain her and her family now, but will be beneficial for her children in the future. She wants her eldest son to have a successful marriage someday. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":770666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to boost her peanut dealership","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-18T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4049.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195104,"comment":null},{"amount":186.67,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8098.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474125,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10123.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636906,"comment":null},{"amount":186.67,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8098.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005217,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-18T04:31:17Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":298817,"name":"Adjeniya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe ADJENIYA est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui vivent toutes dans la m\u00eame localit\u00e9 \u00e0 S\u00e8kandji dans la commune de S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji.

is a 49-year-old farmer from the village of Ghaniri.

His older son serves in the Georgian Army and the younger son goes to school. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is agriculture. In particular, they have three milk cows. The milk is used for cheese production. Approximately 80 kg of traditional Georgian cheese is sold per month. Also, they own 2 ha of land, where maize is grown; four tons of maize is harvested annually, 0.5 tons of which is sold on the market. The rest of the corn is used in the family. Along with the above-mentioned, Ilia and Maya grow strawberries on a plot with an area of 400 sq. meters. Approximately 300 kg of strawberries are sold during the season. \r\n\r\n500 Laris from the requested credit will be used for tilling and fertilizing the land. After the above-mentioned processes, Ilia and Maya will get more and better quality harvest and sell it for a higher price. That will positively impact the income of the family. With the remaining 700 Laris Ilia and Maya will purchase a new refrigerator for their house. \r\n\r\nThe received profit will be used for expansion of the dairy farm.

Rocio will purchase soap, seeds, dried chili, soft drinks, eggs, and sugar. \r\n\r\nJuana will purchase bottles and fragrances to make cleaning supplies. \r\n\r\nAriana will purchase pork rinds, ice, sugar, and vegetables to start her business. \r\n\r\nRocio is 22 years old and she has a grade 9 education. She lives with her partner and she has 2 daughters. Evenlyn is 6 years old and she is in preschool and Giovana is 2 years and 4 months old. She has a grocery store named \"Escondida\". She requests a loan to purchase merchandise, including soft drinks, eggs, sugar, soaps, cooking oil, seeds, dried chili, bathroom tissue, etc. She started her business 3 years ago although it was her husband's idea. He had a bakery in Mexico City where he made Chinese bread, but he sold the business with the money he bought land in the city of Cuautla. He built a house and started to purchase merchandise for the store. What she most enjoys about the business is that she earns an income and the business is profitable. And because it is in her house she is able to take care of her daughters.  The profits from her business are reinvested into the purchase of more merchandise, to pay for her daughter's school expenses, and for food. Her hopes and dreams are to build a second floor to her house. \r\n\r\nSan Pedro Apatlaco is beautiful and tranquil. It is a rural region where sugar cane, onions, and jicamas are cultivated.

The group was named this because the location where they meet is in the open and in the mornings one can appreciate the start of a new day and the rising sun. \r\n\r\nBrigida is one of the members of the group. She is 39 years old and she is married with Bernabe. She has 4 children, 2 of whom are married, and 2 are in primary school. She has been selling clothing for 2 years. She started the business because she used to get bored at home and she needed to do something to keep her occupied, so she started to sell clothing. At the start her sales were low because she only sold to her clients and family but with the passage of time her sales have been increasing. She goes out to other communities to sell her products. This business is very important to her, not only because it occupies her time but also because it helps with the school expenses of her 2 young children and with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nBrigida requests a loan to purchase more clothing. This is the season when sales are very good and she needs to have more variety. She will purchase: blouses, skirts, beach shirts, t-shirts, undergarments, pants, and hats.  She will increase the variety the products to offer her clients, as they are the most important reason why her business has been increasing. \r\n\r\nShe comments that her business has been doing very well, although there are times when it is a little quiet and there are almost no sales. But during other times she is able to recover and it has gone very well. She hopes that it will go well so that she will be able to make her payments and to help her husband with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dram is to see her children earn a career and to be in good health, which are the most important things in life. \r\n\r\nThe group \"Frente al Sol\" is thankful for the support granted to them and it is thanks to this that they will be able to revitalize their business and to keep it growing.

He and his wife work together with a family member in the shop. He needs many helpers to speed up the work and to meet the demand and the various orders that have been placed. Sometimes he wants to hire two more people to help him with his project. He enjoys his business. As a boy he learned to value family support and it has given him the opportunity to enjoy happy moments with them. For the years of experience in the business he has fixed clients who always request these skirts and he also earns new clients. He hopes to purchase a new sewing machine.

This Kiva loan is her first one with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo and she will use it to buy fabric, thread, lace and accessories to fulfil orders for women's dresses that she has already received. Her goal is to improve the distribution of her infrastructure even further, so that the workshop is located in separate premises. In the meantime, Nancy continues to work and to generate a profit no less than 45%.

From that moment everything began to flow and his business gradually showed signs of growth.  Gonzalo faces the great challenge of not having enough capital to keep up with product demand, so he is requesting his first loan with Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will buy lubricants and filters in large volumes, like he currently does, in order to get significant discounts on the products that have very quick turnover.  \n\nHis dream is to have an oil and lube center that is well-stocked so that he can generate enough income to help other family members just as he had been helped.  While continuing to pursue his dream, Gonzalo strives to achieve a profit margin of no less than 15%.  It is very likely that Gonzalo will work to achieve this goal.   \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":815.1,"image":{"id":771030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase lubricants and filters in large volumes.

She starts working very early, at approximately 4 a.m., when she is already up and ready to knead the dough and make the breads that everyone in her neighborhood enjoys. She is a very skilled baker, and that's because she learned the trade from her father since she was very young. What she enjoys most about her work is making the breads, which she does with a lot of care. She has had this job for five years, and the thing she considers to be the most difficult is getting up so early every morning, since for her weekends and holidays don't exist. In the future, her goal is to have a store where she could sell the items she bakes herself. This is her third loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she wants to have the funds to repay it, so she is ready to save day by day.

She lives in her own home together with her husband, 39-year old Rogelio, and their 2 dear children, to whom she wants to offer a better future.  Carmen has been making her living selling beauty products for 2 years now.  She shows her customers the merchandise from a catalog.  She likes her work a lot, since she is able to do it in her free time, which allows her to keep up with her housework.  She goes out to sell her products every day, selling both to people she knows and to new customers.  She walks long hours under the constant inclemency of the weather, but it doesn't get her down.  When she works, she has regular income, with which she can help her husband pay the household expenses.  What Carmen doesn't like is that often there are customers who are late in their paying for their products, which keeps Carmen from paying her invoices on time, and that causes a decrease in her working capital.

She also sells some cold meats and different sweet treats.  She tells us that on Thursdays and Fridays she sells dinners such as 'pozole' and 'corundas' (meals from her region). \r\n\r\nClementina has owned her grocery store for approximately 13 years and started the business because a neighbor of hers used to sell groceries.  Her neighbor moved house and there wasn't another store nearby.  Clementina therefore thought to set up a table selling sweet treats.  She gradually invested in groceries and stocked her business.  She says that, thanks to her loans from the institution, she has increased her profits as she has managed to stock up with items that she didn't used to sell.  She supplies her products to different stores in her town.\r\n\r\nClementina is married to Leonel who works for a company that makes baked goods.  They have three children who are all married.  Clementina's goal is to open special premises for her grocery store since right now she only has some shelves in her living room.\r\n\r\nThe other ten members of the group are Maria Socorro, Reyna, Isabel, Stephanie, Patricia, Magdalena, Rocio, Vianey, Teresa and Marisol.

young entrepreneur at 34, Marifi continually finds ways to improve her business. Marifi finished high school and is married to Isagani, a driver. They have two children, one who studies in elementary school and one who is not yet of school age. Their family resides in Silang, Cavite, south of Manila.\n\nMarifi manages her own sari-sari (variety) store. Along with grocery items and beverages, she also sells liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and maintains a poultry supply. Marifi handles these businesses on her own without the assistance of any employees and earns around PHP 10,800 a month. She also attends weekly fellowship* and undergoes entrepreneurial training in CCT* to sharpen her skills and strengthen her relationship with God.\n\nTo help her grow her business, she is borrowing PHP 29,000. This she intends to use to purchase more products to fill her store shelves. She deems this necessary because she observed that customers are attracted to buy when there are a lot of items on display. She also plans to purchase more LPGs for sale. \n\nMarifi is thankful for the opportunity to be given a loan because it will surely help her to meet her family's daily needs and assist her in renovating their house.\n\nMarifi confesses that she is threatened by the competition brought by the newly opened store near them. She also says that at times her sales are low because she has to open her store only after she has brought her children to school. But she believes she can overcome these struggles with new strategies and make her dreams a reality. She dreams of opening another store and of being able to send her children all the way to college.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

is an obstacle to optimum performance. That is why Zenaida works hard to make sure she doesn't get behind because of the lack of ability to perform well--be it in business or in her family life. At 60, she is a persevering micro entrepreneur, a loving life partner and mother, and a dedicated community partner in CCT*. She co-heads a family with Salvador. They reside in General Mariano Alvarez (GMA), Cavite, south of Manila.\n\nZenaida currently runs her own sari-sari (variety) store. Aside from handpicking brands and products that suit the tastes of her customers, Zenaida also sells fresh fish for her fellow community members. She makes sure she delivers only the best food for them. Her space is located in the community market in GMA. Also, she rents out an apartment to workers who choose to live independently. Monthly she is able to earn PHP 11,900.\n\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she has applied for a loan of PHP 17,000. This she will use to purchase more stocks of products like canned goods and soft drinks, sugar and coffee and liters of cooking oil. She also intends to make fresh fish available for her customers on a regular basis. According to Zenaida, this loan will help her earn more and thus save more for the schooling of her children.\n\nZenaida admits that there are times when the sales are so low she doesn't seem to make any profit at all. She also confesses that it's hard to do business alone since her husband had a stroke. But Zenaida does not want any incapability to hinder her from receiving God's best for her. She aims to make up for what is lost and make her store grow even more. Aside from building her own apartment, she also hopes to have her own vehicle for delivery, which the family can also use to attend activities at church. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\n\n
