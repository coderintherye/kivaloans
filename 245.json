tiene 43 a\u00f1os, es un hombre muy noble y trabajador, vive en su casa propia. Desde peque\u00f1o se dedica a la siembra y al cuidado de sus cultivos agr\u00edcolas, por lo que aprendi\u00f3 las t\u00e9cnicas de esta actividad que ahora realiza con mucha precisi\u00f3n. Alejandro sabe c\u00f3mo y cu\u00e1ndo sembrar la papa, arveja y ma\u00edz, por eso muchas veces sus vecinos le piden consejo para sus cultivos y esto lo reconforta y anima a seguir compartiendo sus conocimientos. La dificultad de Alejandro es en el momento de la comercializaci\u00f3n de sus productos en el mercado, pues tiene problemas de audici\u00f3n y no habla muy claro, adem\u00e1s su esposa es analfabeta y se limita a cuidar los productos mientras \u00e9l se esfuerza en hacerse entender con sus clientes. Pese a esta discapacidad tiene planes de surgir, por ello piensa comprar una motosierra para talar \u00e1rboles de su chacra y poder vender le\u00f1a, gener\u00e1ndose as\u00ed un ingreso adicional. Este es su octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, demostrando ser un cliente muy responsable y que le gusta asistir a todas las reuniones de su banco comunal para estar enterado de los acuerdos de su grupo. El dinero que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la comprar 20 sacos de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, calcula que le costar\u00e1 un aproximado de 2300 soles, con el resto del dinero comprar\u00e1 bolsas de arvejas (semilla). ","en":"\r\nAlejandro is 43 years old, he is a very noble and hard working man who lives in his own home. Since he was little he has spent time planting and taking care of his crops, so he was able to learn all the techniques of this activity, and now he does it with great precision. Alejandro knows how and when to plant potatoes, peas and corn, so many neighbors ask for his advice for their crops. This has reassured and encouraged him to continue sharing his knowledge. \r\n\r\nAlejandro's difficulty; however,  is in selling his products at the market as he has trouble hearing and speaking very clearly, besides this, his wife is illiterate and simply looks after the goods as he strives to understand their customers.

She is married to the father of her two children, and they live in their own house.\r\n\r\nWhen she was a young girl she worked to help her parents with their crops.  Once she got married, she did more agricultural work.  She worked arduously with her husband looking to get enough money to build their house.  They achieved that, and she now feels very satisfied.\r\n\r\nRosa trusts that God blesses her and allows her to have very good harvests, which bring her good income.\r\n\r\nShe does not stop there.  She has now bought a pair of sheep to breed.  She will start raising them and selling the meat in order to increase her income.  Rosa does this so that her children will not have economic difficulties.  They are studying at the university in the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She has just joined a long established community bank, and she promises to make her payments on time.  The money she is asking for is to increase her livestock and buy chemical fertilizers with the other part.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":353007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy animals and fertilizers for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-16T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1510,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734055,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T19:51:36Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122205,"name":"Rosario Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosario Marlene M.

Por ello este a\u00f1o ha preferido sembrar arvejas en chacras alquiladas donde solo paga entre 200 a 400 soles por siembra.

He is a very tranquil man and he lives with his wife in their own house.  They don\u2019t have any children.  His preferred crops are peas and gladiolos because of their profitability.  However, it is difficult to find a piece of land to plant gladiolos because it is believed that this flower impoverishes the land and if you obtain land, the rent is very expensive (between 700 and 900 PEN for each season).  As a result, this year he has preferred to plant peas on rented pieces of land where he only pays between 200 to 400 PEN each season.  In addition, this product is very profitable because in a single season he is able to harvest high quality fruit two times and he constantly fertilizes for the third harvest so that he has three high quality harvests.  In this way, he pays for the land rental and obtains earnings for his household expenses.  Samuel is very happy with his crops and he would like to purchase his own lands to plant his products.  This is his eighth loan with MFP and he tries to pay his bills on time because he doesn\u2019t like to fall behind.  At his community bank meetings he is always waiting for agreements that they have to join to work for the progress of the group.  The money that he is asking for will be invested in the purchase of 3 bags of peas (seed), as well as to pay the rent for the land where he will go to plant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":353013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of seeds and rent payment for the land parcel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-16T19:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2567,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734056,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-17T03:17:58Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122212,"name":"Maria Andrea","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Andrea E. reside en Armenia municipio de Sonsonate.

When we visited Sonia, she was very sad and angry, because the night before her corn, which is very costly until it matures, from her farm was stolen. As a result, she plans to sell the corn that she still has at a higher price in the market, so she won\u2019t end up with a large loss. Sonia works every day in agriculture with her husband, since it is their primary source of income. She alternates the crops that she grows; in January, she sows gladioli, which she harvests in May. In April, she sows peas, and in October, she plants potatoes. She spends all of her time working on her crops, which generates good earnings. Because of this, she will buy land in the next few months, where she will build her own house so that she can offer her children more comforts. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and she has made her repayments on time. Also, she likes to attend the meetings at her community bank, where she takes advantage of talking to and having a good time with her neighbors. The money that she requests will be used to buy chemical fertilizers, with which she will fertilize her pea farms that have already been sown. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":353022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-16T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":289,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":872.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842479,"comment":null},{"amount":561,"local_amount":1650,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1694.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734057,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T21:51:25Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122218,"name":"Ana Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Consuelo O. de 37 a\u00f1os de edad reside en el departamento de La Paz junto a sus cuatro hijos Cesar de 20 a\u00f1os, Maria de 16 a\u00f1os, Beatriz de 10 a\u00f1os y Nadia de 3 a\u00f1os de edad.

In light his father\u2019s illness, Wilder decided to be in charge of his younger siblings\u2019 education.  From then on he planted potatoes, peas, and beans in rented fields.  He pays between 600 and 700 PEN for each planting.  His mother helps him with the work.  During the week ends his father and his siblings help him.\r\n\r\nWilder is very happy to work the land and to be useful to his family.  This fills him with joy.  He has decided to plant his own crops for his own personal expenses.  In the potato fields, where he poses for the photo, he will plant peas to take advantage of the fertilizer\u2019s nutrients from the last planting.\r\n\r\nHe needs more investment in his potato crop due to the need for fertilizers.  When he does not get a good price at the market, he does not reach his expected income.  That is why he is going to plant more peas to reach his goal of having his own fields.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.

She is married with five children. Two children are currently out of school and independent, whiles the rest are still in school. She is very committed to her work and very resourceful to her family  because she believes the children are her future hope. \n\nShe sells smoked cow skin in the community market where she lives. Smoked cow skin is a popular source of meat used in preparation of sauces and favourite local dishes like \"waakye\" and \"banku\". She purchased stock of cow skin from herd men in northern region of Ghana and has been in business for three years now.

They are very close and have known each other for a while. They work in the following: \r\n\r\nEda Ventura C\u00e1ceres Z. works in grocery sales. A half a year ago she started a small grocery store, which operates under the name \u201cKensy\u201d. She has her business in the house where they live, and at the same time the store is a rented location because they do not own their own house. She is married and her husband works as a mason. They decided to start this business because the people who previously rented the house had a small grocery store and they took advantage of that fact to start the same type of business since the client base was already there. They have the goal that with the income that they both generate they will build their own house. At this time they only have a piece of land. \r\n\r\nRosa Elena R. G. has been working for 12 years making and selling tamales and hamburgers, which she does on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. She sells most of them in the street, and the rest from her house. Rosa is married and the mother of three children who depend 100% on the couple. Her husband works at a sawmill where he does welding work. Through her husband, Rosa has managed to sell her product inside the business where he works, and many of the employees that work there buy her product. Rosa decided to do this type of work because their economic situation is not good and her husband\u2019s income wasn\u2019t enough to cover all of the household expenses. Their living conditions have improved with the income that her business generates. She gives money to her husband to cover some of the household expenses.\r\n\r\nBlanca Lidia Gonzalez has been working as a seamstress for 17 years. She started out by selling used American clothing and when a bale came with very large clothing (XXL and larger), she would fix the items so that she could sell them and not lose out on the bale of clothing. Blanca now makes and sells thick blankets made of Dacron fabric. She buys the materials for making them. In the neighborhood where she lives, people say she is hardworking, honest and honorable, and of Christian principles. She has lived in the neighborhood for 19 years. She makes her sales as a street vendor and sometimes by request from her customers. Her customers work in a tobacco factory where one of her daughters works. Her daughter has taken it upon herself to support her by finding customers to buy the blankets. Blanca is a widow and she was on her own to get her children educated. They are now all working. With the income that she generates from her business she covers 100% of her personal expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":353149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To buy bread for hamburgers, ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, corn, salsa, mayonnaise, banana leaves, sugar, shortening, rice, coffee, eggs, chicken, spaghetti, soft drinks, and toilet paper.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-07-17T04:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eda Ventura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":19000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":3166.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3228.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73661550,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":3166.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T01:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3228.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87101585,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":3166.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3228.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97018604,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":3166.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3228.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863252,"comment":null},{"amount":341.68,"local_amount":6333.32,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6457.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110752940,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

G. is from the town of San Isidro, Mahinog Camiguin. She is 39 years old. Carmelita is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Carmelita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn November 2008, Carmelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Carmelita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Reine is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services he provides. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Reine from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Education of these three incurs a lot of expenses for Josephine and her husband to deal with. Her husband is a bus \"conductor\" (someone who is in charge of collecting passengers' fares and will command the driver to stop when passenger wants to ride or step off the bus), while Josephine has been making and selling \"nipa\" shingles. \r\n\r\n\"Nipa\" shingles is the most affordable roofing material in the province. This material is good for two to three years before it gets rotten. Poor people all over the province of Antique and those who live in very remote areas like the place where Josephine and her family live, can only afford this kind of roofing material. Therefore, Josephine thought of starting such a business. She will also be maximizing the resources which her village and community offers, because the \"Nipa\" plant is everywhere and a lot of people make \"Nipa\" shingles, however, they don't have access to marketing their product outside their village.\r\n\r\nJosephine wanted to address the issue faced by most poor people in their community. She started to grow her own business through loans she received from ASHI and she will still be expanding further by purchasing the products of people in her community to market in places outside their own village. Her loan will make this happen and will contribute to the improvement of the lives of poor people.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":353312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Ever since she had her own family, Rosita has tried different kinds of businesses to earn money for her family, especially for the education of her children. Through the support of her husband, she was able to send all of her children to school up to college. However, she did not have much time and capital to spend on her business. Her main priority then was family and the education of her children.\r\n\r\nWhen Rosita's children became responsible for themselves and got their own careers, she thought of expanding her business to give herself time to be with other people in their community. She joined ASHI in 2007, and she finds that she is achieving her dreams. The amount she is qualified to loan from ASHI has increased, thus she has more options to enhance the variety store she started. Her new loan is intended for purchasing additional goods to be sold in her variety store. The profits she will earn from her business will be saved for her future plans of growing her mini variety store to a general grocery store, which can accommodate the needs of people who want to put up their own mini variety store someday.

Thus, she joined ASHI in 2005 to have access to business capital through loaning. She then started cooking and selling food, buying and selling charcoal and selling ice.\r\n\r\nEventually, she thought of other businesses as her loanable amount in ASHI increased. Aside from her previous business she thought of raising livestock such as chickens, pigs, and cattle in their backyard. She lives in a mountainous area of the province of Antique, Philippines, and they have a wide, verdant space in their backyard that is good for raising animals. Some of these animals, after a certain period of time, will be sold and others will multiply. Her loan previously received is intended for this purpose. \r\n\r\nOut of the profit she will have in her businesses, she envisions that someday she will be able to build a stable house to shelter her

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a businesswoman who trades in Dumas clothes, linen and lace materials. She employs her own personal selling method, which she says makes her goods move very fast. She is 55 years old, and a divorced mother with three children. Two of her children are traders, and one is in school. Her trading business allows her to be very supportive of her family's needs. She has been selling for the past fifteen years, but progress has persistently been low due to insufficient funds. She hopes this loan will enable her to revive the business and make more viable profit. She wants to purchase Dumas clothes, linen and lace materials in bulk, to increase her inventory.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Abdusattor G. was born in 1975.  He is married and has 3 children.  He has a higher education.  However, he was not able to find a job in his profession.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Suraiyo is 38 years old. She is married and uses all the money she makes to care for her two children and to provide for their education. Suraiyo has 14 years of experience selling dried fruits. She makes very productive use of her capital, adding inventory to her supply in a way that allows her to meet her customers' needs. She is also very polite and considerate, and her clients are always very happy with the service they receive from her. Because her business is doing so well, she is increasing her net worth, month by month. Today, Suraiyo requests a loan of 3000 Somoni for purchasing dried fruits. Her purpose is to processing the fruits in order to increase the range of goods to be sold. Suraiyo expresses her gratitude for everyone supporting her and promises to repay her loan in a timely manner.\t\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gufron is married and has two children. He runs a small business selling wheat, corn and sunflower seeds in the local market. His place is located on the main market aisle where there are many customers every day. Gufron has been in this business for over 12 years. He is a high achiever and a consistent entrepreneur who is very knowledgeable about the market environment. His professional skills and perseverance have helped to ensure rapid growth and success of his business. Gufron is requesting a loan of 3000 Somoni to increase the assortment of his selling inventory. He is hoping that this loan will help his venture grow and generate extra profits. We believe that Gufron's ability to identify tasks critical to business success and set up a system for accomplishing them will allow him to continue growing in the sphere of private entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sharif is happily married to his wife. Their marriage has been blessed with 4 lovely children. Sharif has decided that he wants to live the rest of his life in the place where he was born. He not only loves the peaceful environment, but it also houses their major source of income, farming. He has been involved in farm activities since childhood. He is used to the heat of the sun. Sharif has worked as a farmer for the past 10 years. However, life has been difficult and progress slow. Because he lacks financial resources, Sharif would like to borrow 2500 Somoni so that he can buy seeds and fertilizer for his crop. Sharif has gained a reputation for responsibility with his financial obligations and for keeping his word. We are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bahrom is dedicated to the business of livestock. He distinguishes himself by having a lot of experience when it comes to livestock.

Both Bahrom and his loving family will benefit from this loan.   \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mirdjamol and his family have always been dedicated to agriculture. Mirdjamol is 44 years old, married and has 3 children. He has always been focused on making the land produce. His loans have generally been spent on the supplies necessary to obtain good production. In the future, Mirdjamol expects to have his own working capital which will allow him to cover his costs and buy more land so he can increase production and grow as a farmer. Currently he needs a loan of 4000 Somoni to continue purchasing farming supplies for his crop. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Rahmonkul buys calves on the market at a low price, feeds them and then resells in the same market at a more profitable price.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Pardakhol, age 42, is a married woman. She and her husband have two children. In the midst of their agricultural jobs, they show a great deal of optimism and confidence, putting all their effort in the farming of vegetables, which they later offer to wholesalers. All this effort is paying off, because they have recently started the construction of their own house. This has been a great source of motivation for them and, therefore, they wish to improve the quality of their products through a better use of raw materials and seeds. They are requesting a loan of 2600 Somoni which will help them to finish the construction of their dream house for which they have yearned so long.\r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Mamud is a hard-working man who is in agriculture. He has worked at this business for a long time and acquired his abilities in ranching and farming when he was very young. He is a married father with responsibilities for maintaining his 3 children. Mamud is known as being very responsible and hard-working, because every day, very early in the morning, he starts his job taking care of his fields and raising cattle in his own pen located at his house. IMON International has been the backbone of his business because they gave him loans which have allowed him to improve his standard of living through the acquisition of cattle and vegetables for planting. Today, once again, Mamud trusts that his credit will be approved and he will be able to improve his business with the purchase of cattle and farm supplies to plant.  \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He is 62 years old, married, and the father of 7 children with ages between 10 and 40 years old.  Only the three youngest are in school.\r\n\r\nAlberto left Gaza when he was a child for the capital, Maputo, in search of work.  He began working for a Portuguese official as domestic help.  Due to his dedication to his work the Portuguese was able to arrange a spot for him in one of the official schools, and he finished the 6th grade in the old system.\r\n\r\nYears later his boss returned to Portugal, and he was left unemployed.  He went to South Africa and worked in the mines, but due to the death of his brother during an excavation of a mine, his father demanded Alberto to leave that line of work claiming it was too dangerous.  He came to live with his sister who lived in the town of Namaacha which borders Swaziland.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he was able to arrange a job as a cargo loader, and because his dedication and force of will he was promoted to the manager of STIVA.  For 20 years he earned a monthly sum of 25,000MT, but when he was advised of his retirement he immediately constructed a stand in his home.\r\n\r\nToday he is retired and earns a monthly sum of 8,500MT which does not satisfy his necessities.  During a conversation with his wife, who is our client, he learned of our services and solicited a loan in the amount of 15,000MT to strengthen his business.  The impact of his activity is notorious.  He provides basic products to the community reducing the distances people previously covered in search for the same service.\r\n\r\nHe travels one time each week, and he is the only one with a stand and also because he has transportation.  He has earned 2,500MT and is able to save 1,000MT, and that has helped in the critical moments of his business.  Besides his children he is not responsible for anyone else.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The 15,000MT will be used to increase the volume of his business.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan before the due date and request another loan to begin raising chickens.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

The 4 younger ones are attending school.\r\n\r\nAfter getting married, Helena left Manica with her husband who resided in the capital city of Maputo at the time. At the beginning of her life there, she used to spend a long time on her own because her husband was a truck driver. She then started a business selling Pastel ( a typical deep fried treat), a trade she learned from her mother during her childhood. Years later, her husband bought a plot of land in the city of Namaacha in the Swaziland boarder and built the house where they now live. \r\n\r\nNowadays, she is the owner of a snack bar located inside the Namaacha secondary school. She works from 4 am to 10 pm, time when the night classes end. She is helped by two employees who earn 1.500,00 MT each. Her best selling items are pastel, chamussas and cakes. She makes them to order, for baptisms, weddings and birthday parties.

He was born and raised in Inhambane. He's married and a father of 6 children between the ages of 8 and 25 years old. His eldest son works in the neighboring country of South Africa, his second one is a sophomore in college and the younger children are attending school.\r\n\r\nAfter getting a teaching degree, Jo\u00e3o left Inhambane and headed to the capital city of Maputo with his uncle to work in the neighboring village of Namaacha, on the boarder of Swaziland. After arriving there, he got a job teaching the Portuguese Language, position that he held for 4 years before being transferred to work in the Regional Education Department as Production of School Meals technician. He is a permanent employee and makes a net income of 4.500,00MT. He isn't able to save any money due to the high cost of living in his area. \r\n\r\nJo\u00e3o currently lives with his family in a house that was provided to them by the social services. He is building his own house with a loan he received from BIM in the amount of 16.000,00MT. He paid that loan over the course of two years, but the amount borrowed was not enough to conclude the work due to the high cost of materials in the area. He then approached Hluvuku and Kiva, requesting a loan in order to finish his house. Besides taking care of his family, Jo\u00e3o is also responsible for his nephew, who is an orphan and lives in Inhamane. He sends him groceries, which costs him 500,00MT annually.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with Hluvuku and the second with Kiva. His first two loans were used to buy construction material to continue building his home and the third one is going to be used for the same purpose. He is confident he will be able to pay back before the due date and he intends to request a new loan in the future in order to set up water and electric services in his new home.<br

N. was born in Changalane, a community 38 km from the town of Namaacha. She is 40 years old and has three children between the ages of 5 and 18. All of them are still in school.\r\n\r\nMarta started her own business after her father-in-law's death. He owned a large store 7 km from Namaacha in Macuacua. Because she was the only daughter-in-law who was legally married, it was left to her to care. Her husband owned a tractor and worked on small farms to earn money to help his wife with her business. Years later there was a family dispute over the distribution of the deceased's assets, and she was on the verge of bankruptcy. A cousin told our client about our services, and she came to us to request a loan in the amount of 10,000 meticals to improve her business. She has been successful. Because of her store's location near the border with Swaziland, most consumers do their shopping in the neighboring country. She travels once a month and has the best products (sugar, rice, and beverages). She makes 4000 meticals profit each month and saves 1000 meticals, since she has the help of two employees and of her husband, who raises cattle and owns 32 head. In addition to her children, Marta takes care of her mother, sending her 1000 meticals every three months.\r\n\r\nThis is Marta's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. She used to first to improve her business, since she was near bankruptcy. This 20,000 metical loan will be used to increase the volume of her stock. She is confident that she will pay off the loan early and request a new one to continue expanding her business and start selling wholesale.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea

She is 43 years old and lives with her common-law husband. She has five children between the ages of 13 and 25. They are all in school except the middle daughter, who is already employed in education.\r\n\r\nMafalda and her father left Gaza for the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland while she was still a child. Her father worked at the Montemor mineral water company, and died on the job. The company then hired one of his children, and since she was the eldest she had the opportunity to work to help support her family. Today she has been an employee there for 24 years, alternating between a day shift from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and a night shift from 3:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. She earns 2129 meticals a month, not enough to cover her basic expenses, since she lives in a rental house that costs 500 meticals a month. But with the help of her husband, who works as a border guard, they manage to scrape by. Because of the high cost of construction materials they have not been able to finish building their house. Her husband had to apply for a 34,000-metical loan from a bank (BIM) to continue the work, and it still remains unfinished. She learned about our services in a conversation with coworkers, and came to us to request a loan of 10,000 meticals to finish part of the house and be able to move into their own home. Apart from her children, she is not financially responsible for anybody else. She has big dreams of getting married officially and being\r\n\r\nThis is Mafalda's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. She will use these 10,000 meticals to buy door frames and windows and their respective locks. She's very happy, since soon she will be living in her own home. She's confident that she will pay off the loan early and request another one to pay for preparations for her future wedding.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

His partner and two-year-old daughter live with him in his house.\r\n\r\nAnt\u00f3nio only attended school through the fourth grade and had to leave school because of the war that rocked the region. He worked in his uncle's house for five years but had to leave that job because of his poor health, which prevented him from doing heavy labor. With the money he had earned while working with his uncle, he purchased a freezer and started selling frozen products such as ice, chicken, and fish. When his freezer broke, he emigrated to South Africa in an attempt to find a good job and buy a new freezer. He returned home three months later when he learned that his eldest son had died, and decided to stay close to his family. But the money he had brought back wasn't enough to start a good business. He approached Hluvuku requesting a loan of 7000 meticals, which he paid off without any problems. Today he owns a shop in Impaputo and travels twice a month, spending 7000 meticals on each trip and making a profit of 4000 meticals a month. In addition to his daughter, he takes care of his mother, who lives with him in his house.\r\n\r\nThis is Ant\u00f3nio's second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first 7000 meticals were used to buy products to start his business, and these 15,000 meticals will be used to increase his stock of products. He's confident he will repay the loan early and request a new one in order to continue to expand his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":353546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase stock in his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ant\u00f3nio Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":791.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":826.94},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":864.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":903.4},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":944.24},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":986.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1031.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1078.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1126.91},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1177.85},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1231.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1286.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1344.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1405.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.33,"local_amount":791.18,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":814.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63191074,"comment":null},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":826.94,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":851.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618940,"comment":null},{"amount":33.13,"local_amount":864.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":889.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056778,"comment":null},{"amount":34.63,"local_amount":903.4,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":929.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971729,"comment":null},{"amount":100.21,"local_amount":2614.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2690.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816685,"comment":null},{"amount":13.36,"local_amount":348.55,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":358.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118101509,"comment":null},{"amount":331.64,"local_amount":8651.45,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8904.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937833,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-18T20:50:31Z","paid_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122570,"name":"Ghaleb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ghaleb is 44 years old and married with three sons.

After they arrived he is able to finish 10th garde. Years later she was able to get a job with OTM (Mozambique Workers Organization) as a servant where she worked for 2 years, her monthly salary was 150MT which didn't satisfy her necessities at home as she was living alone and paying her rent. She found a job with the Center of Education for Teachers of Primary School (CFPPN), where she works from 6:30am to 2:30pm with a salary of 1.800MT a month. Her husband works in education too and was able to benefit from the distribution of land but they don't have money to start building, this is why they came to Hluvuku to request a loan to start the construction that stopped because of the high cost of construction materials, thanks to Hluvuku and Kiva she wants to use the loan to continue with the construction. Besides her two children, Elisabete supports her mom who lives in Inhambane, she sends her 1,000MT a month.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva, this third loan for 25,000MT will be used to continue building her house. She is confident she will pay on time and will request another loan for energy and paint for the house\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":936.05,"image":{"id":353552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-08-17T05:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.95,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisabete Jacinto ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1356.48},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1412.23},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1470.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1530.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1593.59},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1659.08},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1727.26},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1798.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1872.15},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1949.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2029.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2112.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2199.39},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2289.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.64},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.07},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":2768.71,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2824.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618941,"comment":null},{"amount":55.87,"local_amount":1470.27,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056779,"comment":null},{"amount":58.17,"local_amount":1530.69,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1561.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971730,"comment":null},{"amount":215.54,"local_amount":5672.1,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5787.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816686,"comment":null},{"amount":226.54,"local_amount":5961.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6082.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937834,"comment":null},{"amount":84.31,"local_amount":2218.73,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-21T07:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2263.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937835,"comment":null},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":2286.66,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-16T08:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2333.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.35,"payment_id":128971882,"comment":null},{"amount":87.8,"local_amount":2436.48,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2485.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.79,"payment_id":136698502,"comment":null},{"amount":23.07,"local_amount":654.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":668.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.81,"payment_id":151915910,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T10:25:35Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122576,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel N. is a 31-year-old married man, blessed with two children.

She is married and has 8 children between the ages of 25 and 45, all of them married.\r\n\r\nMaria left Inhambane for Naamacha, a neighboring village on the boarder of Swaziland, with her husband who was a police officer in Macuacua, a town 7km from the village.\r\n\r\nMaria started her own business raising guinea fowls and selling them at the village. She was able to buy a car with the funds she raised and the help of her husband. Having a vehicle to work with, allowed them to expand their business and start selling charcoal in the capital city of Maputo.\r\n\r\nBut, due to the war, Maria lost all her assets and moved back to her village, where she continued her business, with difficulty. After having a conversation with her son who was already a member, she requested a loan to rebuild her business selling chickens.  She is very grateful to Hluvuku and Kiva for having provided her with the amount she requested. She was able to buy 5x100 crates of chicks at 28.000,00MT and resell each bird at 100,00MT, having a profit of 8.000,00MT. She is able to save 2.000,00MT a month because she has to support her grandchildren who are attending school.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria's third loan with Hluvuku and her second loan with Kiva. The 20.000,00MT that she is requesting will be used to grow her businesses. She is confident that she'll be able to pay her loan back without any problems and later on request a new loan, because besides having her business she can also count on her husband's help.<br

Now she lives with her youngest child, who is married, and her three grandchildren, who all go to school.  <P>\r\n\r\nLorta began her school studies very late, due to a lack of means.  Her father abandoned her when she was an infant, leaving her with her mother, a simple farmer.  He said that he was going to work in neighboring South Africa and has never returned to this day.  At age 15 Lorta began her studies and made it through second grade in the old educational system.  Then she became pregnant and stopped her studies, having to take care of her three children, who later lost their lives in wartime.  Lorta was quite hopeless after the death of her children, and was invited to live with her sister invited in Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland.  After she arrived there, Lorta worked as a domestic worker for five years.  With the money she saved, she began her own business.  She built her own house with the earnings from her business.  But the expenses for her child's wedding left her almost bankrupt, and she requested a loan from Hluvuku (Kiva's Field Partner) for 8,000 <em>meticais<\/em> (MT) to bolster the value of her business.  She very successfully repaid the loan.  This current loan of 10,000 MT will be used to increase the volume of stock for her business, for which she travels once a week.  She sells twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, at the informal market, Shoprite, where there is an exchange of products coming from other countries and she makes a profit of 5,000 MT.  Lorta takes care of her mother, who lives with her in her house, and also is able to save 1,000 MT per month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Lorta's second loan from Hluvuku and the first with Kiva.  The first 8,000 MT were used to strengthen her business, and these 10,000 MT will be used to increase the volume of her inventory.  She is confident that she will repay the loan early and will ask for another loan to finish the house of her only child.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

She is divorced and has 5 children between the ages of 9 and 27. The three youngest are still in school.\r\n\r\nAfter her father's death, Luisa had to leave school and make room for younger siblings. A year later, with her uncle's help she was admitted to a teacher training program, where she met her husband. She works in the local schools as a Portuguese teacher. Her husband left her and remarried, but she didn't have economic difficulties because he sent her some money every month to help with the children. Luisa works from 6 a.m. to noon as a teacher, earning 2977 meticals a month, and in the afternoons as a an aide for the FRELIMO party, where she earns 3010 meticals a month. She is unable to save any money because in addition to her children, Luisa also takes care of her mother, sending her 500 meticals a month. She needs to make repairs on her house, since the doors were badly damaged by the constant rain that fell a few months back.\r\n\r\nThis is Luisa's third loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. She will use the 15,000 meticals to pay for the veranda and repairing the doors. She is confident that she will pay off her loan early and request a new one so she can repaint the house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

She is 43 years old and lives with her common-law husband. She has five children between the ages of 13 and 25. They are all in school except the middle daughter, who is already employed in education.\r\n\r\nMafalda and her father left Gaza for the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland while she was still a child. Her father worked at the Montemor mineral water company, and died on the job. The company then hired one of his children, and since she was the eldest she had the opportunity to work to help support her family. Today she has been an employee there for 24 years, alternating between a day shift from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and a night shift from 3:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. She earns 2129 meticals a month, not enough to cover her basic expenses, since she lives in a rental house that costs 500 meticals a month. But with the help of her husband, who works as a border guard, they manage to scrape by. Because of the high cost of construction materials they have not been able to finish building their house. Her husband had to apply for a 34,000-metical loan from a bank (BIM) to continue the work, and it still remains unfinished. She learned about our services in a conversation with coworkers, and came to us to request a loan of 10,000 meticals to finish part of the house and be able to move into their own home.
