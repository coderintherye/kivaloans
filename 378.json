She owns a business venture doing laundry  Sera has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sera needs a loan of WST $2000.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSera joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sera's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 35 and married with 6 children (ages 3 - 19).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling farm-raised fish .  Pesi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Pesi needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional fish to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pesi joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Pesi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Pesi A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

following social metrics for Leaosavaii S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.65 out of 3\r\n\r\nLeaosavaii S. is 28 and married with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Leaosavaii has 2 years of experience in this business.  Leaosavaii needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leaosavaii joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Leaosavaii's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Emeritiana joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Emeritiana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is from the village of Upper Loboc. She is 50 years old. Lolita is married and has an adult child. To make a living, Lolita owns and operates a \"lechon\" (roasted pig) business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing \"lechon\" to local community members. Lolita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 15,000 Philippine pesos a month for this activity. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lolita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lolita has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC, a Kiva partner. \r\n\r\nLolita is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Lolita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n \r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":515408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Some believe that success is luck, a lucky fate and something prescribed, a phenomenon which is not in the person's power. Another group of people believes that though you cannot escape from fate however the fate itself gives us a choice in how we want to live. And our success depends on actual efforts and diligence rather than luck. This is the opinion which belongs to the characters of our story. Nurbubu M. is a leader of this group. Nurbubu has three children. Her oldest daughter is married. Her middle son is in his sophomore year in the Agrarian university, and her youngest daughter goes to secondary school. The conditions in the village are very difficult considering unemployment and a mass exodus of the population into the cities. But Nurbubu and her husband still tried to find happiness in their homeland. They bought a cow, fed it and resold for ten thousand soms ($200US). The used this money to buy cattle, but this time sheep and since then it has become their main business. Reselling of the cattle has allowed them to send their daughter to study in Bishkek and to prepare her dowry later on. At this time their income is around five thousand soms ($130) a month. Her husband is a member of the farmer's union and is actively helping Nurbubu to take care of the cattle. Right now Nurbubu needs a loan to buy four rams for feeding.\r\n\r\nNurbubu has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nEdil A.-U. is 21 years old. He is married. His wife works as a teacher. Edil has a son who is only ten months old. Edil works as a head inspector in the regional architectural association. He has decided to ask for a loan to buy GSM (fuel and oil for machinery) for agricultural work.\r\n\r\nNurisa M. is thirty years old. Nurisa's husband is a member of the farmer's union. Nurisa is raising three children. Nurisa's parents-in-law also live together with her family. Her daughter is in third grade and middle son is in the second grade, her youngest daughter is staying at home. Nurisa works as a nurse. She needs a loan to buy a washing machine.\r\n\r\nNurzada K. is thirty one years old. Nurzada has two children. Her oldest son goes to school. Her mother-in-law also lives with Nurzada. To feed the entire family Nurzada sells GSM (fuel and oil for machinery equipment) and her husband is in farming. Nurzada has started selling with a loan which she received a year and a half ago. Right now she again needs a loan to buy 100 liters of fuel and oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":515484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy four sheep for feeding and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-27T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nurisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nurzada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":33000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4878},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5111},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5356},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5612},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5881},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6162}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.86},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.86,"local_amount":4878,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5029.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715778,"comment":null},{"amount":116.16,"local_amount":5111,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5269.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748625,"comment":null},{"amount":121.73,"local_amount":5356,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931599,"comment":null},{"amount":127.55,"local_amount":5612,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5786.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670610,"comment":null},{"amount":133.65,"local_amount":5881,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6063.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884261,"comment":null},{"amount":140.05,"local_amount":6162,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6353.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151394,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T05:08:34Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189562,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith, 33 years old, is a mother of two children.

Her husband\u2019s daily routine starts early in the morning, with taking the manure out of the shed, giving water to the cows and milking the cows. As any person living in a village area, she runs a small household and even though they live in the area which is known for its harsh winters, they are perfectly used to local weather conditions. \r\n\r\nAinakul is a mother of three children. All the children go to school. Her eldest son is fifteen. After school, he helps his parents look after the cattle. However, Ainakul tries not to burden her children with anything concerning housework as she believes that her children should be spared of all that to have more free time for studies. Ainakul is forty-five years old and feels herself in sufficiently good health and does not feel tiredness until evening. Now they are feeding a calf which they bought for $230. Ainakul\u2019s dream is to give her children good education, help them get on their feet and improve her family\u2019s living conditions. Her husband is currently a member of a farm and also works as a procurement manager of a high school. Now Ainakul needs a loan to buy four sheep for feeding and resale. \r\n\r\nAinakul\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nBurul S., 57, is the wife of a school worker. She has a sixteen-year-old daughter. Burul is busy with cattle that they keep at home. Burul has applied for this loan to buy more cattle. \r\n\r\nNazgul A., 34, is the wife of a computer science and math teacher. Nazgul has three little children and currently does not work as she has to look after the kids. Now they keep three calves and need a loan to buy some sheep. \r\n\r\nAibek K., 23, is married. His wife goes to college, and Aibek has to provide for both of them. Aibek works at school and wants to start a new business as an additional source of income. He hopes to obtain this loan and buy sheep for feeding.

She and her family live in Tup, which is located on the shores of beautiful Lake Issyk-Kul. Damir is married, fifty years old with two sons. They have cattle, and the children help them to store food. In addition, since the spring the family is also farming. Damir has one milk cow to produce milk and earns extra income from the sale of livestock. For example, last spring, they bought two lambs for a half thousand soms ($35) and resold them for two and a half thousand soms ($55) in the autumn. From a single sale of milk, they are able to earn up to a thousand soms ($22) per month. They have a rather wide range of occupations, which includes agriculture, livestock, and trade. Damir now wants to buy four lambs and one calf for fattening, to then resell in the fall. She hopes to get the loan and to realize her plans. In the future, Damir and her family are planning to increase arable land from five to ten hectares, which in turn should bring them in twice the yield than before. \r\n<p>\r\nDamir\u2019s Partners live in the same village:\r\n<p>\r\nRoza T. is a widow with three sons. Rose has some livestock. Her children help in the summer to procure forage. Since April, Rose plans to sell milk. One of her cows will calve soon. Rose is asking for a loan, to purchase lambs for fattening.\r\n<p>\r\nRapiya B. is a widow and mother of four children. Her son helps her with the business while her daughters study in school. Rapiya\u2019s cows produces six liters of milk. Milk sales earns her a monthly one and a half thousand soms. She is asking for a loan to buy a cow for fattening. \r\n<p>\r\nTologon T. is fifty-four years old with one son. Tologon sells six liters of milk daily and her son is a farm equipment mechanic. Tologon hopes to get a loan with which she plans to purchase cattle, and increase the stock.

Bekishkan\u2019s husband and eldest son, who is twenty-five years old, rent minivans for deliveries. Three years ago, Bekishkan purchased seed potatoes. Bekishkan, along with her children, are growing potatoes for sale. The youngest daughter is in the tenth grade. She and her middle brother, are helping their mother. Their current monthly income from the sale of potatoes is slightly more than two and a half thousand soms ($55). It is a small income, but considering that at the very beginning, three years ago, they invested a total of about two thousand soms ($50) in the purchase of potatoes, as well as the fact that the potato season sales begin in the fall, we can assume that they will make a profit. Now, Bekishkan has plans to further develop her potato business. Bekishkan wants to get a loan and buy potato seed varieties called \"Mundial\", as well as to increase the acreage.\r\n<p> \r\nBekishkan\u2019s Partners for the group:\r\n<p>\r\nKulukan K. is fifty-two years old and her husband is unemployed.

Ten years ago, he was involved in raising cattle, but now for the past ten years, he raises and sells only sheep.

Tucumanas are meat empanadas that are accompanied by a peanut sauce and salad, and rellenos are made of mashed potato and minced meat, also accompanied by a salad. She has worked in this for a year and a half. Her husband has a vehicle, which is currently in a panel beater shop for refurbishment, so he is working as a salaried driver with another vehicle. She has two young children that her sister-in-law watches during the morning, since they both work. She and her husband care for them in the afternoon. They live in their in-laws home and are hard workers. This loan will be invested in the vehicle to pay their balance and reclaim it from the panel beater.

He became an orphan at a young age and was raised by his godmother. Since he was young, he has liked rock music. As he acquired music, he started to see that, with his love of music, he could open a store. Thus, he started to acquire merchandise such as tee shirts, hats, and bracelets with rock group themes. He also started to get music videos of concerts and rock groups of world fame. He also sells Play Station 1, 2 and 3 games and computer games. He could like to have a greater proportion of videos of rock groups from other countries to augment his collection. His job is to get the videos, make a copy on his computer, and sell it to people who like that type of music. With the money from this loan, he will buy merchandise in bulk: tee shirts, hats, CD\u2019s, etc\u2026 He is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust given in granting this loan.<br

He is married to Cecilia and has 4 kids aged 12, 9, 7, and 1. They are going through rough times right now because his youngest child has a disease in both eyes; (congenital cataracts). Sadly, they cant't have the surgery because the doctors told them it is very expensive; ($1,000). At the moment they don't have that kind of money; they only have enough for food and to send the kids to school.\r\n\r\nJavier and his family live in Cochabamba city in the Viloma Grande area. His main activity is construction and his wife works in the production of raw milk  for making cheese. They have a small house with only 2 rooms.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy a head of dairy cattle. This way, the amount of cheese for sale will increase and so will their income. Among his dreams and goals the most important thing is to save money for his youngest son's surgery who is suffering very much with the disease. Also, Mr. Javier wants to build a bigger house with a room for each of the kids, because the one they have is too small.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

Este negocio le ha brindado bastante apoyo durante este tiempo y gracias a el ahora puede responder por su familia.\n\nMartina desea ampliar su negocio con la compra de m\u00e1s pescado, ya que durante estos dias en que se avecina la semana santa, el consumo de pescado es masivo. Por este motivo se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 800 nuevos soles que le ayuden a lograr su objetivo.\n\nMartina es una mujer bastante trabajadora y que actualmente lucha por sacar adelante a su familia, ella no se deja amilanar por la situaci\u00f3n que se encuentra pasando actualmente. Sus vecinos y conocidos la admiran mucho por su determinaci\u00f3n, en la fotograf\u00eda nos muestra las cubetas en la que comercializa su producto.\n\n","en":"Martina is 45 years old, she became a widow recently, and she lives with her three children (two of them are minors). Her house is located in the district of Santa Rosa, a district with an economy mainly supported by fishing. This area is located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nDue to her husband\u2019s illness, she started working three years ago in the fresh fish business at the regional fishing terminal; she buys the fish from the boats that arrive at the terminal and then she sells it to the merchants that go to the terminal to buy the fish and then resell it at the main regional markets. This activity can only be done in the early hours of the morning. This business has provided her with a lot of support in these times and thanks to the business she can provide for her family.\r\n\r\nMartina wishes to expand her business to buy more fish, since Easter is near and fish consumption is massive during this time. For this reason, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternative for 800 Nuevos Soles that will help her reach her objective.\r\n\r\nMartina is a hard-working woman and she is fighting to get ahead in life with her family; she does not allow herself to be scared of her current situation. Her neighbors and acquaintances admire her for her determination. In the picture, she show us the containers she uses to sell her product.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":515622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Buy fresh fish to expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-27T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":72.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":73.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":79.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":86.39},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.4},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.48},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.4,"local_amount":67.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":72.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662373,"comment":null},{"amount":27.18,"local_amount":72.46,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":77.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695076,"comment":null},{"amount":27.48,"local_amount":73.29,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":78.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878121,"comment":null},{"amount":28.4,"local_amount":75.74,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618148,"comment":null},{"amount":29.56,"local_amount":78.82,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832550,"comment":null},{"amount":29.98,"local_amount":79.95,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":85.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099155,"comment":null},{"amount":31.77,"local_amount":84.71,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530018,"comment":null},{"amount":65.79,"local_amount":175.46,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":186.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666174,"comment":null},{"amount":34.44,"local_amount":91.83,"processed_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":97.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409516,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-27T20:58:26Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189639,"name":"Luis Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis Alfredo de 20 A\u00f1os Soltero de Profesi\u00f3n Bachiller en computaci\u00f3n del paraje Xerancho de la Aldea Tunayac, municipio de  Momostenango  departamento de  Totonicap\u00e1n, es una persona responsable que ha trabajado hace mas de 4 a\u00f1os, en diferentes actividades que se organizan dentro de la comunidad, y no han tenido problemas con nadie lo conocen bien en la comunidad  .\nActualmente trabaja en un centro de Internet ubicado en el paraje de Pologu\u00e1 prestando los servicios a la poblaci\u00f3n en general.

She and her husband struggled to acquire their own home.  \r\n<p>\r\nFelipa started her small business because she needed to support her family since her husband receives low wages from his job as a security guard.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Lolita D.'s Group. Lolita is married and has three adult children. She has run a general store for over 27 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lolita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lolita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to broaden her inventory. This loan will be the second one taken out by Lolita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elizabeth E.'s group. Elizabeth is married and has three school-aged children. She has run a general store for the past two years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elizabeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Elizabeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Imang, Brgy San Pablo Cadiz Negros Occidental.  She is married and has 3 adult -aged children. To making a living, Helen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari sari store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Helen has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Helen joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 29,500 Php from NWTF. Helen is now requesting a new loan of 29,500 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the 13th loan taken out by the borrower from NWTF. Helen plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calls of not just of a few, but thousands of women.

He intends to use the loan to buy more motorcycle spare parts since they are in high demand. His wish is to find a lender, through KADET to enable him to further his business.

To make a living, Aurea raises ducks for sale. Aurea has been engaged in her business for over twelve years and earns approximately $150 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nAurea joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aurea is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase ducklings to raise and sell in the future. This will be her 1st loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is 37-year-old Elizabeth P. K. from Mbarali. She is married with six children between the ages of 12 and 20 years. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans.\n\nElizabeth has been running a cloth selling business since 2009. Her business is purchasing clothes wholesale and selling them retail. She works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by her husband. \nElizabeth is requesting a loan of 600,000 Tsh in order to purchase more clothes in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of her clothes. Elizabeth thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more clothes in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189789,"name":"Flor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flor N. is from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin province.

She is applying for another loan in order to expand her activity a little more and to satisfy better her customers.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":516244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of cassava","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Allada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-29T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":8571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653393,"comment":null},{"amount":17.85,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835600,"comment":null},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575997,"comment":null},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954511,"comment":null},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056168,"comment":null},{"amount":17.85,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347703,"comment":null},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.42,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T09:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T13:05:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-22T09:33:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189804,"name":"Tabitha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tabitha, 46 years old and married with seven children, has been farming since 2008.

C. is a 63-year-old woman living in the town of Hacienda Inang, Barangay San Pablo, Manapla, Negros Occidental. She is married and has seven adult children. Cecilia owns and operates a fishing business, harvesting fish from pens she constructed along the shoreline and selling fish in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over forty years and earns approximately PHP 15,000 a month.\n\nIn 2004, Cecilia joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 28,000 from NWTF.\n\nCecilia is now requesting a new loan of PHP 28,000 which will be used to purchase additional fish fry to raise in her fish pens. This loan will be her 13th from NWTF.

The main source of income for this business comes primarily from selling personal products such as glasses, watches, cosmetics, and personal products like lotion and fragrance to members of the local community. Genedina has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month from these activities. In addition to her store, she sells \u2018amakan\u2019 (woven bamboo strips that are used to dry rice under the heat of the sun).\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Genedina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Genedina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nGenedina is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Genedina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a resident of Mahabang Parang, Binangonan, Rizal. She is 38 years old and married. She is seen as strong and determined to improve their standard of living. She is a caring mother of eight children, all of whom need her moral and financial support.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Christina and her husband are busy with a poultry raising business just to earn the means of living every day. When she received a small amount of capital from ASHI, she managed to put it all into her business. For her, business is an important factor, and she does not want to be a problem for her group mates or for the center in terms of paying back of loans weekly.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a new loan amounting PHP 14,000 to have additional working capital for her poultry-raising business. Specifically, the loan fund will be used to pay for chicks, vitamins, feed for the chicks, and other materials for poultry-raising. Christina performs well in her business; when she has enough capital, she expands her business in order to gain more income. \r\n\r\nAlong with the business success she is dreaming about, is the hope to see the graduation of their children from college and to see them find a good job. She is also dreaming of constructing a home made of concrete for comfortable living.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":516347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"The

He lives with his wife and children in the Dougounina quarter in the town of Bougouni (third administrative region of Mali). Never having attended school for social reasons, he began working very early, notably training in mechanics, sheet-metal working, automobile electricity, and welding at a local and respected garage. Eventually, Bakary chose to work with sheet metal over the other options. With ten years of experience, he is often solicited for his business.\r\nWhen researching supplementary financial options, Bakary decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microcredit program. He is on his first loan and counts on using it to buy a large quantity of various materials used in sheet metal work (gum, glue, gas for torching, rods, etc.). Bakary gets his supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and always works in the garage where he learned the business. His clients are diverse and varied. Bakary hopes to make a monthly profit of 35,000 FCFA which will allow him to grow his business and contribute to his family's needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":516388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of various materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961345,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180552,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751833,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360682,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-04T18:31:43Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189899,"name":"Korotoumou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Korotoumou D. est une femme mari\u00e9e de 25 ans et m\u00e8re de 2 enfants qui vit avec ses enfants chez son \u00e9poux dans le quartier H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord de la ville de Bougouni (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion du Mali). \nKorotoumou a abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole d\u00e8s son jeune \u00e2ge, pour se livrer aux activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus en  choisissant finalement le secteur de l\u2019habillement.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy additional wheat flour, maize flour for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Coastal Region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pilly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189919,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose A.

She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nThe subgroup Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 4 consists of the president Ms. Fatoumata T., the treasurer Ms. A\u00efssatou W. (both retailers of clothing fabric), Ms. Rokhaya F. a vendor of vegetables, Ms. Aminata D. who sells smoked fish, and Ms. Ndeye Khady D. who sells dried fish.\r\n\r\nThe president Fatoumata T. has been selling Wax and Basin types of clothing fabric for the past six years. She gets her supplies outside Senegal, from Rosso in Mauritania. From time to time she varies her business by retailing roasted peanuts in her neighborhood in Grand Thi\u00e8s. She is 42 years old, married and the mother of three children aged 13, 8, and 5 years.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":516455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"get supplies of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efssatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Khady ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759326,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790840,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971274,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708549,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922595,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-21T09:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189103,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484533,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620777,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-02T23:18:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189939,"name":"Adinsi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme est une femme mari\u00e9e, elle est m\u00e8re de 5 enfants et vit avec sa famille dans le quartier de B\u00e8 kpota qui est un quartier p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique de la ville de Lom\u00e9.

She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nThe 5th sub-group (Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 5) consists of:\r\n\u2022\tMs. Yacine S., the president of this sub-group, born in 1962. For the past 17 years she has sold dried fish, palm oil and clothing fabrics in the market. She is married and mother of one child aged 26. As she says, she is active because she needs to combat idleness and handle both her needs and those of her family. This loan will allow her to balance her supplies budget;\r\n\u2022\tMs. Mbery D. who retails various products (among which peanuts) to her customers in the market. She has been doing this for five years;\r\n\u2022\tMs. Ngousane N.  who for the past four years has sold fruit in front of the regional hospital of Thies;\r\n\u2022\tMs. Amy T., who has retailed ni\u00e9b\u00e9 (a local bean), millet and peanuts from her home over the past four years; and\r\n\u2022\tMs. Amy D.  who rents chairs and tarpaulins for ceremonies.

It is based in Grand Thies and was created in 1992 by Maty Niakh, who is the current president of the network. The president had this idea after receving a training  from the NGO Oxfam in Thies. She is also trained in group management, business administration, etc. Network members are extremely dedicated and meet once a month. \r\nBeside a membership fee to the group, each member is required to contribute monthly with 200 CFA to a solidarity fund. Wishing to finance themselves, they decided to join U-IMCEC. Thus, their network has splitted into 19 groups of 5 people each, for a better use of funding. They request a second loan of 100 000 FCFA per member, which is 500 000 FCFA per sub-group, to develop their various activities. However, the contributions are paid to the President, assisted by the Treasurer of the group, Ms. Seck Coumba during their monthly meetings and they are responsible to refund U-IMCEC. The network, accordng to the president, has only one noble goal: to fight family poverty. The network currently has 19 subgroups, each with a chairman and a treasurer. F.C. No. 6, is chaired by Mrs. Bousso D., who is 43 years of age and mother of 7 children; she has been selling vegetables, peanuts, dried fish and palm oil for five years . The Treasurer is Mrs. C. Moussou, who has been selling palm oil and dried fish for four years at the market place in Thies. The other members are Ms. Oumy G., who sells rice, millet and oil, Ms. Soda L., who sells fresh fish and Ms. Coumba F. who sells vegetables.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by MONICA URBAN, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":516478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bousso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759328,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790842,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971276,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-22T09:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708551,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922597,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189105,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484535,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-31T03:22:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189950,"name":"Chrispine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chrispine has a tailoring business in Kariokor, a very busy estate and market in Nairobi near the city center.

It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Mrs. Maty Niakh, the current president of the network. She had this idea following a training course she was given by the charitable organisation, OXFAM, in Thi\u00e8s. She is familiar with managing a group, entrepreneurship etc. The members of the network are extremeL. committed and meet up once a month. On top of the group membership fees they have to pay, each member is  obliged to make a monthL. contribution of 200 FCFA to a solidarity fund. As they wanted to be able to finance themselves, they decided to join to U-IMCEC (a S\u00e9n\u00e9galese association of mutual savings and loans institutions).  AccordingL., their network was divided into 19 sub-groups of five members each, in order to take greater advantage of funding. They are requesting a second loan of 100,000 FCFA for each member, that is 500,000 FCFA per sub-group in order to develop their various activities. \r\n\r\nThe payments are made to the president assisted by the treasurer of the group, Mrs. Coumba Seck, during their monthL. meetings, and these two women take on the responsbility in turn to repay U-IMCEC. This network has, according to the president, just one noble objective: to fight poverty among households. CurrentL., it comprises 19 sub-groups, each with their own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe sub-group Femmes Commer\u00e7antes No. 7 is managed by Mrs. Aminata D\u00e8me, who is 33 years old.

Ainsi, apr\u00e8s des frais d\u2019adh\u00e9sion au groupement, chaque membre est tenu de cotiser mensuellement 200 FCFA pour une caisse de solidarit\u00e9.\nSouhaitant se financer, elles d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent  d\u2019adh\u00e9rer \u00e0  U-IMCEC. C\u2019est ainsi que,  leur r\u00e9seau se voit scinder en 19 sous groupes de 5 personnes  pour un meilleur profit des financements. Elles sollicitent pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois un pr\u00eat de 100 000 FCFA par membre,  soit 500 000 FCFA par sous groupe afin de d\u00e9velopper leurs diverses activit\u00e9s.\nCependant, les r\u00e8glements sont vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente assist\u00e9e par la tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re du groupe, Madame Coumba S., pendant leurs r\u00e9unions mensuelles et ces deux se chargent \u00e0 leur tour de rembourser U-IMCEC. Ce r\u00e9seau qui, dit la pr\u00e9sidente, n\u2019a qu\u2019un seul et noble objectif : combattre la pauvret\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9nages. Actuellement, le r\u00e9seau compte 19 sous groupes avec chacun une pr\u00e9sidente et une tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re.\nCependant Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b08 est sous la responsabilit\u00e9 de Madame  Khady F..

Elle est c\u00e9libataire et m\u00e8re d'un seul enfant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 20 ans \u00e0 ce jour. Cependant Madame Khady F. admet avoir pris en charge les besoins de son enfant avec ses profits du commerce. Elle partage ce sous groupe Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b08 avec Madame Rokhaya N., 53 ans et vendeuse de poissons s\u00e9ch\u00e9s, Madame Fatou N. vendeuse de glace et de jus locaux, Madame Oumy M. qui fait le commerce ambulant de produits cosm\u00e9tiques et de Madame Sokhna Aminata S.  qui vend elle aussi du parfum, et thiouraye (encens).","en":"As its name suggests, Femmes Commer\u00e7antes is a network of businesswomen. It is based at Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, its current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba S.. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nFemmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 8 falls under the responsibility of Mrs. Khady F.. She is 42 years old and runs a shop named \u201cMaison B\u00e9b\u00e9\u201d (Baby House). She has been selling baby clothes for 15 years. She is unmarried and the mother of one child aged 20. She acknowledges that is the earnings from her commerce that enabled her to take care of her child. She is joined in the Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 8 group by Mrs. Rokhaya N., a 53-year-old vendor of dried fish; Mrs. Fatou N., vendor of ice cream and local fruit juices; Mrs. Oumy M., an itinerant vendor of beauty products; and  Mrs. Sokhna Aminata S., who also sells perfume and thiouraye (incense).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":516500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Resupply merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-03T07:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759330,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790844,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971278,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708553,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922599,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-21T09:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189107,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484537,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620781,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-10T16:08:40Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189967,"name":"Resty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Resty is a single mother of one child and her child goes to school.

This is 70-year-old Maria Landi P. from Morogoro. She is widowed with five children between the ages of 12 and 25.\n\nMaria has been running a milk business since 2008. Selling milk is a common business for Tanzanian women, especially Masai women. (the Masai are a tribe found in the northern part of Tanzania). Masai people do not cultivate farms but they own large numbers of cows, goats and sheep. One person can have more than one hundred cows and more than two hundred goats.\n\nThey sell their milk in order to get money so that they can buy other food such as maize and beans and to meet other expenses. The milk business is a very successful business because milk is in high demand by many people. Milk contains all the necessary ingredients and vitamins needed for health.\n\nMaria works at her business for 5 to 8 hours per day, 3 days per week, and is assisted by her children. She is requesting a loan of 300,000 Tsh in order to purchase cups, bowls and baskets for her business. In the future, she plans to provide more litres of milk for her customers. Maria thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase cups, bowls, baskets and other vessels  for carrying milk as well as animal feeder .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189973,"name":"Beverly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beverly C. is from the village of North Poblacion, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province.

This is 35-year-old Wastalah Abdala K. from Morogoro. She is divorced with four children between the ages of 1 and 18.\r\n\r\nWastalah has been running a mama lishe since 2008. A mama lishe (local restaurant or caf\u00e9) in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour) and plantain (cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\r\n\r\nWastalah works at her business for 5 to 8 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by two employees. She is requesting a loan of 200,000 TZS in order to purchase additional wheat flour, maize flour, plates and cups.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Wastalah plans to do maintenance work on her buildings and to open another business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional wheat flour, maize flour, plates and cups","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wastalah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189985,"name":"Eduardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eduardo B. is from Murry Village, Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

This is 22-year-old Agness Adolf E. from Morogoro. She is married with two children aged 2 and 5. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans. Agness has been running a used-clothing sales business since 2008. \n\nSecond-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern.\n\nAgness works at her business for 5 to 8 hours per day, 5 to 8 days per week and is assisted by five people. She is requesting a loan of 250,000 TSH in order to purchase more clothes for her business.\n\nIn the future, Agness plans to increase the quantity of her stock. She thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more clothes for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":20833.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189988,"name":"Akuvi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akuvi D. is a trained seamstress.

Monica has a business selling groceries from her house.  At times she also knits sweaters.  This loan will be invested in the purchase of rice and sugar.  Monica dreams of having a stable with milk cows.\r\n\r\nThe members need loans of various amounts such as 200, 300 or 600 Peruvian soles, making a total of 5,900 soles of loans to the communal bank.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She lives in the Rumiloma community, found 10 minutes outside of the city of Cuenca, whose primary business is that of farming and raising cattle - but the younger people look to the city for new and better opportunties.  Our member is 64 years old, and has been widowed for 13 years.  Her late husband drank in excess. She had 6 children who are 42, 38, 36, 31, 27,  and 23 years old.  Her first four children are married and live on their own with their families.  Her two single children live with her, but don't help her with the household expenses.  She feels very proud to have built her home, which although small, is her own. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Jes\u00fas works selling fruits and vegetables.  From the young age of 10, she began this work, working 5 days a week from 8 am - 6 pm, or until she's sold out of her products.  She has Tuesdays and Thursdays off.    \r\n\r\nShe is now in her 4th cycle with the foundation (ESPOIR) and the with loans she's received, she's invested in products to supply her business.  With this new loan, she is going to buy apples, oranges, naranjillas (a citrus fruit from Ecuador), grapes, carrots, beets, among other fruits and vegetables, to supply her fruit stand to offer to her clients, since these scarce products are very expensive due to the the drought that has occurred in this region.  Her dream is to remain in good health so that she can continue working in her fruit and vegetable stand which is her daily livelihood.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kimberly Baker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":516527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy apples, oranges, naranjillas, grapes, chard, carrots, beets, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-31T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.25,"local_amount":99,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":101.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674825,"comment":null},{"amount":198.74,"local_amount":194.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":198.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709005,"comment":null},{"amount":224.99,"local_amount":219.99,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":224.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892302,"comment":null},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632677,"comment":null},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846732,"comment":null},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":73.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113252,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-03T15:48:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190011,"name":"Sophie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophie is married with one child and her child goes to school.

H. is from the village of Casinglot, Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental. She is 32 years-old and married with four school-aged children. Julieta owns and operates a sari-sari (general) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Julieta has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Julieta joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julieta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Julieta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Julieta from HSPFI.
