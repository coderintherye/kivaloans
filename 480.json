Many times, the companies he transports for do not pay him until weeks after the completed transport, so Leslie has to front the gas payments. \r\n\r\nLeslie loves his business because he gets to travel and see new places all the time. Leslie says, \u201cIn one week I can go fly-fishing in Colorado and deep-sea fishing in Victoria, Texas\u201d. His ultimate goal is to buy a piece of property in Colorado where he can take groups of people fly-fishing in the summer time and hunting in the winter time. Furthermore, with one child as a sophomore at Texas Tech and the other a senior in high school, Leslie\u2019s goal is to put both of them through college. \r\n\r\nLeslie says, \"Organizations like ACCION can help people like me who do not have a credit history. I've always believed that if you don't have the money for it, you don't need it.  But that's not always the smartest thinking when you have a business. A microloan is a great and only option for folks like me.\"

She has a small grocery store and sells seafood together with her husband. \r\n\r\nShe began 10 years ago selling seafood with her husband. Since this generated a good income, she decided to invest part of their earnings in groceries, so she could set up a small store outside her house, in a little shop she built, and thus spend more time with her children. Little by little, with effort, she was able to stock her store with rice, soft drinks and sweets. Currently, she works from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in her store, while her husband goes out to sell seafood. Although the seafood sales generate more earnings, she wants to continue with her store, because it gives her more time for her children and grandchildren. \r\n\r\nTo stock her store with more goods, she would like to use the loan to buy clothing, so she can sell it to her neighbors and thus earn additional income. She would also like to buy seafood and rice for her store. In the future, she would like to have a seafood restaurant next to her store, so she can expand it even more. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":622527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying clothing and seafood to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Playas (Villamil)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-10-22T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Clementina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72.05},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":77.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81.35},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89.53},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":97.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.05},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.35},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.77},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.53},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.05,"local_amount":72.05,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":72.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544477,"comment":null},{"amount":75.16,"local_amount":75.16,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":75.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188681233,"comment":null},{"amount":76.21,"local_amount":76.21,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":76.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379555,"comment":null},{"amount":77.98,"local_amount":77.98,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":77.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797546,"comment":null},{"amount":81.35,"local_amount":81.35,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239702,"comment":null},{"amount":81.67,"local_amount":81.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-18T07:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206106144,"comment":null},{"amount":83.97,"local_amount":83.97,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862900,"comment":null},{"amount":85.51,"local_amount":85.51,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":85.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216459382,"comment":null},{"amount":87.77,"local_amount":87.77,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221623233,"comment":null},{"amount":89.53,"local_amount":89.53,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-30T07:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":89.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226992501,"comment":null},{"amount":188.8,"local_amount":188.8,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-27T07:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":188.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751610,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-24T02:42:55Z","paid_date":"2011-10-27T07:46:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":240626,"name":"Alma Nuvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alma Nuvia tiene 53 a\u00f1os y tiene 4 hijo todos son mayores de edad e independientes.

R. es una mujer de 50 a\u00f1os que vive en el barrio Siape y que no se queda quieta porque le da curso a su talento emprendedor; siempre est\u00e1 en funci\u00f3n de mirar las oportunidades, comprar, vender  y conocer nuevas personas para convertirlas en sus clientes.\nAs\u00ed ha venido trabajando durante muchos a\u00f1os,  porque desde hace 7,  se dedica a viajar Maicao,  un municipio fronterizo con Venezuela,  para  comprar  v\u00edveres como arroz, aceite,  fab, Jab\u00f3n, leche en polvo, salchicha, refrescos y hasta sabanas.  Cuando inici\u00f3 esta actividad, lo hizo con muy escaso capital y poco a poco ha ido increment\u00e1ndolo. Duve viaja con su hermana cada 8 d\u00edas, compra productos que le encargan y los distribuye a cr\u00e9dito  semanalmente, para luego recoger su cartera cada quince; sus principales clientes son sus vecinos del barrio San Salvador  y tambi\u00e9n tiene en su propia comunidad. \u00daltimamente ha encontrado  muchos de estos art\u00edculos a buen precio en Barranquilla y entonces los compra en esa ciudad. Duve  adicion\u00f3 a su negocio la venta de  calzado a trav\u00e9s de gu\u00edas especializadas y este dinero lo recoge cada quince d\u00edas y vende por encargos.\nDuve es una mujer  muy creativa y din\u00e1mica, siempre est\u00e1 en movimiento, le saca mucho provecho a sus capacidades y constantemente permanece identificando nichos de mercado donde pueda ella ganar con su trabajo; se ha dedicado siempre a lo que le gusta y ah\u00ed radica su \u00e9xito. En \u00e9poca de carnavales, Duve vende camisetas estampadas con lentejuelas que ella misma decora y este es un potencial al cual le saca dinero tambi\u00e9n, igualmente vende cerveza, sopas y hayacas, ya que aprovecha que en el sector donde vive es justamente por donde se dan los grandes desfiles del carnaval, comparsas  y es  un escenario  de gran aglomeraci\u00f3n de personas para disfrutar de estos eventos importantes en la ciudad de Barranquilla. Ella y su familia  conformada por su esposo, pensionado de una empresa, e hijos y nietos, viven en su propia casa  donde ella y su esposo permanecen  siempre unidos  y en todas las decisiones de su hogar. Este es su tercer financiamiento y Duve planea comprar v\u00edveres, en un mayor volumen porque tiene encargado, arroz, aceite, fab, jab\u00f3n, leche en polvo embutidos; ella siente que ha cambiado su vida desde que recibi\u00f3 su primer cr\u00e9dito,  porque ha tenido la posibilidad de dinero   disponible para comprar y responder  muy pronto a sus clientes. Su sue\u00f1o es ampliarlo  adicion\u00e1ndole prendas de plata porque tiene un potencial de clientes  que conoci\u00f3 en Maicao y as\u00ed se lo han solicitado, este es justamente su desaf\u00edo,  pues requiere un poco mas de capital y est\u00e1 trabajando para ello\n\n\n\n","en":"Duve M. R. is a 50-year-old woman who lives in the Siape neighborhood, and who does not just sit around, because she is giving expression to her entrepreneurial talent: she is always busy looking for opportunities, buying, selling, and getting to know new people in order to make them her customers.\r\n\r\nShe has been working in this way for many years; 7 years ago, she started traveling to Maicao, a municipality on the border with Venezuela, to buy groceries such as rice, oil, detergent, soap, powdered milk, sausages, soft drinks and even bedsheets. When she began this business, she did it with very little capital, and little by little she has been increasing it. Duve travels with her sister every 8 days, buying products which her customers request, and distributing them on credit each week; she later collects her payments every two weeks. Her main customers are her neighbors in the San Salvador neighborhood and also in her own community. Recently, she has found many of these items for a good price in Barranquilla, and thus she buys them in that city. Duve added to her business the sale of shoes through specialized guides; she sells them on order and collects the money every 15 days. \r\n\r\nDuve is a very creative and dynamic woman who is always on the move. She takes great advantage of her skills, and she is constantly identifying market niches where she can earn money with her work. She has always done what she enjoys, and that is the root of her success. During the Carnival season, Duve sells shirts decorated with sequins, which she makes herself, and this is another source of income for her. She also sells beer, soup and hayacas [a kind of tamale], taking advantage of the fact that the area where she lives happens to be the place where the great Carnival parades take place, so it is a place where great crowds gather to enjoy these events that are so important for the city of Barranquilla. She and her family, made up of her husband, who is retired from work with a company, along with children and grandchildren, live in their own house, where she and her husband always remain united in all of the decisions related to the household. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan, and Duve plans to buy groceries in greater volume, because she has orders for rice, oil, detergent, soap, powdered milk, and sausages. She feels that her life has changed since she received her first loan, because she has had the opportunity to have money available to buy merchandise and respond very quickly to her customers. Her dream is to expand her business, adding silver jewelry, because she has potential customers she met in Maicao, and they have requested this. This is her current challenge, since she needs a little more capital, and she is working toward this goal.

At first when her husband stopped working as an employee they set up a business in which they offered washing machine and video game rental services, but the competition that was generated in this community related to these types of businesses was stiff.

Peregrina learned how to farm as a young child but her work now involves mostly small livestock. She raises sheep and guinea pigs, which she finds to be a profitable business. It provides her with income in the time before she can harvest her maize crop. Growing maize requires time and a lot of work from Peregrina and her family. Also, some seasons are affected by bad weather and other factors that can result in the loss of all her investments of time and money. Nevertheless, these challenges don't discourage Peregrina because farming is her way of life. \r\n\r\nFor now, Peregrina's greatest hope is to improve her maize harvest and expand her livestock business.

One of his main needs is the need to purchase more sheep in order to improve his business. For this reason Agamammad has applied for a loan of 1000 AZN to purchase 20 sheep. Previously, he took a loan from AqroInvest through KIVA and he has successfully finished it.

\"Eddie\" A. started taking apart televisions and putting them back together when he was 9 years old. He naturally gravitated toward mechanics and eventually worked as a manager at several high-end auto corporations in San Antonio. Without ever spending a day in college, Eddie successfully managed these stores and participated in several auto training courses that led him to become an expert in auto electronics, auto body repair, and mechanics. Even though he liked working for these corporations, he could not overcome the fact that he could spend his whole life working for this business and be fired at any point. However, Eddie\u2019s most significant motivation to start his own business was to be able to spend more time with his wife and two children and have guaranteed days off. \n\nIn 1999, he used his savings and opened his business, Audio Express, which focuses on audio, video and security systems in automobiles. The first year was incredibly rough because his store was robbed of all its inventory. He was very close to closing down but was able to persevere through the difficult time. However, his business was in a bad location and with his first ACCION Texas-Louisiana loan, he moved to his current location. With this shift, his business doubled and he is convinced that without this first ACCION loan, he would be out of business, \u201cThe microloan enabled us to take our store to another level. We could transition to another location and get more business.\u201d\n\nEddie accounts his success to his \u201c3 P\u201d rule that he always abides by: \u201cPeople, product and price.\u201d He always focuses on the customers\u2019 needs first. Even when gas was $4 a gallon, Audio Express did well because of the customer-first focus. When people from the Louisiana coast line evacuated to San Antonio during Hurricane Katrina, Eddie contributed to this cause by repairing their vehicles for free. He even repaired a Saints football player\u2019s car free of charge and did not know who he was until #93 came back with free tickets.  \n\nTo prepare for the holiday season, Eddie plans on buying basic inventory with his loan: stereos, radios, and amplifiers. He says, \u201cIf we don\u2019t have it, we can\u2019t sell it\u201d. What\u2019s next for Eddie? He is going to pursue marketing his incredibly innovative invention that he cannot disclose at this time. \n

Today, her hope is to expand her business, adding working capital whenever she can, looking for new clients, and most of all, keeping it profitable and providing and effective service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":622692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To invest it in a line of perfumes and cosmetics, which are the products that pick up in sales at the end of the year.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-23T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97031},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":114224},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":116413},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118644},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":120918},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":123236},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125598},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":128005},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":130459},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":132959},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":135508},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":157005}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.73},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.53},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.79},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.98,"local_amount":97031,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":99406,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688409,"comment":null},{"amount":64.73,"local_amount":114224,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":117019.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427625,"comment":null},{"amount":65.97,"local_amount":116413,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":119262.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001044,"comment":null},{"amount":67.23,"local_amount":118644,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":121548.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289055,"comment":null},{"amount":68.52,"local_amount":120918,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":123877.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157207,"comment":null},{"amount":69.83,"local_amount":123236,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126252.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230211,"comment":null},{"amount":71.18,"local_amount":125598,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":128672.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509084,"comment":null},{"amount":72.53,"local_amount":128005,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":131138.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673311,"comment":null},{"amount":73.93,"local_amount":130459,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":133652.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319874,"comment":null},{"amount":241.1,"local_amount":425472,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":435886.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803033,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-24T16:04:07Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":240686,"name":"Maribel Arcadia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maribel de 47 a\u00f1os, tiene su peque\u00f1o negocio que es la venta de comida.

is a 43-year-old mother of three who lives with her husband and children in Siquirres, located near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. She runs a business selling merchandise such as children\u00b4s games, cutlery, household products and decorations. Her clients are mostly family members, neighbors, friends and acquaintances who live in her community. This loan will be used to finance the purchase of such merchandise. Sonia wakes up every day at 5:00 AM. After carrying out domestic tasks (preparing breakfast and lunch, cleaning) she goes to work producing bread (another product she sells). In the afternoons, she heads into her community to make sales, collect payments from clients and deliver her products. Her goals are to expand her business and to one day own a central location where she would be able to sell her merchandise (to avoid having to travel so much). \r\n\r\nThe loan consultant who has been working with Sonia describes her as a hardworking, amicable, energetic entrepreneur with the ability and inclination to develop and expand her productive activity in an effort to improve her living conditions.

The project is funded by an IDB loan in an effort to improve the housing sector in a country severely affected by hurricanes. Kelvin hopes to win the bid by setting up a hurricane-resistant model home that is capable of withstanding winds of up to 200 mph, category 9 earthquakes, as well as fire and termite damage. \r\n\r\nKelvin is using the loan money from ACCION to help buy materials for the model home. This is his first loan from ACCION, and he views it as a first step in a multi-tiered program to grow his business. If Kelvin had been unable to get this loan from ACCION he would have needed to search for another investor, which he believes would have been difficult. The loan from ACCION is manageable for his budget and will allow him to build the model home, as well as place him in a better position to seek future investment from other financial institutions. He has said, \u201cIn these economic times, you have to be careful. You have to be sure you are able to carry the debt forward, and this is why it is better for me to start off with ACCION.\u201d \r\n\r\nIf R&R Building Material Corp. wins the housing contract, Kelvin will be able to pursue his goal for the company to manufacture its own houses, no longer needing to use their current outside manufacturing source in Alabama. Married with two high school-age children, Kelvin also works nights checking inventory at AT&T in order to supplement his income. He says he has put a lot of emphasis on and capital into getting the Caribbean contract, which he knows will propel his business upward. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe loan experience with ACCION has been a pleasant one,\u201d Kelvin states, \u201c I would recommend it as a great way to access funding for any small business. Hopefully I can realize our dream.\u201d

She is a very enterprising woman, always in search of businesses that will allow her to earn income so that she can help her husband with the household expenses.  For five years now, she has sold all types of shoes as an itinerant vendor.  She has contacts in the north of the country who send her orders to her, which she sells at the best price in the capital.  One thing she dislikes about her business is that she often offers her merchandise on credit, and some customers fall behind on their payments.  For this reason, she prefers to sell her shoes for cash.  Also, since she is hard-working, she earns substantial weekly income that makes is possible for her to pull off a good quality of life.  In the future, she hopes to install a showcase in her house so she can offer her merchandise there as well.  She is also excited because the summer season is approaching and she already has orders for sandals.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

J. started his construction company, Rock Enterprises Construction, 11 years ago in New Orleans when he realized that many of his friends and family who hired businesses to do repairs were often charged unreasonable prices. He started his business to provide affordable and quality work to residents of New Orleans and has since moved to the commercial and industrial sectors. Five years ago, Damion had to shut down his business after Hurricane Katrina hit the Louisiana coast. Through perserverence and hard work, Damion was able to pull his business together. There was fewer work with fewer people in New Orleans, and also, less people willing to invest in their homes. For people who needed renovation, many unlicensed contractors came to New Orleans and took advantage of that demand. All these factors contributed to making it very difficult for Damion to build his business back up again.\r\n\r\nThis same situation has happened again with the recent oil spill. Damion had seven large residential projects planned before the oil spill that would have brought almost $ 1 million to his company. However, because of the oil spill devastating the area, investors were not as willing to invest in these homes and decided to not go through with the projects. Damion and his 15 employees had been counting on those projects and now he does not have enough money to tide the business over until they get their next big project, which is currently under way. With this loan, Damion plans to  pay his employees and rent big machinery. Without this loan, Damion would not be able to complete this big project and would be forced to let go of some of his employees.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3143.27,"image":{"id":621461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"New

She longed to be independent and, when for the first time there were public safety issues in the area where she lived, she didn't hesitate. She moved with her family to the town where she now lives and set up her own business aged 24, when she was already married.\r\n\r\nThere were some challenges at first adapting to the new situation, but gradually she and her husband have been \"matching their workload\". \r\nHer first capital was the compensation received by her husband when he was working. She used it to set up a store, but poor credit issuing eventually caused bankrupcy.

Narciso is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Narciso from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Gemma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI.

Josie is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase tires and needed materials to provide services. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Josie from ASKI.

R., 45 years old, owns a small shop located in front of her house where she sells coffee. She typically makes around US$ 3 in profit each day to support her family. Svay R. has been married for many years to Mr. Nou Kan, 59, a local farmer, and they now have two school-aged children, one of whom attends university while the other one attends a high school.\r\n\r\nSvay R., is running her business smoothly because she has skills in public relations which she uses with her customers. Currently, she wants to earn more extra income by feeding a few pigs around her house, but she doesn\u2019t have cash to make that possible. Therefore, Svay R. is requesting a loan to purchase pigs to fatten to add more profit.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":623152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase piglets to fatten","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kompong Tom","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2010-10-22T18:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":318375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191576234,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195863985,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T08:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201561879,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206173803,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211247324,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-19T07:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216995126,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222109561,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227063051,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-22T23:42:35Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:29:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":240893,"name":"Eden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eden F. is from the village of La Paz, Saguday, Quirino.

E. is a married woman who lives in Camp Valdez, Brgy. Mambaroto, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Tobacco vending and vegetable vending businesses. Her husband Mamerto E., who is 56 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have ten children between 15 and  36 years old. \r\n\r\nPerfecta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Perfecta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for tobacco vending so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nPerfecta E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is thirty-two years old. She is single and has three children between the ages of twelve and three. Her business is located at a very busy market in Mwingi and is known Mama ka Kim. Agnes is served by the Thika branch. Thika is the region in Kenya known for the production of pineapples. \r\n\r\nAgnes provides tailoring services by making clothes such as skirts, blouses, dresses and shirts. She serves the local people, and she has been in this business for five years now. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is that her customers take too long in coming to pick up the clothes, therefore delaying payments and tying up her capital.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying cooking ingredients like rice, beans, oil, meats and vegetables.

She then started her story as an entrepreneur when she decidedly began her business selling miscellaneous merchandise, renting out a house belonging to a relative near where she was living. Before starting her business, Francia took stock of the potential customers around her, where a high school was located. Therefore, she thought about selling school supplies and stationary products such as poster board, pencils, pens, erasers, markers, etc. She stopped renting the house and her aunt allowed her to move into her house and set up her business. In this way, the rent that she was no longer paying was reinvested and little by little she began to stock her business with various types of products. \r\n\r\nGradually her clientele grew and so she joined the Mario Santa Domingo Foundation over 4 years ago. This is her third loan and with the others she managed to increase her income as well as her self-sufficiency. She was also able to develop her potential to the point that currently she is providing an additional service in the field of computer science -- she offers personalized classes and has had a lot of success with this in the community. The growth of her business has allowed her to support her entire family. Due to this, her dream is to convert her business into a large department store and to help everyone who has lent her a helping hand. This is her third loan with Kiva and with it she will buy merchandise to get ready for the holidays, such as home decorations, cosmetics, and toys that she will wrap so that her customers will buy their holiday gifts there. With this, she will be able to increase her working capital and rotate her merchandise more quickly in order to display what her customers need during this beautiful Christmas season.

For four years, he has driven a moto-taxi in and around the city of Chiclayo, carrying passengers to work, on errands and to visit friends. This is a service that exhibits significant competition, but allows a certain level of flexibility and autonomy in the work, a fact that Clari appreciates.\r\n\r\nThe loan is requested in order to make repairs to the moto-taxi and purchase a number of accessories for it. The actions will reduce his ongoing maintenance expenses and he hopes to draw additional clientele. Clari has taken out loans from Edpyme Alternativa in the past. He has always paid punctually and responsibly. He has an excellent credit history and our analysis has approved him for the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":623525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle
