While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRita is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Rita owns & operates a business selling fish in the local community. Rita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Rita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital. Rita is requesting a new loan of 10,500 PHP, which will be used as additional capital in expanding the business. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Rita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living standard of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Montealto Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovita M. is from the village of Tinaclaan, Clarin, Misamis Occdiental. She is 59 years old. Jovita is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJovita is married and has 10 adult children. To make a living, Jovita owns & operates a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jovita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jovita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Jovita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":526586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

L. is a busy entrepreneur managing her farm and pig-raising business. Her previous loan from KIVA has provided working capital to expand her business and purchase additional piglets and farming equipment. With the loan, Nieva has noticed that her monthly income has almost doubled since she has attracted new customers with additional inventory.\r\n\r\nNieva joined the Kiva partner, ASHI, in 2006, attracted by ASHI's lower interest rates and range of loans for business, education and home repair. Prior to ASHI, Nieva had no access to capital to support her entrepreneurial dreams. Positive growth from her business has helped Nieva fund the education of her grandchildren. \r\n\r\nSince joining ASHI, Nieva has experienced positive changes in her life, as she now owns her own home and uses the additional income to support her third venture, a sari-sari (variety) store. Nieva hopes her businesses will continue to flourish so she can proviD. long-term financial stability for her family.\r\n\r\nThe hog-raising business provides good income for them and that\u2019s why, even if sometimes raising pigs is hard to do, she never gets tired of doing it. Therefore, she is now requesting another KIVA loan, this time for 40,000 PHP, to purchase feed for the pigs, to buy additional piglets and to support the maintenance of her variety store business. This will allow her to grow her businesses further so that her grandchildren can fulfill their dreams of completing a college degree and experience a life that\u2019s full of

T. (5) is a 57 year-old woman living in the town of Hoang Hoa - Thanh Hoa. She is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 02.03.011-Hoang Hoa (02.03.011 Hoang Hoa).\n\nHong is married and has three adult children. To making a living, she raises cattle for sale and has done so for over 10 years earning approximately 600.000 VND a month.\n\nIn 2003, Hong joined the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. The loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 2.442.600 VND which will also be used to purchase baby livestock. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Hong from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\n\n\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\n\n1.  C. T. Hang (61) is a 50 year-old woman who is requesting a 3.079.800 VND loan to support her business raising livestock.\n\n2.  N. T. Diem (37) is a 27 year-old woman who is requesting a 2.442.600 VND loan to support her business raising livestock.\n\n3.  C. T.

Lieu (71) is a 32 year-old woman who is requesting a 2.442.600 VND loan to support her business raising livestock.\n\n\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\n\nThe mission of the Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nHong N.

They are, on average, 45 years old, married and have at least three children each. \r\nThis group of women deals in various products such as charcoal, firewood, clothing, cereals, etc.  To grow their business, the members decided to get involved with the loan institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. They are on their thirteenth group loan and all of the previous loans have been properly repaid. \r\nWassa Traor\u00e9 is a member of the group Victoire who sells charcoal.  She plans to use her loan to buy cartloads of charcoal from producers.  She gets her charcoal in different parts of the backwoods.  Her stock of charcoal stored on her family land is very important.  She sells charcoal at retail for cash at the main market of Koutiala to a diverse and varied clientele. \r\nWhile the other members of the group Victoire plan to clear a profit of 160,000 FCFA during this loan cycle, Wassa Traor\u00e9 plans to clear 190,000 FCFA.\r\nIn addition to repaying the loans, they use a part of their income to meet daily family expenses.  They hope to strengthen this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso so that supplies will not run out. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":526818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase charcoal                                                                               ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydie  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"D\u00e9vora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746640,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779213,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961415,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699533,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913431,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180604,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476583,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613368,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-20T23:07:40Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194236,"name":"Battumur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Battumur is 31 years old and lives with his parents in Arhangai province, Mongolia.

He is 49 years old, married, and the father of five children between the ages of 1 and 18.  The four eldest go to school. M\u00e1rio finished sixth grade but did not continue because of the death of his parents.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports his sister and sister-in-law, who live in Inhambane, by sending them 1,000 meticais every three months.\r\n \r\nHe left Inhambane Province to go with his elder brother to Namaacha, on the border with Swaziland, after losing his parents.  He continued with his studies and finished sixth grade.  Later he was employed by TDM as a telecommunications service operator.  He has been a permanent employee there for more than 16 years and earns a salary of 5,500 meticais, working from 7:00 am until 2:00 pm on the morning shift and 2:00 pm until 10:00 pm on the evening shift. When he married his wife, living with his brother was no longer agreeable, so he felt he should leave the house and live in a rented house while he built his own; but since he did not have enough money to complete the project, he approached Hluvuku-Adsema and asked for a loan to continue the work.\r\n\r\nThis is M\u00e1rio's third loan with Hluvuku and his second with Kiva.  The first loan of 8,000 meticais and the second of 20,000 meticais were used to buy construction materials, but owing to rising costs of materials, he was not able to finish the house.  This third loan for 15,000 meticais will be used for the same purpose.  M\u00e1rio and his family live in their own house, and he is confident that he will repay the loan on time and ask for another to furnish the house and make his family comfortable.<br

She is 35 years old, widowed, and the mother of two children, ages 12 and 9.  Both of them go to school.  Olinda finished seventh grade.  She had to quit when she became pregnant with her first child, but she is currently attending eighth grade.  She lives in her parents' house and is not responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe left Inhambane Province to go with her parents to Namaacha District on the border with Swaziland, where she began her studies, and stopped them when she married her husband, who passed away, leaving her with two children. Olinda's life was difficult owing to a dispute with her in-laws over property division, so she was kicked out of her own house and went to live with her parents.  Today she works at the Hotel Li Bombos as a waitress.  She has worked there for 16 years, working from 7:00 am until 3:00 pm and earning 1,600 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses and cannot save anything, so she asked Hluvuku-Adsema for a loan to buy the title for her land and build a house on it.\r\n \r\nOlinda has never had loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku from her father, who is also a customer of Hluvuku-Adsema.  This is her second loan from Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  She will use this loan of 10,000 meticais to buy construction materials (loads of sand, cement and blocks) to begin building her house.  The earlier loan of 5,000 meticais was used to buy the title to her land. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

M. was born in Chibuto District, Gaza Province in southern Mozambique.  She is 45 years old, married, and mother to 7 children between the ages of 5 and 22.  Six of the children go to school.  When Argentina was training to be a teacher, she left her studies because of the war.  She lives in her own house with her family and is not responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nBecause of the war, Argentina left Gaza Province to go to Namaacha, on the border with Swaziland, and set up her home with her husband, who works in South Africa.  She has had her own business for more than 10 years.  She has no employees.  She works by filling orders, traveling twice a month.  Blankets are her most-ordered product.  Her monthly income is around 3,500 meticais, and she manages to save 1,500 meticais with her husband's help.\r\n\r\nThis is Argentina's third loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  She is asking for 10,000 meticais, with which she will try to buy a variety of linens (blankets, duvets, sheets and curtains) for resale.  She promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out more loans.  She dreams of building her own shop and no longer being a traveling saleswoman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

G. was born in the Gaza province in the south of Mozambique.  He is 60 years old and married, and the father of 3 children ages 19 to 23.  He completed through the second grade in the old system, and dropped out due to the poor treatment he received at school for being a farmer's son.   \r\n\r\nHe left Chokw\u00e9 for Maputo to look for work.  He worked at Hotel Rovuma as a server for 5 years, but earned little.  He had an offer to work in the Hotel Libombos in the district of Namaacha on the border of Swaziland.  He went to work there for 2 years but left the job due to the bad working environment with his coworkers, who felt that he did not deserve the position that he held.  But with the money he had earned and the help of his wife who is a seamstress, Albino opened his own tailoring and shoe cobbling business, activities he had learned with the missionary nuns when he attended school.  Today he is the owner of a tailoring and cobbler shop called TchapoTchapo.  Albino is very happy because today he is one of the most requested tailors in the district thanks to the sewing machine he was able to buy with a loan from Hluvuku and Kiva.  That machine was stolen, which has made his work more difficult. \r\n\r\nHe works from 7am to 6pm at his shop except on Thursdays and Saturdays.  He has a stand in the market that is opened twice per week.  He has had more profits from the shoes because he has a lot of work, especially during the rainy season because shoes often come apart due to the muddy clay that exists during that time.  He has had monthly profits of 6.000mt and is able to save 1.500.00mt per month because he is not supporting anyone because he is the only one of his family who survived the war. \r\n\r\nThis is Albino's fourth loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva.  The first three were used to purchase fabric and a machine to grind shoe soles.  He is requesting this fourth loan of 15.000.00 to purchase a sewing machine because at the beginning of the year he had many requests for school uniforms and wants to meet the needs of all of his customers and make greater profits.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Amirkhon is a low-income, vulnerable person. He is 35 and lives with his wife and three children.\r\n\r\nAmirkhon has a grocery store where he sells foodstuffs. The business is very successful but needs some investment of capital to increase its daily turnover. That's why Amirkhon has applied to IMON International for a loan of 3000 US Dollars. This loan will allow him to buy bigger amounts of goods for resale to better provide for his family and save more money to be able to get married. With your collaboration he\u2019ll be able to crystallize his dreams in a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in government housing provided to her husband, a civil servant, and in addition to her family supports a grandson who lives with them.\r\nShe and her parents left Vilancuos for Boane because of the war that destabilized the country. After she got married she started her business, and has been working at it more than 10 years. She doesn't have any employees and brings in about 7000 meticals a month, which is enough to cover household expenses and even save a little with Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\nShe's never received loans from other banks. She learned about Hvuluku from friends who are also Hvuluku clients. This is her fifth loan, in the amount of 20,000 meticals, which she intends to use to purchase supplies (blankets, scarves, etc.) to increase her stock. The earlier loans were in the amounts of 10,200, 10,000, 15,000, and 17,000 meticals, all for the same purpose.\r\nIn the future she'd like to request additional loans to finish construction on her own house and be able to move out of government housing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

She has requested a loan of Kes 70,000 from Faulu Kenya to buy a motorcycle to make distribution of her products easy. She hopes to grow her business and improve her living standard in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":864.09,"image":{"id":526874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To

Harriet remains undeterred, even when the odds of life seem not to be basking in her favor. Her divorce sob-story was ominously threatening to throw her off her feet and she was saddled with heavy responsibilities after her husband left her. However, she took it in her stride, knowing what the implications of not having a steady means of livelihood would have on her four children.\r\n\r\nWith her naivete, Harriet had to obtain a footing in business. The kind of business she first opted for was at a low ebb and was fraught with heavy competition. With the help of friends, her business journey began.\r\n\r\nHarriet ventured into a salon business in her home area in Seeta, Mukono district, Uganda. During her three years experience in this business, her stock in trade has been the cordial working relationship she has established with her client base. With her workers she has established an all-hands-to-the-pump business approach which has, over time, produced results for her business.\r\n\r\nIn a month, Harriet says she is able to make profits totaling 250,000 Ugandan shillings. The costs of running this kind of competitive business have, however, taken their toll on the business\u2019s annual profits. It\u2019s for this reason that she figures a loan will significantly impact on her business as she will be able to buy more salon equipment. On top of that she also wants to expand her

He lives with his wife and one dependent child in the rural community of Cruz del Medano in the M\u00f3rrope district.  This district characteristically has most of its population dispersed in rural areas.  The main activities are farming and raising animals.  It belongs to the Lambayeque province, which is located 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nJuan has been raising and selling animals for over 20 years.  He raises poultry and pigs in the area behind his house.  When the animals have grown well enough, he sells them to businessmen who visit the area.  He also sells to his neighbors.  This activity provides income to help support his family.  The income from his farming work is not enough to support his family.\r\n\r\nThis activity is well received in the area.  Juan wishes to expand his business in order to get more income and get ahead.  Therefore, he has seen the need, for the first time, to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan for 2,000 PEN.  He plans to use the money to buy more small animals and balanced food.  This way he plans to achieve his objective.\r\n\r\nJuan is very devoted to his family.  He always thinks about the well-being and progress of his loved ones.  That is why he puts forth maximum effort in his work.

This is a district in which most residents live in rural areas and are scattered.  The principal businesses in the district are farming and the sale of animals.  The district is part of Lambayeque Province and is located one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda has been raising and selling animals for approximately two years.  She raises poultry and pigs at her home and offers them for sale every 15 days at the Moshoqueque Market (the wholesale market of Chiclayo).  In addition, she sells them to traders who sometimes visit the area where she lives.\r\n<p>\r\nThis business provides her with income that she uses in helping her husband with the support of the family.  This is why it is very important for her to maintain the quality of her animals, feeding them with \u201cpolvillo\u201d (an animal feed made from rice) and natural fodder.\r\n<p>\r\nThe increase in demand for the animals she offers for sale has caused her to think about enlarging her business.  For this reason she is applying to Epydme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 1500 new soles.  She plans to invest the loan in the purchase of animals and nutritious feed which will allow her to succeed in meeting her goals.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is a woman who works very hard to offer her recently established family a stable future.

rurales que quedan dispersas, el pueblo capital donde vive se caracteriza por poseer bastante comercio, ya que es el principal centro de abasto para los habitantes de la zonas aleda\u00f1as, este distrito pertenece a la provincia de Lambayeque y se encuentra ubicado a media hora de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nCristina se gana la vida comercializando verduras en un mercadillo de la ciudad de Lambayeque desde hace mas de ocho a\u00f1os, todos los dias ella se moviliza muy temprano al mercado Moshoqueque (mercado mayorista de la regi\u00f3n) a comprar sus productos que luego ofrece a sus clientes durante todo el dia y parte de la tarde. Como los productos que ofrece son frescos, su negocio siempre goza de mucha demanda y  ha llegado a tener una clientela fidelizada.\n\nLa continua demanda por los productos que ofrece en su negocio han hecho que piense en ampliar su puesto de venta, por ello se encuentra solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de verduras para lograr su objetivo.\n\nCristina es una mujer luchadora y que da lo mejor de si para sacar a sus hijos adelante, su mayor anhelo es verlos realizados y convertidos en excelentes profesionales.

The regional capital where she lives, however, does have quite a bit of commerce because it\u2019s the main supply center for the outlying areas.  This district is part of Lambayeque province and it\u2019s half an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nCristina earns her living selling vegetables in a small market in Lambayeque; she\u2019s been in this line of work for over 8 years.  Every day she goes to the Moshoqueque market (regional wholesale market) very early to buy her products that she then resells to her customers all day and into the evening.  \r\nBecause all her products are fresh, demand is high and she has built up a good base of regular customers.\r\n\r\nContinued demand for her products has made her consider expanding her stall.  This is why she\u2019s asking Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a 1500 new sol loan to buy vegetables to reach this goal.\r\n\r\nCristina is a tenacious woman who gives all of herself to have her children succeed in life.  Her greatest wish is to see them become fully developed into professionals.

This will support the family's stability, allowing their children to have more optimal social conditions that contribute to their daily lives, and giving the parents the satisfaction of being able to offer their children a better standard of living. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":527083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanina Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.89,"local_amount":677.71,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":711.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604661,"comment":null},{"amount":33.28,"local_amount":665.53,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":699,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640199,"comment":null},{"amount":34.91,"local_amount":698.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":733.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821997,"comment":null},{"amount":33.78,"local_amount":675.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":709.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562009,"comment":null},{"amount":33.45,"local_amount":668.92,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":702.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770921,"comment":null},{"amount":31.14,"local_amount":622.77,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":654.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204812,"comment":null},{"amount":33.68,"local_amount":673.55,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":707.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330508,"comment":null},{"amount":58.29,"local_amount":1165.82,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1224.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465666,"comment":null},{"amount":7.58,"local_amount":151.93,"processed_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":159.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097812,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T22:46:31Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194361,"name":"Mayra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mayra R.

Romero is a young 22 year old woman who lives with her mother in a community called Ca\u00f1o Negro, located in Los Chiles, in the province of Alajuela.  This community is distinctive for being mountainous, and for being very close to the northern frontier of our country.  Its principal economic activities are livestock and agriculture, specifically the growth of basic grains, sugarcane, and oranges.\r\n\r\nSince Mayra finished high school, she worked helping her mother with household chores, as she had not yet found a job.  Thanks to the development of sustainable tourism in the area where she lives, various hotels opened that needed staff.  Thanks to the English that she learned in high school, today she is working as a receptionist in the Hotel Natural Lodge.  With this work, she has been able to improve the lives of her family and herself.\r\n\r\nDue to her schedule and the distance from her house, she has to walk alone from the place where the bus lets her off to her house at all hours of the night.  It is for this reason that she is asking for a loan of \u00a2666,000 (six hundred and sixty-six thousand colones) for the purchase of a motorcycle so she can transport herself to the hotel and so continue with her job. \r\n\r\nMayra is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Emcrecoba, one of the 100 member organizations belonging to EDESA in Costa Rica.  This would be her first loan.  However, she emphasizes that thanks to this type of organization and related credit facilitations, many people without sufficient resources can reach their dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Ms. Vanessa P. collaborated with us. <p>\r\nMs. P. has been married since she was a teenager. She is 19 years old and already has her first baby, who is two years old. She has been our client for three loan cycles, and she states that it has not been easy having to deal with so many activities, but she has been able to get ahead. She sells beauty products by catalog for a living. When she was 18, her sister-in-law motivated her to join the Yanbal company, and she has been in business with them for a year. With her previous loans, she has been able to purchase beauty products. Her clientele has now grown. <p>\r\nVanessa states that during the time that she has been in business, everything that she has been able to do has been very interesting to her. She now has her own capital to invest entirely in purchasing the products that her customers order so that she can give them credit for a longer period of time.

Mujer Camino Al Sol Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is composed of 9 woman members who live in Talamanca, Lim\u00f3n, located near the hot and humid Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The formation of this group was inspired by the positive experience of one of its members as part of another group with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The name of this group, 'Camino Al Sol', which translates as 'The Path of the Sun', has special significance to the members. The rising sun symbolizes the start of the work day and the rays it gives off illuminate the path for the members to follow. All the members of this group are motivated to improve their standard of living for themselves, their family and community. \r\n\r\nFor many members of this group, the use of their land is central to their productive activities. These are:  harvesting plantains, rearing and selling animals (chickens, pigs), and the management of a small store.  Other activities include the sale of propane gas, as well as clothing and cosmetic sales. This loan will be used by each woman to invest in her business at her discretion.  The women of this group have developed close personal relationships; they are a mix of neighbors and family members. This will be their first loan as a group with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nAugustina is a 32-year-old mother of four who lives with her husband and children; she is also the elected president of this group. Augustina owns and runs a small store from her home in Talamanca. This loan will be used to invest in the expansion of her store. She says that half of her income is gained at the store while she earns the other half by harvesting plantains. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this loan will be used increase her store inventory levels in basic products such as lard, butter and rice. For Augustina, the work day starts at 7AM and ends at 4PM; the whole family contributes when it comes to carrying out the responsibilities of running the business.  Augustina\u00b4s goal is to be able to earn more income in order to re-invest in her store's operations. Her goal is to be able to offer her clients higher quality and more diverse products. She also hopes to improve her ability to support the studies of her children financially by optimizing the success of her business.  \r\n\r\nAugustina says her only obstacle is the lack of working capital she needs in order to make improvements to her store. This loan will help her to overcome this obstacle. Augustina says there are advantages to the group lending methodology, as compared to the individual method, \u00a8If we\u00b4re united there is better support and communication. It makes the credit more solid.\u00a8\r\n\r\nXinia plans to use this loan to purchase tanks of propane gas. She buys tanks for 8500 colones and sells them for 10,000. With this loan, she should be able to purchase 11 tanks and earn 16,500 colones profit (US$ 30).  \r\n\r\nAndreina, Rosibel, and Regina will use this loan to finance the purchase of catalogue products. These group members spend their days travelling in their communities, looking for clients to offer their products to (colognes, clothing, kitchen appliances, and cleaners, among other products). After collecting orders, the women travel to a central location to purchase the requested items from the catalogue company. Since they are paid upon delivery of the requested products, women who make sales in this way often lack the initial capital to make their first purchase.  This loan will be used to finance the purchase of ordered products and enable the women to return to their communities with inventory for sale. \r\n\r\nLidieth, Liveth and Josefa are involved in animal rearing. These group members will use their loan to invest in the purchase of livestock (pigs and chickens) as well as animal feed and nutrients to keep the animals healthy. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":527134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"basic products such as lard, butter and rice, etc. for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xinia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andre\u00edna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosibel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidieth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liveth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryorie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":143872.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146270.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":148708.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":151186.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":153706.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156256.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.1},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":259.81,"local_amount":143895,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":144350.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712589,"comment":null},{"amount":264.14,"local_amount":146293.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":146755.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047948,"comment":null},{"amount":268.54,"local_amount":148731.47,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":149201.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763258,"comment":null},{"amount":273.02,"local_amount":151210.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":151688.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850743,"comment":null},{"amount":283.01,"local_amount":156741.57,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":157237.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258682,"comment":null},{"amount":276.48,"local_amount":153128.38,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":153612.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411554,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-21T01:32:17Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194380,"name":"Ronald","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEL SE\u00d1OR RONALD ESTA CASADO Y TIENE 2 HIJOS QUE SE ENCUENTRAN EN EDAD ESCOLAR, SE DEDICA AL SERVICIO DE TRANSPORTE PUBLICO YA HACE DIEZ A\u00d1OS ATR\u00c1S SIENDO ESTA SU UNICA ACTIVIDAD, EL TRABAJA TODO EL DIA ES UN TRABAJO SACRIFICADO, TRABAJA MUCHO YA QUE EL ES EL UNICO QUE MANTIENE A SUS PADRES QUE EN LA ACTUALIDAD SOLO DEPENDEN DE EL, Y A US ESPOSA Y A SUS HIJOS ES POR ESTA RAZON QUE RONALD TRABAJA EN HORARIOS CONTINUOS MA\u00d1ANA TARDE Y NOCHE, ESTO PARA PODER BRINDAR MEJORES COMODIDADES, ALIMENTACION Y EDUCACION A LOS MIENBROS DE SU FAMILIA, TIENE MUCHAS GANAS DE SUPERACION.

As a result of his constant efforts, he has 2 houses, located in the beautiful Cuzque\u00f1a rainforest, which he has not finished building.  For Alejandro, the biggest challenges are the competition, which compels him to keep growing, and his desire to improve his techniques in agricultural production.  He has been working hard in agriculture for 36 years cultivating coffee.   He usually receives the help of his beloved wife, but at harvest times he needs to hire workers, of whom he has 3, to help him harvest his products that are later sold in the central wholesale market in his area at a competitive price.  Despite having grown up on the basis of much effort and sacrifice, he is looking ahead, and he now plans to expand and fix up his home for the greater comfort of his family.  He feels satisfied because of what he has achieved, and he believes that he still has new goals to reach for.  This is his 2nd loan with MFP, and he assures us that he will comply with the terms of his payments.  In addition, he feels supported by his communal bank.  With the loan that he requests, he will carry out the appropriate maintenance on his farm, so that he can prevent future risks to his coffee crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":527151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to maintain his farmlands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-21T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1559.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154022,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T11:01:34Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194393,"name":"Conchan De Milagro (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco  Conchan de Milagro est\u00e1 formado por un grupo de se\u00f1oras que siempre buscan el bienestar para sus familias y lo est\u00e1n logrando con el esfuerzo de su trabajo diario, su perseverancia,  viven en la comunidad Conchan de Milagro ubicada  a unos 45 minutos fuera de la ciudad de Cuenca, su gente se dedica a la agricultura y  es un bello sector ya que desde all\u00ed se puede observar la ciudad de Cuenca.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Blanca C. es socia de \u00e9ste banco desde hace tres ciclos,  tiene 22 a\u00f1os y  vive  en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja y su hijo de dos meses de nacido  en casa de su mam\u00e1 compartiendo los gastos del hogar porque a\u00fan no tienen casa propia, su esposo trabaja en una carpinter\u00eda y ella se dedica  a la costura, estudi\u00f3 tres a\u00f1os en una academia, trabajaba en una f\u00e1brica de jeans pero con el nacimiento de su primog\u00e9nito  dej\u00f3 de trabajar.\n\nBlanca tiene una linda amistad con todas sus compa\u00f1eras del bankito, los pr\u00e9stamos recibidos ha invertido en el nacimiento de  su beb\u00e9,  con el nuevo cr\u00e9dito va a pagar una c\u00f3moda que adquiri\u00f3  para su bebe, su meta es  seguir en lo que m\u00e1s le gusta que es la costura.\n\nRosa Dom\u00ednguez se encuentra en su segundo ciclo en su banco comunal invitada por sus amigas y socias del bankito, los cr\u00e9ditos le han beneficiado para comprar pollos y cuyes actividad que inici\u00f3 hace dos a\u00f1os  compartiendo con los quehaceres del hogar y cuidado de sus hijos,  \u00e9stos animales cr\u00eda tanto para venderlos como para el consumo en su hogar.\n\nNuestra  vive en la comunidad Conchan de Milagro a las afueras de la ciudad de Cuenca, est\u00e1 casada hace algunos a\u00f1os  y es madre de seis hijos que se  encuentran  de 17, 15, 13, 10, 9, 8 a\u00f1os de edad, sus tres primeros hijos se estudian  en diferentes colegios de la ciudad y los tres  menores en una escuela de la localidad,  su esposo trabaja en una carpinter\u00eda pero siempre se encuentra haciendo trabajos extras fuera de su trabajo para redondear su sueldo, adem\u00e1s nos comenta que la casa en la que viven es propia fruto de mucho esfuerzo y sacrificio conyugal\n\nCon el dinero del credito solicitado comprar\u00e1  una sierra el\u00e9ctrica  para los trabajos de carpinter\u00eda de su esposo.

El cont\u00ednuo uso brindado a su unidad m\u00f3vil y el estado accidentado de los caminos, en su mayor\u00eda trochas carrozables, han hecho que su mototaxi empiece a sufrir algunas fallas que requieren de urgente reparaci\u00f3n para su correcto funcionamiento, por este motivo se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la reparaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de su veh\u00edculo.\n\nLuis es muy trabajador y entregado a sus labores, su mayor anhelo es seguir creciendo como empresario para poder sacar adelante a su familia, en la zona donde vive el es considerado una persona honorable y de confianza.\n\n","en":"54-year old Luis lives with his family in the district of Nuevo Arica, a hilly agricultural area with a small population. It is located about an hour and a half from the town of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nLuis' job is providing freight and passenger transportation in a motortaxi (a motorized vehicle used for carrying goods and passengers). He's been doing this for more than two years. He was able to buy the vehicle out of his savings from the candy-selling business he operates from his house. He supports his family with the income from the business, so he works hard and with much dedication to keep it running well.\r\n\r\nHis transportation service covers routes within the town of Nuevo Arica, neighbouring villages, and eventually he hopes to extend to the nearby district of Cayalt\u00ed. He works throughout the day and into the evening. The constant use of his vehicle and the rough state of the roads, most of them unsurfaced trails, have made his motortaxi begin to deteriorate and urgent repairs are needed so that it runs properly. As a result Luis needs a loan, his first one, from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa, of 500 soles which he plans to use for the repair and maintenance of his vehicle.\r\n\r\nLuis is very hardworking and dedicated to his work. His greatest desire is to continue expanding his business so that he can help his family get ahead. In the area in which he lives, he is considered an honourable, trustworthy person.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":527259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair and maintain his motortaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nueva Arica - Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-04-21T09:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Washington","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":46.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":57.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.7},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.98},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.94,"local_amount":42.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":48.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695161,"comment":null},{"amount":18.11,"local_amount":45.28,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878205,"comment":null},{"amount":18.49,"local_amount":46.24,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618233,"comment":null},{"amount":18.78,"local_amount":46.94,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":53.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832632,"comment":null},{"amount":19.7,"local_amount":49.25,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":55.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099240,"comment":null},{"amount":19.98,"local_amount":49.96,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":56.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554654,"comment":null},{"amount":21.18,"local_amount":52.93,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":60.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530077,"comment":null},{"amount":21.58,"local_amount":53.97,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":61.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666228,"comment":null},{"amount":22.27,"local_amount":55.66,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409565,"comment":null},{"amount":22.97,"local_amount":57.43,"processed_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108011,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-21T16:38:12Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194439,"name":"Deicy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Deicy tiene 40 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy trabajadora, convive con Emilse de 42 a\u00f1os, quien es mec\u00e1nico y sus hijos Johana de 8 a\u00f1os, Susan de 7 a\u00f1os y Diego de 2 a\u00f1os.

E. is from the village of Panay Daku, Clarin, Misamis Occidnetal. He is 59 years old. Wenceslao is married and has 7 adult children. To make a living, Wenceslao owns & operates a business in agriculture sector. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Wenceslao has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Wenceslao joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wenceslao has successfully repaid a previous loan of 33,000 PHP from GDMPC. Wenceslao is requesting a new loan of 20,500 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer for his rice. This will be the eleventh loan taken out by Wenceslao from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And all day, until late at night, he is busy looking after the cattle. Vali says that he works with only one aim in mind - to provide his children with a proper education.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 26 years old and lives with his wife and their two children. He has been very familiar with agriculture since he was young. Thanks to his parents he knows how to work the land. Now he supports himself entirely from potato and wheat production. He works all day weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing his fields so that his production will be good. He has always liked weeding his fields because it is important and is lighter work than many of his tasks. \r\n\r\nOzodjon wants to improve his family's quality of life; that wish provides the motivation for his arduous work. He will invest the loan in the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, with the aim of having the best production in his community in a few months. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients haver a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in hopes to have secured access to capital for the continuation of her dying business. Her previous loans were carefully utilized as additional and rolling capital for her sari-sari store (a small retail store selling different goods). She is very determined and disciplined to use the money which is lent to her. Now on her 8th loan, Dolores proposes a loan of 25,000 pesos as additional working capital for her store. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for inventories of groceries for her store. Dolores is hopeful that her business will grow into a full-fledge mini-grocery store and that someday she will have branches in nearby villages. Dolores also dreams of sending all her grandchildren to school until college and that they find jobs.

She is 29 years old, married, and mother of a two-year-old son who does not yet attend school.  Aurora finished twelfth grade but did not continue because she began working and was unable to go ahead with school.  She lives in teachers' housing with her family and supports a nephew and a cousin who live with her.\n\nShe left Moatize for Boane when she came to visit relatives and ended up staying to continue her studies.  She works as a teacher and has been employed by the Ministry of Education for more than six years.  She has no employees and receives a monthly salary of 5,570 meticais, which she uses for household expenses.  She also manages to save some money in her bank account.\n\nAurora had a previous loan with Tchuma Credit Union but decided not to continue with them for several reasons.  She learned about Hluvuku through co-workers who are also customers of this institution.  This is her third loan.  She is asking for 21,300 meticais which she will use to buy construction materials (zinc sheets, block, beams, cement and other items) to continue construction on her house.  The previous loans of 5,000 meticais and 10,000 meticais were for the same purpose.\n\n\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time to maintain her good credit.  In the future she would like to ask for more loans so she can finish her house.\n\n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Mary Ann performs well in her business; when she has enough capital, she adds more business in order to gain more income. Chicks she raises will be sold, after two to three months, to people in their village.

He is 40 years old, married and the father of three children, ages 16, 12 and 6 years.  They all go to school.  Ernesto only finished sixth grade.  He did not continue school due to financial difficulties.  He lives in his own house with his family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nHe left Namaacha for Boane on a service mission; later he set up his home and established residence in Boane.  He has worked as a teacher for more than 10 years, and in addition to his job he has his own business, which helps him with household expenses.  He earns about 3,500 meticais, with about 3,000 more coming from his business.  He uses the money to cover household expenses and also manages to save some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nErnesto has never taken out loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 20,000 meticais to buy products (beer, soft drinks, sugar, rice, wine and other products) to increase and diversify his inventory.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he can take out others.  In the future, he would like to ask for more loans to buy a vehicle and solve the transportation problems he faces while transporting his merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Lauben is a 50-year-old married father of seven boisterous schoolchildren. To shoulder his responsibility of providing for them he has, over the course of the last six years, been operating a coffee produce shop in Rwerere Trading centre, Rukungiri District.\r\n\r\nLauben\u2019s business has not been without setbacks since he began; he has had to bear a myriad of challenges, such as the lack of steady income.

Of these seven children, four are studying, one remains in the village, and two other children are not studying, since they are not yet of school age.\u00a0 Her husband is a bus driver (intercity).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nRiziki started her small business with her own funds received from her husband.\u00a0 Her initial capital amounted to $50.\u00a0 Her business involves selling fish (smoked, salted, or fresh) in the small market in the TMK district.\u00a0 She has been in this business of selling fish for ten years.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith the loan from the micro-finance institution Hekima, she wishes to increase her sales by buying two baskets of smoked fish called \"moshi\", six loads of salted fish called \"makayabo\", and thirty fresh fish called \"mbichi mbichi\".\u00a0 She also has a small practice as a traditional healer (who administers care based on medicinal plants), and she braids hair to increase her income.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn the future, Riziki would prefer to switch from selling fish, since she has sometimes experienced losses from rotten fish due to the lack of cold storage for keeping her goods and sometimes due to the lack electricity for the refrigerator.\u00a0 She remains optimistic by emphasizing that, to switch businesses, she needs 2,000 in capital, which she plans on having one day.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nRiziki expresses her thanks to the MFI Hekima for the loans she receives with no need for any collateral at all because, thanks to these loans, she is managing to provide for her children.\r\n\r\nThis group, Neema, is composed of seven members, most of whom are women.\u00a0<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva
