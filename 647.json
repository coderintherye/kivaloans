end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a products store where he sells sugar, flour, butter, rice, pasta and other miscellaneous products. When he first received a loan from IMON International, he made a good profit and the loan was useful to him. With the previous loan he received, he grew his business and improved his quality of life. Now, he wants to receive another loan to buy a new assortment of food products with the goal of expanding his business and working capital. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The happy-go-lucky mother of four says her business has been in the running with customers as well as seeing profits increasing.\r\nSusan has however had her fair share of adversity. On many occasions, she has been running short on drug supplies at her pharmacy. What in most cases compounds her problem is the lack of capital to purchase more drugs to resell. She says, however, when there are enough drugs at her pharmacy, she rides high on sales income. Susan says she set forth in this business after medical school. On the side, she ekes out a side income from a small farming business.

The cooking time for the fish varies depending on the size of the fish and their arrangement in the oven. \r\nThe most important thing about this process is that it is the smoke, not the fire, that cooks the fish. The smoke gives the fish its dark color. Green leaves are used as coverings for the fish to prevent the smoke from escaping into the air. The heat should also be moderate as too much heat would not allow the fish to cook properly.\r\n\r\nCape Coast is a town in the Central Region of Ghana that is known to be a fishing community.

Many people are taking a liking for this business because one is assured of money from rent payments from tenants at the end of every month. This business is mostly a roaring trade in the urban areas where many people are moving. Currently, however, many of the individuals involved in this kind of business have been grumbling about a recently introduced property tax that they have to pay each month. Most of the landlords are facing a scenario where many clients are looking for cheaper options given the tough economic status quo.\r\n\r\nGeorge, 61 years old, has been in the rentals business for the past 17 years. He says most of them have been looking for a quick fix for the problems they face but to little avail. George, a down-to-earth father of six, says, despite that, many landlords like himself are still able to live within the ways and means of their businesses. Seventeen years of experience in this business have taught George much about how to be successful. He says he banked on savings from his farming business to take root in the business. On the side, George also ekes out additional income from a modest mattress sales enterprise that he began seven years ago.\r\n\r\nMonthly, George says his business generates him income to the tune of 300,000 Ugandan shillings. He says that he intends to utilize this Kiva loan to purchase bags of cement, sand and other construction materials for the construction of two self-contained rooms for rent in Jinja, in the east of Uganda in East Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":839893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase bags of cement, sand and other construction materials for the construction of two self-contained rooms for rent in Jinja.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-08-09T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rashida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mutesi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hasfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maureen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saleh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Munusa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sulaiman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":12100000,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3025000},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3025000},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3025000},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3025000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1143.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1143.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1143.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1143.75,"local_amount":3025000,"processed_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3030937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232875404,"comment":null},{"amount":1143.75,"local_amount":3025000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3030937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868635,"comment":null},{"amount":1143.71,"local_amount":3024900,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3030837.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648474,"comment":null},{"amount":1082.06,"local_amount":2861850,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2867467.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313818,"comment":null},{"amount":61.73,"local_amount":163250,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":163570.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275574,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-18T06:44:04Z","paid_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":324219,"name":"Maria Luzmila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Luzmila tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera, vive con sus padres  e hijo de 12 a\u00f1os en el Cant\u00f3n Chillanes, Provincia de Bol\u00edvar. \n\nLa V.R.C NUEVE DE ABRIL, se encuentra ubicada en la parroquia  San Jos\u00e9 del Tambo, perteneciente al cant\u00f3n Chillanes, los miembros de esta ventanilla se dedican a la agricultura, principalmente al cultivo de ma\u00edz y cacao.\n\nMar\u00eda se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y cacao.

Express Auto and Body Paint, because he wanted to provide reliable service to his community while providing secure employment to its hard-working members. Before opening his shop, Raul worked as the manager of the paint department at a large auto shop. However, after being forced to lay off many of the employees under his charge, Raul decided to go out on his own. \r\n\r\nA.R.C. Express Auto opened in September 2010 and offers its customers any auto body service from dent repair to complete paint jobs. Raul used his 10 years of experience, including time working with the U.S. Army, to start the business. He hired and receives ongoing support from three of the employees laid off by his old employer, including an old manager who helps Raul estimate paint and labor costs. \r\n\r\nRaul says his biggest success to date has been keeping the business open and successful while navigating a confusing city-permit process, which nearly led to the close of his shop. Of this, he says, \u201cIn order to keep your business legal, you need to get the right city permits. I would call in and get a different answer from each person regarding these permits. Ultimately, I had to pay someone to figure it out for me because I couldn\u2019t start the shop and engage in that process at the same time.\u201d  Since he started the shop with his personal finances, he said that the strain caused by this added necessity nearly forced him to shut down the business.\r\n\r\nHowever, his loan from Kiva partner ACCION Texas-Louisiana helped Raul overcome this difficulty. He used the loan to make payroll, pay for paint and supplies, and pay off a mortgage on some land, which has since been sold and the money brought back to his business. Without the loan, Raul says, \u201cI would have had to shut down the shop. ACCION Texas helped me see the options available to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the future, Raul hopes to stay true to his community-oriented business policy. He says, \u201cMy goal is to hire some disabled veterans and people with disabilities and give back to the community. My goal is not to get rich; I want to give people a workplace where they come in, enjoy what they do, and go home happy.\u201d  He says that one day he hopes to open another establishment, such as a dance hall, that community organizations can use at an affordable price for recreational functions.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a year in business, Raul offers the following advice to aspiring business owners: \u201cMake sure you do your homework, and, most importantly, make sure you engage with your customers and the people who affect your business face-to-face.\u201d  With this loan, Raul was able to overcome the initial challenges of opening his business. Now, he can continue to give members of his community a secure job that provides reliable, quality services to the residents of El Paso.

Latacunga is known for its chilly weather and the presence of nearby Volcano Cotopaxi, an active volcano that has repeatedly damaged the city during eruptions.\r\n\r\nThis is Alba's first Kiva loan. She will use it to buy cooking utensils and food for her snack stall, which she runs by herself. She makes and sells french fries, coffee, and \"bolones de verde,\" a traditional Ecuadorian dish made of mashed green bananas and varying types of meat. Since she was little, her mother and sister helped her learn to cook. She works five or six hours a day and hopes that by increasing her working hours and through her loan with Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she can increase her income and her quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":529.83,"image":{"id":838848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cooking utensils and food for \"El Clasico Snack\" stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2011-08-09T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Jackeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":623.52,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":80.29},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":87.81},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":93.02},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":94.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.48,"local_amount":80.29,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":80.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036368,"comment":null},{"amount":86.68,"local_amount":86.47,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":86.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608233,"comment":null},{"amount":88.01,"local_amount":87.81,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T08:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":88.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562576,"comment":null},{"amount":89.96,"local_amount":89.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":89.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773665,"comment":null},{"amount":91.46,"local_amount":91.25,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":91.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182214,"comment":null},{"amount":93.24,"local_amount":93.02,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":93.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316863,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T15:06:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":324245,"name":"Rigoberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rigoberto, vive con sus hijos y su esposa, se dedica a brindar servicio de taxi, tiene casi 6 a\u00f1os de estar brindando este servicio, trabaja todos los d\u00edas de 5:00am a 7:00pm, surgi\u00f3 por iniciativa propia y ya cuenta con clientes frecuentes.\nEl est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para dar mantenimiento al taxi, ya que debe llevarlo al mec\u00e1nico a reparar el sistema el\u00e9ctrico, luego el cambio de placas, que significa incurrir en gastos, este pr\u00e9stamo le ayudara para tener en buenas condiciones el veh\u00edculo y trabajar con mayores seguridad.\nLa aspiraci\u00f3n de Rigoberto es que su familia tenga una vida estable en mejores condiciones.\n","en":"Rigoberto lives with his children and wife and devotes himself to providing taxi services.

She lives in her own home with her husband and five children, for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life and a good education for their future.  Pilar has a business renting out bicycles.  Normally, she waits at home for children and adults who are looking to have a little bit of fun and healthy exercise.  Some of them may need a mode of transportation.  Pilar has 10 bicycles for rent and most of her customers are school-age children.  What she likes most about her job is that she always has customers and can be at home so that she is near her children.  The part that she dislikes is whenever the children fall off the bicycles or damage them because she has to pay for replacement parts.   Nonetheless, she continues to persevere because this business generates sufficient income for her to cover basic household needs.  Her husband engages in other activities.

She is a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. Her husband is Victor, a cook. She is a mother to her three children. Her eldest child is in college and the youngest is staying at home.  She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nElvira operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Elvira earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located inside her house. At the same time, she earns additional income by sewing or repairing clothes and pants. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvira hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muharam is a teacher and she teaches at the primary school. Her salary is not enough for her family, so she decided to begin sewing.  Muharam has been making traditional clothes for more than ten years.  She learned how to sew from a relative, and now easily copes by herself. When she goes to school to work, her daughter and daughter-in-law continue sewing. Muharam would like to receive a loan for $1,000 to buy fabric to sew clothes and sell them for a good price.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is Anita, 40, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. Her husband is Frederick, a warehouse man. She is a mother to her four children. Her eldest child is in college and the youngest is in elementary school.  She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nAnita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Anita earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 21,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnita hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":840781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":21000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5321.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005376,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4434.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764544,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3547.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571665,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3547.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529217,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4434.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738464,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-15T20:32:58Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":324547,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a married woman with two children, both of whom attend school.

That statement should be taken with a grain of salt. It may be a little farfetched, but one can\u2019t rule out the fact that indeed some entrepreneurs did get some business training.\r\n\r\nA study carried out recently showed how some business people are nodding acquaintances when it comes to efficiently operating businesses. That proficiency is lacking, but still most businesses, however petty they are, are making headway. This has puzzled most business experts, but it is the status quo that we are all bearing witness to.\r\n\r\nIf the above, particularly the part that talks about the fact that most people lack business training, is referenced to 42-year-old Kate, an assiduous clothes sales business entrepreneur plying her trade in Jinja, it could hold water. It\u2019s now 15 grueling and chequered years in this business for Kate, who at her age has no kids yet.\r\n\r\nShe says being devoid of business skills has not played havoc with any of her operations, though she says if she had got the training, she probably would be operating her business in a more worthwhile and proficient way.\r\n\r\nHer maiden business was a retail shop and Kate says she utilized her savings to set forth in her cloth sales trade. However, she has not dispensed with her retail shop. She still operates it, though she has delegated the responsibilities of running it to her sister.\r\n\r\nShe says this business's monthly sales income totals up to 150,000 Ugandan shillings. This is the fourth time Kate's group is taking a loan from Pearl microfinance and their track record in repayments has been good.\r\n\r\nKate says she reckons that with this Kiva loan she will purchase more clothes, principally men's clothes, to resell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":840763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Vivian earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \n\nVivian hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Juanito, a tricycle driver, and a mother of two children who already have their own families. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. \r\n\r\nElvira operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. \r\n\r\nThis is not only a typical family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. \r\n\r\nHer regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 750 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more  products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvira dreams to make this store a mini-grocery.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
