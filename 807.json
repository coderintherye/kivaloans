She learned the work of preparing and managing food when she worked as an employee in the restaurant that her mother had in the public market.  That same restaurant was given to Nilda by her mother because her mom began to have health problems.  With her restaurant she has had many challenges that she has had to face, like the times when the metro stop was under construction and her sales went down.  For that reason she had to restructure and locate the business in her own home.  Currently her business is growing and each day her customer base increases.  With her earnings she supports the family expenses along with her husband who is an independent stationary contractor.  Her Kiva credit is the first financing that she has received through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, a Kiva field partner.  With the loan she will purchase tables, plastic chairs, fans, and a freezer.  This infrastructure will help her keep her customers comfortable so that they will return and become faithful clients.  Her goal is to have sufficient capital from permanent work to be able to support her business and in the future buy her own home.

Her business is located in front of a school, and she offers her customers items that they really need.

Her husband was born in the municipality of Sabanagrande in the department of Atl\u00e1ntico where she is well known for her informal way of interacting with those she knows. Because of this, when she decided to offer her services to the public four years ago, she did it in the municipality where she's from and things have gone well for her. Nowadays she lives very near to the sea, scenery which inspires her with creativity hand in hand with her husband and their two children that are between the ages of 9 and 10 years old. The services she mainly offers are to mend dresses, dress shirts, and female skirts, and to a lesser extent makes a living making garments. Her plans include making her shop bigger, adding sewing machines, and hiring an employee that will support its growth. Currently her work capital is not enough to have this goal succeed and for this reason she turned to a Kiva loan. Also, this is the first financing she has done with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this she will buy a sewing machine and an overlock sewing machine.

She lives in her own house, which is located in a village of the District of Tambogrande, belonging to the Piura region. It is a four-hour drive from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the department of Lambayeque. Mary lives in the rural part of this district, and only benefits from basic electrical services.\r\n\r\nOver the past ten years Mary dedicated herself to raising small livestock such as pigs and poultry (chickens and turkeys), breeding, fattening and then selling them at the local market. Her husband is a farmer with one hectare of land (approximately 2.5 acres) where he grows limes that he harvests weekly. With the income earned from this activity he is able to cover his expenses and those of his family.\r\n\r\nMary has had problems with her livestock due to the constant raining in the area. She needs to put roofing over the livestock breeding pens, in order to protect them from the elements and keep them from dying because of weather conditions. To achieve this goal she decided to apply for a loan of 2000 soles.\r\n\r\nMary and her husband support each other, facing family expenses together and caring for their children. There is a good family relationship, which helps them to keep expanding their business activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":772556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Roof her pens to protect her livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-03-15T11:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-14T11:30:03Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Fidencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":141.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":138.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":152.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":152},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":155.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":165.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":167.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":173.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":185.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":191.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":196.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:27:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402625,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\r\n\r\nEkua cooks banku to sell.

She has been running a store in her home for several years.  Her store is in a very strategic location which is very busy with people.  Mar\u00eda's neighbors provide good references for her as she is a charming, hard-working and responsible woman.  In addition, many people prefer to buy from her because she has a good range of products in her store and sells them at the best prices.  Mar\u00eda has taken the decision to invest in merchandise for her store so that she can attract more customers to buy her products.  She decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL in order to make this investment and buy rice, beans, oil, milk, coffee, sweet bread, candies, detergents and other products that will attract more customers.  In this way she hopes to improve her family's quality of life as well as her own.

In the mornings she tends to the household chores and also watches over her small store.

","en":"Mukadaskhan is 37 years old, married, and raising three children, of which the youngest one is in kindergarten. Mukadaskhan is a seamstress by education, which helped her when she in 2008, in search of a source of income for her family, started sewing her own products for selling. \r\n\r\nIn the course of time, Mukadaskhan expanded the range of products, also selling things by purchasing finished products of children's clothing and lingerie. Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, Mukadaskhan was able to develop her business to a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nToday the assortment of products is not abundant, and for this reason, Mukadaskhan turned to the company \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to expand the range of spring clothing. Mukadaskhan plans to use part of the income to repair her apartment and the rest to develop her business"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1035822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to broaden the assortment of spring clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkiya town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-16T00:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-15T00:10:05Z","loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukadaskhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5891},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5969},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6113},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6261},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6412},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6567},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6726},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6888},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7055},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7225},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7400},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7493}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.53},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-25T18:25:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403014,"name":"Sha'migul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0428\u0430\u044a\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u0415\u0439 46 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0414\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0435\u0435 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0428\u0430\u044a\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0442\u0438\u0446. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0443\u0440 \u0438 \u0446\u044b\u043f\u043b\u044f\u0442.

","en":"Yinarbubu is 54 years old, a widow and has three children. Yinarbubu does animal husbandry as a source of income for her family. She started her business in 1991 with 1,000 som (KGS) which now brings her around 8,000 som a month from the sale of milk and dairy products.

The produce he grows provides his family with money for the children's education, household needs and to save. His wife raises pigs at home; they have been doing that for 17 years, ever since they were married. Currently, he already has 10 fattening pigs and 4 sows. This effort was undertaken jointly with his wife. They already have considerable experience in terms of raising pigs and have gotten satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nOne constraint is waste generated in the form of pig manure. I Putu Gede has taken the manure to the farm for organic fertilizer, but that was not enough to cope. Hearing of the biogas program, he immediately joined.
