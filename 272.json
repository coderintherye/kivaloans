Punsal is 58 years-old and lives with her husband and two children in Uvurkhangai province in central Mongolia. Her husband is retired and her two children are in college. Her family moved to Uvurkhangai seven years ago and they live together in a one room apartment.\r\n<p>\r\nPunsal operates a ger (a monogolian nomadic felt tent) camp in the yard of her apartment building. Her business serves the many tourists and travelers that pass through her province. In 2004, Punsal started her business by building a ger and fencing in the yard around her apartment building. Her business found success and she expanded by building five more gers. She stays very busy during the summer tourist season, but her business dies down in the winter and she stores three of her gers.  Punsal hopes to expand her business in the future. Her oldest daughter is currently finishing her final course to become a tourism specialist.

At the moment, only their youngest child is still studying. \n\nAt present Rosalyn manages a hog raising business. The business is of big help in providing the needs of their family and their youngest child who is currently studying in college. She wanted to borrow a loan from KIVA lenders amounting to PHP10, 000 in order to buy enough supply of feeds for her hog raising business. \n\nRosalyn aims to become a successful hog raiser to uplift the living condition of her family. She enjoys doing her business and it really makes her happy seeing the daily development of her hogs.  She just hopes that lenders grant her loan request.

They live in an agriculture-based community where farming is the main source of income. Rice and corn are the main crops which they produce twice a year.\r\n\r\nWanting to help her husband in supporting the needs of their family, Elsa decided to engage in a direct-selling business. Through this, she has been able to provide the school allowances of their children.\r\n\r\nElsa is hoping that she will be able to obtain a loan of PHP 10,000 from Kiva lenders that will be utilized as additional capital for her direct-selling business. She sells Avon and Natasha cosmetics products in their town. She purchases the products in the town proper of Solana and earns an income on a commission

She is 44 years old, divorced, and has three children between the ages of 7 and 24, who all attend school.  She attended school until the 9th grade when she dropped out due to pregnancy.  She lives in a home given to her by her parents, with her mother and children.  She separated from her husband after the birth of of her youngest son, age 3. She grew up with both of her parents and only left when she had to go to her home in Boane.  Before working she had small businesses. \r\n\r\nShe works for a humanitarian organization focused on HIV\/AIDS called PFUCANE (which means Wake Up in the local language) as a community facilitator.  She earns 4.500,00MT and has been working there for more than 3 years. \r\n\r\nShe had a loan with Procredito bank for an unspecified amount that was used for the purchase of construction materials.  At the end of the loan, she decided not to continue with that bank due to inflexible payment options.  This is her first loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, for 20.000,00MT to be used to purchase construction materials for a concrete house that has already been started (cement, blocks, sand, nails, etc.).  She plans to pay the loan back without any problems so that she can have access to future loans with the goal of finishing her house.  She dreams of seeing her home finished to provide comfort for her children and to later be able to equip\/furnish it.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

They will use part of their profit to reinvest in their businesses and part of it to provide for their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":385827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101826.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028372,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50913.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873698,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50913.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763410,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-26T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50913.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152224,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50913.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991111,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-05T17:56:47Z","paid_date":"2010-03-18T08:49:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135848,"name":"Estrella Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ignacia M.

Ignacia M. S. (in the red blouse) is 44 years old and returned to school where she finished her training as a technical nurse.  She also has a vending stall where she sells products grown by her family.  Do\u00f1a Ignacia is in a common law marriage with Sr. Juan Miguel Mart\u00ednez, who also sells fruits and vegetables.  They have 3 children, two in elementary school and the other in high school.  She lives at Avenue 4 Lot 35 in the Moctezuma settlement of the city of Orizaba VeraC..  Do\u00f1a Ignacia tells us that her community is peaceful and well managed, and that most of the residents have their own businesses.  It is one of the oldest settlements in the city of Orizaba and has a rich tradition as well as a great atmosphere that prevails throughout the community.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Ignacia learned about Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through friends and was encouraged to organize a group, which was named \u201cEstrella\u201d (Star).  She saw this was a great opportunity to grow her business because she wanted to add groceries to the products she offers.  She will use her loan to buy fruit (apples, bananas, pears, and oranges), vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, onions, potatoes, carrots, and lettuce), and groceries (oil, rice, paper, soap, and mayonnaise).  \r\n<p>\r\nThe \u201cEstrella\u201d Group is composed of 10 women who have been friends for a long time and meet on the weekends.  They are requesting a loan so that they can improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.  Most of them sell products by catalog, but others sell clothing, snacks, and natural yogurt.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Ignacia is very pleased with her loan because she will be able to offer a variety of fruits, vegetables and groceries and give her customers more choices.  She will be able to get better returns which will enable her to repay her loan and improve the quality of life for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dream of Do\u00f1a Ignacia is to provide for her children so that they can finish their studies.  She hopes to have her own vending location so that she can increase her earnings and expand her business by selling chickens.  She is grateful to Kiva for helping ordinary people who are complete strangers.  The assistance provided to these women help them have their own businesses and improve the quality of life for their families.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":384834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase fruits, vegetables, and groceries to offer a variety of products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Veracruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-09-10T23:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca Clara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Hipolita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":37000,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":346.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":346.87},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.87},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.87},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":346.88,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87040238,"comment":null},{"amount":346.87,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4637.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87040239,"comment":null},{"amount":346.88,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952638,"comment":null},{"amount":346.87,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952639,"comment":null},{"amount":924.06,"local_amount":12320.84,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12353.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794796,"comment":null},{"amount":116.57,"local_amount":1554.16,"processed_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1558.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685956,"comment":null},{"amount":346.87,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685957,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-12T18:38:52Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135849,"name":"Constantina","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Constantina tiene 59 a\u00f1os, vive con su hermana en su casa propia.

He prefers a loan from GHAPE because it includes training before the loan is disbursed and proper follow-up to ensure proper use of the loan.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

M. is 62 years old and lives in the Usquil district of Otuzco Province, La Libertad, Peru. She is divorced and is a member of the Cachanchugo II Communal Bank. She stayed in school only until grade 6 because at a young age she began working in the fields. She became pregnant at age 17 and had a daughter who no longer lives with her.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of  family problems, Maximina left her home town with her young children, and since then has lived in Cachanchugo. She is separated from her second marriage. In spite of the pain and sadness of her family situation, she persevered, along with her children. When she arrived in Cachanchugo, she worked as a contract agricultural laborer. She began with planting, and later began caring for guinea pigs as well. Little by little, she was able to raise her five children who now are independent and give her economic and moral support.\r\n<p>\r\nMaximina now works planting corn in nearby farms but, because of health problems, she has recently not been able to work. With her first loan of 300 soles, Maximina bought guinea pigs and started into the business of raising them. With this loan of 400 soles ($150), she will till and fertilize her land for a new crop of lentils and corn. Maximina anxiously awaits the harvest, which will be within six months, because with her earnings she will be able to save some money.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":382841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Tilling and fertilizing land for a new crop of lentils and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-09T21:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074973,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990347,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835331,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":109.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T23:54:45Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135874,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mary, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres Decididas\u201d, Distrito de Tarapoto, Provincia San Martin, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

Celinda A. A. is 45 years old and lives in the District of Usquil, Otuzco Province, Department of La Libertad - Per\u00fa.  This entrepreneur completed her studies through the 5th year of secondary school.  She is a single mother and a member of the Communal Bank \u201cCachanchugo II\u201d.\r\n<p>\r\nShe wanted to study nursing after she finished high school, but her father denied her the opportunity and asked her to engage in farming.  However, she decided to travel to Trujillo to get a job and pay for educational expenses on her own.  She arrived in Trujillo at the age of 19 and worked for an Italian family as a nanny for 3 years.  After she turned 21, she fell in love with the father of her child.  He did not want to take responsibility for her or the baby after she became pregnant, so she returned to her hometown of Cachanchugo and started working on the farm.  She began breeding guinea pigs and learned how to weave reeds grown in the area to make purses, seat covers, mats, hats, etc.\r\n<p>\r\nCelinda spends her time weaving reeds and also recruits other young women to increase production making purses, satchels, bags, and hats to sell in the city of Cajamarca.

Through her volunteer work with the genealogy library in Oakland, California, Helen discovered that a large number of people had an interest in exploring their ancestry. Given this demand, as well as her own personal interest in genealogy, Helen founded \u201cMy Genealogy\u201d in order to provide family history research services. The business provides her with the supplement to her social security income that she needs.\r\n\r\nHelen needs a $2,000 loan to purchase an all-in-one printer, copier, scanner and fax; a used computer; subscriptions to online databases for genealogists; and a desk for her part-time employee.

Having fully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC, she is now requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers. This loan will be her second from GDMPC, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for the tuition fees of her children and the family's daily needs. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<p>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

But she needed capital to start, and this is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002.\r\n\r\nAfter getting her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she started a food-vending business and a coffee shop adjacent to her house. The tasty meals she offered soon became popular in the community and her business continues to flourish. This nets a profit of PHP 5,000 per month, which has helped a lot in covering the family's daily expenses.\r\n\r\nErlinda just repaid the last installment on her 17th loan of PHP 18,000 and now she is applying to borrow PHP 20,000 to invest back into her business.

B. has been a member of Kiva partner, ASHI, for a year. When she became a member, she accessed a loan that she used to finance a food vending business she manages herself, and a rice farming business managed by her farm laborer husband. After paying off the first loan from ASHI in six months, Danelda is now requesting a much larger loan that she will use to finance her husband\u2019s fishing business. She wants to purchase a fishing boat for her husband and start up a hog-fattening (pig-raising) business. \r\n<p>\r\nAside from rice farming and food vending, Danelda\u2019s husband\u2019s fishing business has been a large source of the family\u2019s daily income and has enabled Danelda to save for her weekly payment to ASHI. Nevertheless, a hog-fattening business could also enrich their income since this business can yield as much as double the amount of its capital in profit once the hog is sold live, or slaughtered and sold per kilo, after every four months of fattening.\r\n<p>\r\nDanelda has to have many sources of income because she has seven children to nurture and support.  These children range in age from 7 to 23 years old. Five of her eldest children have stopped studying because of the family's very poor financial situation. With loans from ASHI, Danelda wants to grow sources of income to meet the needs of her children and enable them to go back to school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":386194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a

They have four children: nine-year-old Jodielyn, seven-year-old Shanely Ann Jane, Anthony Mark Louise and Ashley Rhell Jade. \r\n<p>\r\nOne part of the family\u2019s income comes from Jodie\u2019s farming. They run a variety store selling daily necessities as well. Sometimes, however, Jodie works as a fisherman, but this pursuit is not very profitable. Not owning any fishing gear, he must borrow the equipment, which comes at a price: even though he may work hard out on the ocean, the one who owns the borrowed fishing gear demands a larger percentage than Jodie receives of the day\u2019s take.\r\n<p>\r\nSo Bebelyn is requesting a second loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI). With this loan she will buy fishing gear, including a Robin boat motor, nylon rope and other things needed to start their own fishing business. Bebelyn will also help her husband sell their fish. This way Jodie and she will receive 100% in profits from the day\u2019s catch. \r\n<p>\r\nBebelyn would also like to use the loan to increase the items available at her variety store such as canned goods, cooking oil, refined sugar, detergent and other groceries. The variety store was Bebelyn\u2019s idea so they could increase their income to meet everyday expenses and the cost of educating her four children.

is married and lives in Ntabese Nkwen, a quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon.  She has six children, three of whom are below fifteen years in age.  Crescentia sells scourge eggs and cooked food in a private secondary school during lunch hour. With this loan, she plans to buy flour, eggs and other ingredients to make the food she sells. She has faced hardship and numerous challenges in life, such as the death of her first son and second daughter.  There was a time when her entire family was sick. She has also lost two brothers who were very supportive of her and helped her take care of her family. <p>\r\n \r\nCrescentia has been a member of GHAPE since 2005, and this will be her fourth loan.  She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location, the quality of her food, and her reasonable prices.  She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales.  Part of the profits from this loan will be used towards school fees for her children. The rest will be used for medication and for feeding her large family. She does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments, as they are quite small repayments every two weeks.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards empowerment of the poor, and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account. Most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff, and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

V. D. C. is a 50-year-old widow and the mother of eight children who range in age from six to 27 years old. Her eldest daughter, who has been working abroad, supports her financially and enables her to support the rest of her children, who are dependent on her for their everyday lives. \r\n\r\nTo augment her daughter\u2019s income abroad, early in 2009, Elsie joined ASHI to have access to credit for business capital. Then she opened a variety store. With the profits from her store, she was able to repay her loan on time. \r\n\r\nNow Elsie is requesting another loan from ASHI, which she will use to expand her store and start a new hog-raising business. In the hog business, the profit is as much as double the amount of the initial capital investment when the hogs are sold after months of fattening. So, the more pigs that Elsie can raise and sell, the more profits she will earn. Someday, through the loans she can access from ASHI, Elsie hopes that her business will grow and become profitable enought for her to be able to support all of her children. \r\n\r\nFor now, she has to support the education of her three younger children in high school and elementary school. She hopes that all three will be able to graduate from college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":386298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To finance

En el caso de los c\u00edtricos, la mayor inversi\u00f3n es el fumigado contra los mosquitos, en este caso, en los meses de enero a marzo los env\u00eda a un mercado de la ciudad de Lima donde le cotizan a un buen precio y eso le causa mucha alegr\u00eda. Por ello est\u00e1 planeando comprar otras tierras donde pueda incrementar sus cultivos. \nEste es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, es por ello que renueva su compromiso de pagar puntualmente todas sus cuotas y de ese modo no perjudicar a su banco comunal. Con el dinero que solicita comprar\u00e1 abono para sus cultivos de pl\u00e1tano y los c\u00edtricos.

She is 43, and she has five children who are 23, 21, 19, 17, and 14.  Her oldest child is outside of the country.  He migrated to the exterior to give his family a better future.  Her second daughter is married and making her own home.  Only three of her children live in her home.  One of her daughters enrolled this year in the State University of Cuenca.  Her two last children study in the T\u00e9cnico Tur\u00ed school.  She has been divorced for four years, and they live in their own home.\r\n\r\nGladis raises small animals like chickens and guinea pigs.  She also does the household chores.  She has been raising animals for six years, and it is going very well.  She tells us that the earnings are dependent upon how much is invested.  And that can vary because not all of the chickens are raised, some die.  But, she is happy because this business supports her household.\r\n\r\nThis is her second cycle working with the Foundation, although she did withdraw for a while.  The money that she gets now from the ESPOIR Foundation will be used for food for the chickens (ground, balanced) and the guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to keep growing with her business of raising animals and giving her children a better today and tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTania Paola M. C. is also an active member of the Turi Centro Bank.  She lives in the Centro de Tur\u00ed in the viewpoint of Cuenca.  She is 30 and happily married.  Her three children; 12, 9, and 7, are testaments to their love.  Her oldest child goes to the Miguel Merch\u00e1n school.  The last two goes to the Pr\u00edncipe de Paz school.  Her husband works as a carpenter.  Being her friend, they are inseperable in the moments of pain and happiness.  They rent where they live because they do not have the money to buy or build their own house.\r\n\r\nTania studied tailoring and passed to the second year.  She sells clothes two day a week.  On Wednesdays she sells in the free marked in a space her mother gives her.  On Saturday she buys all her clothing stock for her business.  One of her biggest difficulties is not having her own place.  She has to inconvenience her mother a little bit.  The advantage is that working with her mother she knows lots of people, and she gets new customers each time.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking the foundation for is to buy merchandise to increase her business and to have a large stock for her demanding customers.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to be a tailoring teacher and to continue with her clothing business.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Patricia is another active member of the Turi Centro Communal Bank.  She was previously a member of another bank that broke up.  She is 39, and she has been separated for seven years.  She lives with her four children.  Her ex husband gives her child support only when her remembers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth works in the market on Thursdays and Sundays selling a great variety of fruit.  She starts at six in the morning and works until nine at night.  She has been doing this for five years.  The rest of the week she devotes to her home.  The greatest difficulty she has is when sales drop and she barely gets enough money to cover the debts that she owes.  When sales are good, she gets income to invest in her business and for the daily sustenance of her household.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth cycle working with the ESPOIR Foundation.  She previously was a member of another communal bank that broke up.  The money she is asking for is to buy more fruit to better stock and improve her stand because there is a lot of competition.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s dream for the future is to succeed in her business and to be able to educate her children until they become good professionals.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He is married, and he lives with his wife and their two daughters in the \u201cPueblo Joven\u201d (nickname for a shanty town) Atusparias in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district.  It is located five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has been working close to 15 years in a small shoe repair stand.

Due to the constant demand for his services, he stays there very late.\r\n\r\nHis business is the only source of income for his family.  Therefore, every day he puts forth maximum effort to get ahead in his business.  He is asking our institution for a loan for 600 PEN, which he plans to use to buy the necessary materials like thread, dyes, insoles, and soles, etc.\r\n\r\nHis biggest desire is to buy a \u201cmototaxi\u201d (a motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers), which would give him an extra daily income.  This way he could give his family a greater economic stability like giving his daughters the opportunity to have some type of post high school education.\r\n\r\nTito has previously worked with us, and he has demonstrated responsibility and punctuality in his payments.
