She has four adult children who are 24 to 32 years old. Two of her children were able to finish college, the third also went to college but stopped. They already have their own families. The youngest is a high school graduate and now works in a factory in Manila and also sends money home. Regina earns a living by running her small general store. \r\n\r\nRegina's general store has been supplementing her family's income for over thirty years. With her husband's income, the general store's earnings provided for the extras that her family needed; the family totally depended on her husband's income.\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of her husband five years ago left the family bereft and at a loss. The drastic drop in their family income pushed Regina to increase her income potential. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 - so that she could get additional capital to expand the operations of her general store so that she could increase her income, enough to support her family.\r\n\r\nWith the cooperation of her children and her own efforts, Regina survived that crisis and, with the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, and five years later, Regina is now able to earn PHP 9,000 from her general store - which is enough to support her household expenses and stay independent.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan she borrowed Php 19,500 that she used as additional working capital for her general store. She paid off that loan in weekly installments for a set period without any delays until she was able to fully repay the principal amount. Now she is borrowing for her 13th loan the same amount of Php 19,500 which she intends to invest in expanding her business. The income from it will be used as savings for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nRegina is very thankful because she is given an opportunity to improve her life with the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon and with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ because He gives her the strength and courage to face the trials in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

G. lives in the village of Tabao 13, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. Her one big dream is to improve her family's standard of living, to have enough capital to expand her business, and to prepare her four children for a better future. Her dream started to become a reality when she became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nEmelinda is 52 years old and is married to Artimio G., who helps her manage their business. They have four children, aged 22 to 29 years old. Two of their children already have their own families and the other two still live at home -- one works as a seaman and other is a student.\r\n\r\nEmelinda and Artimio started out selling pork to retail customers. They bought pigs and had them butchered, and then her husband delivered the pork meat to various meat shops on consignment. This earns them a good living, but they are always on the lookout for other business opportunities, so in 2000 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and opened a new business selling spare parts and electronic gadgets. \r\n\r\nThey continued with their pork retail business, earning a combined monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). They use their income to support their household expenses and pay for school tuition, and they have some left over for savings. Emelinda had a previous loan of 29,500 PHP, which she used for both her spare parts and her pork retail business. She repaid this loan in full within its loan term and without any delays. She is now borrowing for her 23rd cycle the same amount of 29,500 PHP. She will use this loan as additional working capital and to purchase additional spare parts inventory. \r\n\r\nIn the accompanying picture, Emelinda is shown in her spare parts and electronics business with her husband in the background.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. This is Project Dungganon.

S. was already a retired teacher when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. She is 64 years old and is retired from her teaching profession but is still very active. She is married to Angelo S., Jr. and they currently operate their own business producing feed out of cassava mixed with some ingredients.  They also make cassava chips, cassava granules and even cassava powder. The couple have 4 children, 2 are already married and 2 are still single and they have 3 grandchildren. They live in Marietta Village, Brgy. Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nHer immediate dream is to be able to buy a new machine that will enable them to produce cassava chips and other cassava-based food products more easily.\r\n\t\r\nIn business one must be a step ahead in terms of strategies and technology. To stay ahead, Letty and her husband needed additional capital, which is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001. With the infusion of new capital, they were able to survive stiff competition and Letty also supplemented their family income by selling appliances on commission basis as a sideline. With the help of the loans, they were able to expand their operations and even expanded their product distribution to other areas, getting regular customers as far as the province of Iloilo.\r\n\r\nPreviously, she borrowed Php 29,000 to use as additional capital for her business and as usual the loan was fully paid in full and on time. This contributed to her maintaining her good credit performance. Now for her 18th cycle loan she intends to borrow the same amount of Php 29,000 for her business of producing feeds and cassava-based products. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture shows Letecia and her husband in their business site with some of their cassava inventory packed in sacks. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":414200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

D. is a hardworking mother and a good entrepreneur who is always looking for a great opportunity to earn more for her family and for the education of her children. She lives in the village of Prk Paraiso, Brgy Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She is 56 years old and married. Her husband, Rafael D., manages their 1.25-hectare rice farm. He also helps Leonora run their other business ventures. Together, Rafael and Leonora have 5 children, 3 of whom are already married. The other 2 are still single and live at home. Leonora has 5 grandchildren. \r\n\r\nLeonora buys and sells rice because rice production is prevalent in their community. Her trading business was earning her a good income, but when the opportunity to join NWTF-Project Dungganon came, she did not hesitate, and expanded her business activities to include pig fattening in 2001. Leonora treated this new business as a way to secure additional income. Every time she sold a hog, she would save a portion of the proceeds in her emergency fund. She also used the income to pay for her children's tuition. With the added income from hog-raising she was able to earn an average monthly income of 30,000 Philippine pesos, or about $630 US, good income that provides a comfortable living for her family.\r\n\r\nBecause Leonora is a responsible businesswoman, repays loans well, is very responsible and has good leadership qualities, she was elected as a center chief by other members of NWTF-PD. She wants to prove and teach other members that being a hardworking person helps improve one's standing in life. Even with the added responsibilities, Leonora continues to do well in her business activities and is a good center chief.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan she borrowed 25,000 pesos, or about $525, as additional capital for her rice trading business and pig fattening venture. The loan was paid in weekly installments and was repaid without delay. For this loan, Leonora's 16th, she is requesting 29,000 pesos, or about $625, to be used as additional capital for her businesses. Income resulting from the loan will be used for the education of her children and daily household expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":414141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"additional capital for her pig fattening & rice business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-02T04:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1160},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6960,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7111.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849004,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5926.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739672,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4640,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4741,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129092,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4640,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4741,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965888,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4640,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4741,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997802,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2320,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2370.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136722486,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T11:00:14Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:45:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149283,"name":"Nguy\u1ec5n's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>\"C.

T. is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by SEDA, a Kiva field partner.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Ph\u1ed1 Ch\u1edd 1 nh\u00f3m 02 (2).\r\n\r\nT. is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business selling soft drinks in the local community.  She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $147 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND which will be used, as before, to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her fourth loan from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 33 years old and the father of two children age 9 and 2, one of whom goes to school. He only completed two years of school and didn't continue since his parents had no vision for education. He lives with his family in his own home and supports his mother-in-law by sending foodstuffs monthly. His wife works in an egg production company (GALOVOS), and has been helping with the household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nHe left Gaza for Maputo in 1996 seeking better living conditions and started doing small ambulatory sales in the neighborhoods of Boane, Mafuiane and others. In 2003 he started work in a banana production and sales company (Bananalandia) where he works to this day, and where he earns a salary of 1630 Meticais per month, saving some through an informal savings and credit arrangement (Xitique) with colleagues.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe  never requested a loan from other credit institutions, and learned about Hluvuku from work colleagues. This is his first loan in the amount of 10,000 Meticais, with which he plans to purchase construction materials (galvanized roofing sheets, windows, doors and cement) to continue with his work. \r\n<p>\r\nThe primary objective of this loan is to improve housing conditions for his family, and he promises to pay back the loan without problems in order to receive more loans in the future to complete his house. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

She is a 59 year old widow and mother of five children 45, 40, 35, 30 and 24 years of age. The youngest child still goes to school. Gilda studied up to the fourth grade, but didn't continue due to her parent's lack of financial resources. She lives in her own house in the neighborhood of Luis Cabral in Maputo. In addition to her children she takes care of two grandchildren who live with her. \r\n<p>\r\nShe left Xai Xai  with her parents for Maputo while she was still very young. Later she married and moved to the neighborhood where she currently lives. After the death of her husband who worked for the Mozambique Railways, she received a survivor's pension in the amount of 2714 Meticais. She saves some through the traditional \"Xitique\" savings system. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has already raised seven loans with a credit cooperative (CCOM) to enlarge her house. Following many discussions about credit with her friends, she met Mr. Isaura, an employee of Hluvuku, and decided to request loans from this organization. This is her first loan, in the amount of 25,000 Meticais, with which she intends to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, iron and others) to continue her work. \r\n<p>\r\nShe promises to pay off the current loan in due course in order to take on additional loans in the future with the goal of completing work on her house and starting commercial activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Her husband works abroad as an electrician. He suffers from being away from his family just to give them a better life. Normita found a way to help her husband provide for their family \u2013 this is her farming business. She is the one who personally manages it, sometimes hiring a laborer.\r\n<p>\r\nSince Normita became a member of Kiva's field partner, Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), she has used every loan as additional capital for her farming business. She will again be using this loan to buy necessary things for her business. She will buy rice seed, fertilizer and many other items, and she will use the loan to pay for all the activities in planting the rice. She is sure her business will be more productive with the help of this loan.\r\n<p>\r\nNormita's dream is to make her farm grow. Aside from the extra income it provides for their daily expenses and the education of their children, it is important to them because they inherited it from her parents.

N. is from the village of Dimalco in Bonifacio Misamis Occidental.

To make a living, Rosita owns & operates a specialized retail store where she sells daily-use products, soft drinks, and dry goods in the local community. Rosita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. Rosita is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Rosita's fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for her children's tuition. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. is a typical mother who wishes nothing more in life but for her children to finish college and to get the family out of poverty. Together with her loving and supportive partner in life, she works hard to earn money for the everyday expenses of her family. However, her business is still too small to earn enough for their daily financial needs. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Luz is requesting for a loan through ASHI for capital to expand her business. She is very eager for this vision because, without her business, she and her husband could have no other means to earn as much as possible. While her two children (now ages 7 and 10) are young, Luz wants to invest more money through loan so it reaches

for five years. His business is open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. and he works hard to service his clients in the community. This is reflected in the fact that his monthly profit before this loan was approximately 150,000 RWF per month (approximately US$270) and now his monthly profit has been highly increased.\r\n\r\nJean Bosco is requesting his 2nd loan to purchase new equipment and it is worth noting that he repaid his first loan on time and in full. His hope is that by building this business and making it bigger, he is securing a promising future for his young family.

P. Sr., or \u201cBoy\u201d as he is known in his village, is 58 years old. He only finished elementary education. Due to hardships, he was unable to pursue his studies. Instead, he helped his father cultivate their farm lot by planting rice and some vegetables. When he was 18, his uncle, who is a mechanic, hired him to be a conductor and collector in his jeepney. At the same time, he taught him how to drive and how to repair the jeepney; after a year, he could perform both tasks with ease.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, Domingo decided that he wanted to purchase his own jeepney so that he could apply what he had learned from his uncle. From that time onwards, he tried to save more of his income; after three years, he bought his own jeepney, which he used to earn income. \r\n\r\nDomingo is married to Teresita P.; they are gifted with five children. They want their children to finish their studies so that they will find stable jobs someday. Consequently, they are doing their best to earn money with which they can support the studies of their children. His wife is engaged in selling snacks in the school campus. \r\n\r\nAs a result of their patience and sacrifices, they are able to earn an income of P 8,000 per month, which they use to meet their daily needs and finance the schooling of their children.

P. is 6 years older than her husband, Marticiano P., at the age of 55 years old. Most of their children now have their own families, so their family started to get big. Rosenda wants to help all her children in raising their children, especially financially; that is why Rosenda and her husband are striving hard to provide for their big family. The main source of their income is through their fishing business that is personally managed by her husband because he is a fisherman, but aside from that they also run a fish and gasoline business. All of this business contributes to their daily income, but the fishing business is the one that contributes the most, so they focus on it.<p>\r\n\r\nSince she became a member of Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), every loan that Rosenda receives is used in improving this business; that is why her business will continue to run and grow. Her fourth loan will be used again in buying necessary things needed by her business like fishnets, accessories for the fishnets, and much more. And some part of the loan will be used in buying what is needed for their secondary business, which is the buy and sell. She is hoping that after buying all of these things their business will improve more.<p>\r\n\r\nRosenda's dream is that someday they will own a boat and fish cage. Now they will work hard to make this dream possible. And after this dream becomes a reality of course the result will be that their income will increase and they will help their children in providing for their children; and they will be able to release their family from the shadow of

She hopes that the savings from additional profits that are not reinvested will allow her to take care of her children, including her two dependents, through paying school fees and providing more food for them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":419406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy men's shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kicukiro\/Kigali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-11-03T20:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dancilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782195,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":127125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169292,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":127125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037513,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022617,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781705,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709586,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-04T00:09:52Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149461,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia is 48 years old, married and has six children.

His work fills him with great optimism and allows him to help his beloved children. His goal is to improve the quality of his agricultural products even more and expand his business.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

C., 31 years old, is a young widow living with her two children, both grade school students, in Maricaban, Pasay City.  Natalie owns a general store which she opened two years ago.  Life was been hard since her husband passed away, as she now stands as both mother and father to her two children.  Thanks to her faith and perseverance, her general store is growing steadily despite stiff competition from other stores in the community.  Because of high demand, she has also ventured into prepaid electronic load credits for mobile phones.  Business is brisk and she usually makes at least P8,000.00 a month.  <p>\r\n\r\nNatalie devotes much of her time attending to her business to help her in her grief over the passing of her husband, and she also finds time to attend gatherings for women entrepreneurs organized by the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative, of which she became a member in 2007.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is now applying for a loan in the amount of P10,000.00  to buy more grocery items for her store.  Natalie dreams of having a larger grocery store and a house and lot for her and her children.  She also hopes to retail rice.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n

is Daler, who is an animated guy filled with enthusiasm. He works hard preparing and selling the national pie called \u201csambusa\u201d (it is the flour course with the meat that is baked in the coals according to the old recipes) in a small place which he rents. Since he was very young, Daler learned a great deal about sambusa preparation from his mother and that's why he decided to dedicate himself to this work.\r\n\r\nDaler has big plans and dreams to grow his business. His goal is to have his own place where he can offer more comforts to his customers. And he'd like to buy a refrigerator so he can begin to offer cold drinks as well.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose in mind, Daler wants to take a loan of 1,500 USD to purchase the necessary ingredients for preparing sambusa and also to improve his business conditions. He is very motivated to grow his business and increase his income. With his efforts and your important contribution, Daler can reach his goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is Lourdes G., a 59-year-old widow from Pasay City. She now lives with her nine children, one of whom studies in college.\r\n\r\nLourdes is a fruit dealer. She supplies different fruit varieties to at least ten fruit vendors scattered across the city. She also retails her fruit in bus stations and busy streets in large plastic baskets. She has been in business for twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nLourdes also runs a small eatery. She enjoys what she does, especially that her usual monthly earnings of P27,000 help her a lot in pursuing her child\u2019s college education. She is also able to provide the basic daily needs of her big family. She only laments that she sometimes gets into trouble when some of her vendors are unable to remit their payments on time.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Lourdes joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative. She is now on her 15th loan and expects to receive a new loan in the amount of P34,000 as additional capital to buy more fruit.\r\n\r\nLourdes dreams of a new house and lot for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

and money shortages never defeated Barno, who has always looked for a way to get past obstacles and continue to improve her situation. She is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 32 years old, married, and the loving mother of three children.\r\n\r\nFor more than 6 years, Barno has operated a store where she sells women\u2019s clothing. As a rule she travels to the neighboring town to get new garments at very cheap prices. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nBarno hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. She promises to repay the loan with accuracy as she has done with previous loans.\r\n\r\nBe an important part of the growth of Barno\u2019s business.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his parents in the La Colorada area, which is in the Morrope district, located 45 minutes to the north of the city of Chiclayo.  For two years, he has made a living taking photographs.  He tells us that he discovered his interest in photography by taking photos at parties and get-togethers organized by his family.  Little by little he learned more about the techniques needed to carry out this activity as a trade, and ever since he been in this line of work.\r\n\r\nUsually his customers call him when they want him to take photographs of a party or meeting; later he travels to the city of Chiclayo to develop the images and then he delivers them to the owners within a period not exceeding 24 hours.  This business was his only stable source of income until a few months ago, when one of his brothers became gravely ill and he had to leave this activity to engage in other activities that would allow him to support his family in meeting the costs of recuperation.  He had to sell his camera to raise money to pay for the therapy that his brother needed in order to recover.\r\n\r\nNow that his brother is better, Abel would like to resume his photography business.  For this reason he has requested a loan for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa, in the amount of 1000 nuevos soles.  This loan will be used to buy a new camera, photo albums and photo frames with which he can relaunch his business.\r\n\r\nHe main wish is to have a photographic laboratory in Morrope where he can develop his own photographs.  He is a young entrepreneur who responds to difficult situations with responsibility.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

al distrito de M\u00f3rrope, ubicado una hora al norte de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nEl se dedica a la agricultura y a la venta de animales menores. Empez\u00f3 trabajando como agricultor pero los continuos problemas de escasez de agua para la irrigaci\u00f3n de los sembr\u00edos en la zona hizo que poco a poco dejara de sembrar y que le dedicara m\u00e1s tiempo a la crianza y venta de animales.\n\nJorge compra animales para luego criarlos y venderlos a los negociantes que frecuentan la zona. Usualmente cr\u00eda cerdos, pavos, patos y cuyes. Las continua necesidad por la que atraviesa su familia y el incremento de la demanda por parte de sus compradores han hecho que planee ampliar su negocio por lo que se encuentra solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles para invertirlos en la compa de m\u00e1s animales.\n\nEl nos cuenta que su mayor anhelo es poder construir su casa de material noble (de ladrillos y cemento) y brindarle a sus hijos la oportunidad de estudiar alguna carrera superior.

They live in the Cruz del M\u00e9dano sector, belonging to the district of M\u00f3rrope, located an hour north of the city of Chiclayo. \r\n<p>\r\nHe works in agriculture and the sale of small animals. He began working as a farmer but the continuous problems of water scarcity for crop irrigation in the area caused him to little by little leave farming and dedicate more time to raising and selling animals. \r\n<p>\r\nJorge buys animals to raise them and sell them to businessmen that frequent the area. He usually raises pigs, turkeys, duck, and guinea pigs. The continuous necessity of his family is the increased demand that his customers have. For this reason he plans to grow his business and this is why he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles to invest in purchasing more animals. \r\n<p>\r\nHe tells us that his greatest longing is to be able to build his house of noble materials (brick and cement) and provide his children with the opportunity to for advanced studies. He is a responsible father who always gives his best in his work in order to take care of himself and his own. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva

C. is from the village of Makawa Aloran Misamis Occidental. She is 56 years old. Jovita is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Jovita owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Jovita has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jovita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from GDMPC. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Jovita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

R. is from the village of Happy Valley, Tambulig Zamboang Del Sur. She is 33 years old. Gelisah Fay is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Gelisah Fay owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling \"chicharon\" fried skin from pig and cow products and other dried goods in the local community. Gelisah Fay has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gelisah Fay joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gelisah Fay has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from GDMPC. Gelisah Fay is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business and used as an additional capital of the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Gelisah Fay from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children and save as a reserve for future needs of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Marlon is a high-school graduate and has his own family, while Editha is presently taking her first year of college education. \r\n<p>\r\nCorazon dreams of seeing her child finish her education and have her own job for her future. She doesn\u2019t have any wealth for her child to inherit, and she knows that education is the only wealth that she can give. Her business serves her in providing for her child's tuition fees during times of examination. She planned to sell her pigs because she does not have enough resources to cover her pigs' feed. When she heard about the program, she was interested, and finally she joined the program. She wanted to borrow the amount of 5,000 PHP for the purchase of pig feed, so they will become healthy and have a heavy weight when they are sold to buyers.

T. is from the village of Buyog Banlag, Valencia City. She is 45 years old. Marissa is married and has 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Marissa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Marissa has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marissa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marissa is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Marissa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Now all of them are  degree holders. \r\n<p>\r\nShe and her husband Crispin M., 52 years old, are also proud of themselves because all of their hard work had good results. She knows that their children will have better lives but still not that easy, so they still need to work hard to continue to survive. \r\n<p>\r\nTheir source of income comes from their variety store and their farming business. These businesses help them to make their dream possible, which is to finish the studies of their children.\r\n<p>\r\nSince Virginia became a member of ASHI she always used her loans to make their businesses grow and it really helps. \r\n<p>\r\nVirginia plans to use her 9th loan as additional capital for their farming business. This is because now their variety store has closed and they want first to focus on the farming business. She will help her husband to improve this business. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan she will buy rice seeds, fertilizers, vitamins for the rice and other products to cultivate the land, plus she will pay expenses for labor. She is hoping that this will make their business more productive.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause Virginia achieved her biggest dream -- to finish her childrens\u2019 studies -- she just wishes now that God never tires of giving them blessings every day. Of course they will continue to strive hard so that their family will always experience a better life and also to extend their blessings to others.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":419945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For

I. is 39 years old and happily married to Ernesto I. 49 years old. They have two children, Ara Lyn, 15, in fourth year high school and Jan Ernest, 5, in his pre-school year. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto works as a farmer and also takes care of the land in their place because the owner does not stay there so Ernesto is responsible for planting the land. This is one of their sources of income; also, Avellana manages a direct selling business of different ready-to-wear clothes, personal and beauty products. This is her one way of helping her husband provide for their family, because even though he works hard still the income is not enough. Also Avellana want to save for the future of their children.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nEvery loan that she has received from ASHI has been a big help in improving their business. She hopes to use her 7th loan for her business. She will buy items her business needs, like different pants, blouses, t-shirts, footwear, underwear, lotion, lipstick, cologne and so on. All of this is for sale and she is sure that after buying these she will get an income that will sustain the needs of their family.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAvellana\u2019s dream is to make her business run and grow to the point that they can build their own store where customers can easily find her. When that happens she is sure that she can afford to send all of her children to school until college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":419952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Luz makes and sells nipa (palm tree leaf) shingles (one of the most common roofing materials used by people in the Province of Antique).  She also has a manicure and pedicure business. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer and they both aim to send all of their children to college to experience a different kind of life \u2013 a life not being poor. Ma. Luz uses the proceeds from her businesses to augment her husband\u2019s income and to support the needs of their children until they have reached their dreams. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan she requests now, she hopes to grow her business and her profits. Without the loan, her dreams would be nothing and her children would still have the same kind of life in the future since Ma.

To provide for the needs of their children, now 10 and 5 years old, Junarlim decided to work overseas because people think that there are a lot of work opportunities there.

She is hoping that after buying all of these, her business will be more productive.<P>\r\n\r\nThe dream of Lorena for their children is to have them finish their studies until college, so that the sacrifice of their father in working abroad will not be wasted and so that they will have a better life in the future.

the age of 65, Eliza P. is still fighting against poverty, the difference in her case is that she has now no partner in providing for her family; her husband left her and she is already a widow. A good thing is that her older daughter is now working as a nurse and the younger one is in her last year in college. Both of her children now have their own families so instead of them helping her, Eliza wants to help them in providing for her grandchildren. <P>\r\n\r\nSo Eliza has never stopped working hard. As the source of their income, she runs a variety store business that serves as their main source of income and aside from that she is also a dealer in cloth, since most of her customers have sewing businesses. These businesses help them in their daily income and that is why now she always does the best thing to make these businesses continue to grow.<P>\r\n\r\nNow, accessing her 13th loan through Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) and a member since 1995, Eliza plans to use this loan in buying different things needed by her variety store business for its improvement. She will buy items like various groceries, soft drinks and many more. Also some part of the loan will be used for her other business. She is hoping that this whole thing will help her businesses to improve more.<P>\r\n\r\nEliza is not dreaming for herself now, only for her grandchildren. She wants to help them in any aspect, in either financial or moral support. She always prays that her business will continue to grow so that she can help her children's families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":419965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

J. is 46 years old. In 2004, a loan from ASHI provided her with enough capital to start up a business. Now, she is managing and financing three types of small businesses aside from her husband\u2019s fishing business. Loans she acquired from ASHI have enabled her to have hog fattening (pig raising), rice farming, and rice selling businesses. Additionally, Merlinda also accepts laundry from the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nOverall profit, however, is still small. This is because everything her family, including her three children (who range from 12 to 20 years old), needs is taken from the income of her businesses and that of her husband\u2019s. Nevertheless, Merlinda saves up some money to cover the expenses of her children's education.\r\n\r\nConsequently, she has able to support her eldest child\u2019s education in college until graduation. But now she has to support her two other children. In order to increase her savings, she is requesting this loan, which will be used to enhance her businesses until they grow and become more profitable. Merlinda enjoys working hard because of her children\u2019s determination in their studies despite being poor, and her husband\u2019s

While Eden takes care of her two children at home, she can use her time productively by raising pigs in their backyard.  Once the pigs have grown, they will be sold live or slaughtered for pork retailing. Profits from this business will be saved for the future education of her children and to augment her husband\u2019s income from being a laborer.\r\n\r\nAlthough Eden is just starting with her business, she hopes to grow it to a piggery some day.  With her membership in ASHI and access to larger loans over time, as well as the support of her husband, she knows she will be able to achieve success in her

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

O. is 36 years old. She is married and the loving mother of three children. \r\nGulnora breeds cattle. She buys the calves on the market at a low price, feeds them and then resells them on the same market at a more profitable price. Her husband also attends to this business. Gulnora works hard in order to make the business successful and to generate a stable income for the family. Today Gulnora is planning to purchase the cattle for her household to raise and sell. For this purpose she requests $800 US Dollars.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

group Sabali is composed of five women, all married, of whom three are from monogamous households.\u00a0 The women average 28 years of age and 3 children each and live in the Djaka district (Kirango) of Markala (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 They know one another through ties of kinship, marriage, friendship, and community.\u00a0 They are all members of the traditional association \"Traor\u00e9 Ton\", which lends its name to their current association.\u00a0 The group members do commerce exclusively in fish, in all its forms.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the needs of their customers, the women decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program and are now on their fifth solidarity loan after having repaid the four previous loans.\u00a0 This new loan will be used to buy 30 baskets of fresh fish and 50 bars of ice (furnished by transporters coming from Bamako).\u00a0\r\n\r\nSupplies of fresh fish are gotten on the banks of the Niger Rivers.\u00a0 The fish is sorted, and a portion is dried (either on gravel or on straw or on <i>seccos<\/i>).\u00a0 The fish is sold in all forms:\u00a0 the fresh fish is sold locally on the banks of the Niger River, in Kirango, and in Diamarabougou Markala, sometimes door-to-door in the districts.\u00a0 The fresh fish kept on ice is sold in S\u00e9gou (at the Ch\u00e2teau Market) and in Bamako.\u00a0 The dried fish (part of which is reserved until the waters recede and until the off-season when the women earn more money) is sold especially in Dougabougou, Siribala, Niono, Shango, Boussin, and at the weekly fair of S\u00e9gou.\u00a0 The smoked fish is essentially sold in S\u00e9gou. \u00a0 Sales are made generally in cash to customers composed of women and men.\r\n\r\nThe group members plan on realizing an average monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA that will be used to cover sundry family needs and to assist with societal events (baptisms, marriages, funerals).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nTheir ambition is to buy livestock, of which the males will be sold over time in order to build a concession in which to live.\u00a0 This is a way to ensure the children's future.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

Today he employs two people to help him run his business. His store is open from 6 AM to 9 PM every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Alexis has been in the business for 6 years, his capital reserves are still too low to expand his shop. He believes that a small amount of additional capital would allow him to expand his business by purchasing some new goods to sell. His sense of the market is that his current customers will respond well to these new offerings and he may also attract new clients.  He believes his strategy will be a profitable one and is looking for funding and loan investors. Alexis is, therefore, requesting his first loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":420047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"A variety inventory\/goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"NYARUGURU","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-11-06T06:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782200,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":127125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169297,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":127125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037518,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022622,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781709,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709590,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T17:00:34Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149754,"name":"Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hassan has been the owner of a car painting shop since 1994, by which he earns income to help satisfy the needs of his family.

They were a humble family with scant resources.  She is 46, and she has three children who are studying so that they can have a better future.  She is married, and her husband works in maintenance.  They live in a very poor neighborhood, which is threatened with violence everyday because of unemployment in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nSince she was ten years old, she has worked as a domestic employee, where she earns a low salary.  This does not allow her to work towards her objective of finishing her house.  In her free time she washes and irons to get other income to be able to cover the food necessities.  The basic necessities are super expensive, and they do not match her salary.\r\n\r\nShe has had eight cycles with Afodenic.  Thanks to the loans she has been able to make improvements.  With the previous loan she bought stones, sand, and iron.  But, she was not able to do anything.  With this loan she will start to change the roof, which is very old and leaks, and make the improvement.  She is grateful to the institution for giving poor women the opportunity to improve their homes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":420186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy zince to change the very old roof on her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-04T19:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petrona Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.4,"local_amount":1368.04,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1414.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601732,"comment":null},{"amount":33.96,"local_amount":679.14,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":702.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003177,"comment":null},{"amount":33.41,"local_amount":668.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":690.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874248,"comment":null},{"amount":33.79,"local_amount":675.73,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":698.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604146,"comment":null},{"amount":33.84,"local_amount":676.85,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":699.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639611,"comment":null},{"amount":33.88,"local_amount":677.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":700.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821385,"comment":null},{"amount":62.72,"local_amount":1254.39,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1297.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561402,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-05T04:41:22Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149781,"name":"Amy","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Amy N. est une soci\u00e9taire de Baye Laye Guediawaye  qui \u00e9volue dans le commerce de chaussures d\u2019hommes et de femmes .Elle exerce aussi la vente de diner le soir (lakh,dakhine),de petit  d\u00e9jeuner le matin.
