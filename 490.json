is a young mother and wife \u2013 she has three daughters and three sons. Hana's husband works with the Palestinian NationA. Authority. The family owns a small bookstore in the city selling books, stationary, gift items and accessories. Hana wants to improve the business by selling more variety; therefore, Hana came to FATEN for a loan to purchase stationary and books.\n\nHana's son, Ziyad, appears in the picture as Hana comes from a conservative background.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

I love to vote!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Anh needed financing to make improvements to her salon, she turned to Opportunity Fund - her local microfinance institution (MFI) - for a small business loan.  Anh learned about Opportunity Fund years ago when her eldest daughter opened a savings account through the non-profit MFI. With a $3,500 loan she will be able to make electrical renovations and bring her salon into compliance with fire codes.  Anh is also excited to have the chance to use a microloan to build her credit.  \u201cI don\u2019t need a lot of money at once, so this is very good. Then, once Opportunity Fund knows me and that I can repay, I\u2019ll be able to get another loan to help with a bigger remodeling job.\u201d

P. is a married woman who lives in Purok Bayog, Barangay Patiui, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by vegetable farming.  Her husband, Dario P., who is 49 years old, works works with her on the farm and also helps her sell their vegetable harvest.  They have two children who are 16 and  23 years old. \r\n\r\nElma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $338, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing 28,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers for her vegetable farm so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. Elma P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Jonalyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

R. is a 51-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing business.  She lives in Purok 5, Barangay Bonawon, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $290. \r\n\r\nJulieta is borrowing 30,000 PHP so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, farming and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Rodrigo C., who is 52 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 11 to  29 years old. \r\n\r\nMarrieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marrieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $214, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy feed for the pigs and inventory for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Marrieta C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

F. is a 48-year-old married man who supports his family by operating a fishing  business.  He and his family live in Purok 2, Barangay Inalad, Siaton, Negros Oriental. He has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since August of 2007 and has improved his living conditions with the help of his loans from NWTF and through his own efforts. By working hard in his fishing business, he is gradually making his family more economically stable. He now earns an average monthly income of about $157. \r\n\r\nOscar is borrowing 30,000 PHP so that he can purchase fishing gear and equipment for his fishing operations.  His previous loan of 30,000 PHP, which he paid off well within its term, was just another step in his journey toward economic freedom. Oscar aspires to elevate his family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

G. is a married woman who lives in Purok Daisy, Barangay Talacagay, Hinobaan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Food Vending and General Store businesses. Her husband, Wilfredo G., who is 50 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 17 to 23 years old. \r\n\r\nAlestina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alestina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $150, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing 14,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy ingredients for her food vending and inventory for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Alestina G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Barangay Mantalongon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and tailoring businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $300. \r\n\r\nTeofila is borrowing 12,000 PHP so that she can purchase materials for her tailoring business.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Teofila aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and insure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: fishing, a general store and a manicure business. Her husband, Reynaldo C., who is 42 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 9 to 12 years old, all currently going to school. \r\n\r\nAnalinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Analinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $210, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for future educational purposes. Analinda C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

city of Cochabamba.  He is married to Sra. Hilda and they have six children, of whom two are already independent.  Elias works as a mason in the area where he lives, but he also receives contracts from other provinces within the department as well as from the city.\r\n<p>\r\nElias lived in the city of Santa Cruz five years ago before returning to Cochabamba because of a problem with his sister-in-law.  Through the fault of this person, Elias lost his house and all of his belongings were auctioned off by the bank.  He and his family picked themselves up and moved in a new direction so that they could start over.  Elias and his wife now have a cottage and land for growing corn, which is harvested every six months and provides an additional source of income.  While Elias is working as a mason on different construction jobs, his wife works at a plant nursery caring for flowers that are grown in the area for specific times of the year.  They also grow potatoes and corn to help support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan Elias is requesting will be used to purchase water so that he can irrigate his crops of potatoes and corn throughout the year.  This will help him earn more income so that his children can finish their high school studies.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Elias dreams of seeing his children finish high school since he was not able to earn a degree.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, buying and selling rice and a catering\/food vending business. Her husband, Ricardo B. Sr., who is 62 years old, also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 31 to 43 years old. \r\n\r\nRafaela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rafaela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $200, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is again borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and the payment of debts. Rafaela B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

M. is a widow who lives in Hda. Yusay, Barangay San Jose, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures. She gives manicures and does smocking detail on fabrics. \r\n\r\nAngeles joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $120, thus raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy materials for her smocking business so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business and for the education of her children.  Angeles M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband, Rolly, who is 37 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are aged between 6 and 13 years old.\r\n\r\nCriselda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Criselda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000 thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and feed for the piggery, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the expansion of her piggery. Criselda T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference to the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Eddie P., who is 50 years old, works as a Brgy. Captain to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 25 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nRaquel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Raquel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, with which she intends to buy piglets and groceries for the store so that she could continue to save up for future expansion of her businesses and education for her children. \r\n\r\nRaquel P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Through their hardship, industry and the support of ASHI, two of their children have  finished college.\r\n\r\nHer loans in ASHI really help them a lot because the income that they get from her business is used for their daily expenditures.\r\n\r\nAzucena has been a member of ASHI for eight years already and, because of her good attitude, she had been elected as center chief of San Pedro Center 10 of ASHI ASB at present. As a member, she maintains her good performance, which is why she got a bigger loan. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to have a loan from ASHI, through the partnership of KIVA, for PHP 24,000 to use as additional capital for their hog fattening and tricycle businesses.\r\n\r\nIf this request is granted, it will be a great help for them to sustain the needs of the family and to help their relatives and

Her husband works in a factory. His income is not enough to bear the financial expenses of the whole family. That\u2019s why Kosar started her embroidery business. She has given birth to two sons. Her elder son also works in the factory on a monthly wage, while her younger son is nine years old and is studying in the 3rd class. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her embroidery business. With the loan, she will buy embroidery materials such as colored thread, clothes, beads and sketches in bulk that will help her fulfill orders on time and generate a good income as well. Kosar remains worried about the financial future of her family, but she is hopeful that after this loan investment, her family\u2019s financial condition will get better. She is a new loan applicant of Asasah. She hopes that it will be a profitable experience for her.\r\n\r\nNote: \"In the photo, the lady who has holds a book (called Asasah Passbook) and shows her embroidered dress is Kosar\".

T. is from the town of Lopez Jaena. She is 35 years old. Aida is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Aida owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Aida has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Aida joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Aida is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Aida from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is from the village of Unidos. She is 59 years old. Mariquita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Mariquita owns and operates a business venture in the agricultural sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chickens for sale. Mariquita has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Mariquita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mariquita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Mariquita is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Mariquita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

B. is from the village of Unidos. She is 46 years old. Liza is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Liza owns and operates a retail clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general clothing services to local community members. Liza has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Liza joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fabric and materials. Liza is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Liza from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":633073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

V., a married woman who lives in Purok Bool, Brgy. Cartagena, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental, earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a fishing enterprise. Her husband, Danilo V., 36, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children ranging in age from nine months to eight years. <p>\r\n\r\nDolores joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is requesting PHP 29,500, with which she intends to buy a new pump boat and stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Dolores V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a community member who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourteenth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and meet her family needs. \r\n\r\nGina E. is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through this alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities they could not even have dreamed of.

Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital\/maintenance so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Lolita L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.

She now earns an average monthly income of 9,000 PHP. \r\n\r\nLucita is now borrowing 18,000 PHP so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her last loan of 14,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lucita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Aida is a widow with four children. Being a widow has not in any way dampened her determination as she has continuously worked hard to provide for her family without the support of her husband.

Despite the challenges encountered, she never gives up. She is trying her best to earn a living and to pay her loan to ASHI because she doesn't want her good performance to be ruined.\r\n\r\nSince the income\/work of her husband is unstable, they plan to buy a tricycle and they need PHP 40,000.00 to start the project. This project is very helpful to them because if her husband does not have work, he can drive their tricycle so they have a stable income.\r\n\r\nShe wishes to have all of their children finish their studies through college so that they will never experience the hardship brought on by poverty. She also dreams that through their industry and courage they will reach their dreams.\r\n\r\nLastly, she is very thankful to our almighty for giving her strength to face the challenges of life and she

With the help of her past eleven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her twelfth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her peanut-butter business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

their family. They have been blessed with two children: Kieth, 7 years old, and Staisy, 4 years old. Evans runs a hotel business at Kampi ya Moto trading centre in the town of Koibatek; he started this business three years ago.

S. is a 48-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: a ready-to-wear clothes business and a welding shop business. \r\n\r\nShe lives in Brgy. Bulwang, Mabinay, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her ready-to-wear clothes and welding shop businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 15000.  \r\n\r\nNelly is now borrowing PHP 19500 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nNelly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). \r\n\r\nThrough the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

Pandan, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:   Buying and Selling of Rice, Pig Fattening, and a General Store business.  \r\n\r\nHer husband Florencio, who is 63 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living.  They have three children who are 21 to 26 years old. \r\n\r\nMagdalina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Magdalina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks of rice to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nMagdalina N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). \r\n\r\nThrough the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

D. C. is a 51-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: hog raising and general store businesses.  She lives in Prk. Bloomington, Brgy. Candau-ay, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her hog raising and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now eans an average income of PHP 8,000. Lily is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can continue to purchase feeds for her piggery and stocks for the general store.   This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lily aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fish vending so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. Mary Jean B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":632994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

B. is a married woman who lives in Proper Budlasan, Canlaon City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   a general store, motorcycle transport and videoke singing. Her husband Pasto B. Jr., who is 40 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have five children who are 13 to 21 years old. Meliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Meliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks of goods for her general store so that she can continue to save for the future expansion of her business and the education of her children. Meliza B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org. \t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":633009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more stock to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"San Carlos, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-11-09T03:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":846.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":846.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.76,"local_amount":4230.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4545.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182593149,"comment":null},{"amount":63.46,"local_amount":2538.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2727.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188729653,"comment":null},{"amount":84.61,"local_amount":3384.4,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3636.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191467614,"comment":null},{"amount":21.17,"local_amount":846.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":909.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196030300,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-09T19:46:37Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:52:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":246018,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Margret O. is currently in the business of selling groundnut phaste at the market and is requesting a loan to stock more groundnuts to make phaste to sell.

T. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Titong, Brgy. Budlasan, Canlaon City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a general store.  Her husband, Jose Ceriales, who is 65 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have five children who are 14 to 27 years old. Rosalina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,500 which she intends to use to buy grocery items for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business.  Rosalina T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on

Malipayon, Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a buy & sell livestock business. She has three children who are 16 to 20 years old. Procy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Procy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future family expenses & the education of her children.  Procy C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Thelma is now borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase raw materials. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Thelma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

In addition she owns rental house which contributes to her other source of income. Fatuma faces a major challenge of seasonality in her business. During rainy season, the supply of coconuts at the market is low compared to the hot summer season, where supply is high hence satisfying customer needs. She hopes to construct additional rental houses in the future. \n\nShe decided to join Yehu because of its good reputation in the community.

Y. is a married woman who lives in Prk Taraple, Bgry. Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a networking  business.  Her husband Jose Y., who is 64 years old, is a retired employee who helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 15 to 27 years old. Estela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Estela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock so that she can continue to save up for the future. Estela Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her small eatery and piggery businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.

Utod, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store.  Her husband, Joygen A., who is 29 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living.  They have two children who are 3 to 6 years old. Cristine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cristine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business and the education of her children. Cristine A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

As is common among Lebanese women, she helps her husband with the family expenses.

M. is a married woman who lives in Prk Santan, Brgy. Calumangan, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and a clothing business. \r\n\r\nHer husband Aron M., who is 60 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 31 to 40 years old. \r\n\r\nEvelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business. \r\n\r\nEvelyn M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). \r\n\r\nThrough the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She lives in Brgy. Daan Banua, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food vending and livestock raising businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. Jasmin is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can purchase raw materials. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Jasmin aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on
