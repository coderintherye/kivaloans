Shahodat started this business when she couldn't find any other way to support herself and her family, so this venture is just like her baby, and she is very excited to see it expand and become sustainable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Noroy is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 49 years old, divorced, and the loving mother of 5 children. Noroy started her own business after her divorce from her husband. \r\n\r\nFor more than 10 years, she has operated a store where she sells children\u2019s clothing and toys. Her store is well known and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. Noroy hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her children. \r\n\r\nTo make that possible, she has applied for a new loan of 5000 Somoni to buy more clothing to sell. She promises to repay the loan in time and thanks everyone for supporting her.     \r\n \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 46 years old, married, and has four children, ages 28, 20, 9 and 6.  All the children go to school.  Carlos finished tenth grade but did not continue because of financial difficulties and because he had to start working while very young.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports two brothers and two younger relatives (nieces or nephews) who live with him.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, he left Inhambane to come to Maputo while completing his military service.  In 1986 he got married and established a home, where he is still living today.  Carlos works in general medicine in the military hospital and has a salary of 10,800 meticais per month.  He uses the money for household expenses and saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks.  Carlos learned about Hluvuku through its loan officers, who came to his workplace to run an enrollment drive.  This is his third loan, and he is asking for 30,000 meticais.  He intends to buy construction materials (sand, cement, blocks, zinc sheets, beams and other items) to continue construction on his house.\r\n\r\nCarlos promises to pay off this loan on time so he can take out other loans.  In the future he would like to ask for more loans to finish building and furnishing his house.  He also intends to ask for a loan to buy a vehicle.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

M. was born in Catembe Municipal District, Maputo Province in southern Mozambique.  She is 42 years old, married, and has five children, ages 25, 23, 20, 9 and 4.  Three of the children go to school.  Felismina only finished third grade and did not continue because of her parents' financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and also supports a niece who lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Catembe to move to Maputo City when she got married.  Felismina has run her own business from her yard for more than 10 years.  She has no employees and earns about 6,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nFelismina has never had loans from  other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is her second loan, and she is asking for 23,000 meticais.  She intends to buy construction materials (cement, sand, blocks, stone and other items) to continue building her house.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can have more loans.  One of Felismina's dreams is to have an official wedding ceremony.  In the future she intends to ask for more loans to develop her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

is married to two wives and has seven children, four of whom are under the age of fifteen. He lives in Kobenyang, Momo Division, in the northwest region of Cameroon. As a very hard-working guy. He has faced some major challenges in life, such as inadequate funds to pay for his children's education, ill health, and death of relatives. In 2008, he saw GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member. He has received and repaid loans from GHAPE twice and his previous repayments were encouraging.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he is requesting now, he plans to invest in his farm. With the profit from the loan, he will pay for his children's education, clothe them, and give them good food and good medication whenever they are sick.\r\n\t\r\nHe prefers to receive loan from GHAPE, rather than other financial institutions, because of the training GHAPE offers and because proper follow-up is done to ensure the loan is properly managed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum

With the profit from the loan, she plans to pay for her children's' education, clothe them, give them good food and good medication whenever they are sick.\r\n\t\r\nShe prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE to other financial institutions because of the training GHAPE offers and because proper follow up is done to ensure the loan is properly managed.\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

The group members work in the following trades: Hermina, Leoncia, Felicitas, Martina, Liova, Guadencia, and Angela are all potters and make casseroles, jars, pots, crockery, etc\r\nLiova has been a member of the group for three loan cycles, and is a widow and has two children - one boy who has finished his studies, and one girl who goes to secondary school. She wants to grow her business for the future so she can export her merchandise to other countries. This would let her and her children move forward in life and would enable the girl who is in school to go to university.\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy clay in bulk, loads of fire wood, and paint in order to make casseroles, pots, jars, china plates, flowerpots, etc and to sell them in Mexico City and around Puebla and Morelos and so to earn more income to support her children. \r\nLiova tells us that she feels very comfortable with the group and that she is a very reliable repayer and punctual, and she comments that she is very grateful to the Foundation and Kiva for offering her a loan and she hopes that she will show them good results from her work and that the group can continue working with them in the future. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":536780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy clay, wood, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Marcos, Puebla.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-05-15T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leoncia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liova","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaudencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":32000,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715826,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715827,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899556,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899557,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8031.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639902,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8031.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854184,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T05:36:05Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200598,"name":"Bredi Trust Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is twenty-two years old and single.

Pero sabe muy bien que debe ir a paso lento , pero seguro , y se esfuerza todos los d\u00edas en su trabajo, cuida con esmero sus plantaciones para que no sean da\u00f1adas por plagas . Trabaja junto a su esposa, durante 10 horas diarias, pero en temporada de sembr\u00edo y cosecha contrata a  peones para que le puedan facilitar la extracci\u00f3n de su producto final.Este es su segundo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y  se compromete a cumplir puntualmente con sus respectivos pagos, adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 eternamente agradecido con su grupo comunal, por la organizaci\u00f3n y solidaridad que muestran en el trabajo conjunto.Ra\u00fal tiene pensado  invertir el dinero solicitado en brindarle  mantenimiento adecuado a su terreno de cultivo , y para esto comprar\u00e1 abono y fertilizantes, con el prop\u00f3sito de mejorar la calidad de sus productos.","en":"Raul, 42 years old, lives with his partner and they have three small children.  They live together in a community located at the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they have their own home.  Raul is a very demanding person.  Considering that he lived with little money and convinced his wife to increase the size of their farm land, since they worked in small parcels and the money they were making from the sale of their products was not enough.  Currently they produce a larger quantity of cacao and their profits have increased considerably.  He still feel that there are many things to be accomplished in this life, and for this reason he is planning to buy more farmland in the future from other producers, with the goal of planting other products such as coffee and citrus fruit.  He knows very well that he needs to move at a slow and secure pace, and works hard every day, takes good care of his crops so that they are not damaged by pests.  He works together with his wife for 10 hours of every day.  At planting and harvest times, he hires laborers to help him get his final product.  This is a second loan with MFP and he commits to pay his installments on time.  Also, he is eternally grateful to his community group for the organization and fellowship that they show in their team work.  Raul is planning to use the loan money to provide adequate maintenance to his fields by buying manure and fertilizer with the purpose of improving the quality of his products.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":539838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":" Purchase of fertilizers and supplies for the care of his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-14T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886416,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-28T11:38:48Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200601,"name":"Tehatsi Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo se llama TEHATSI, porque en otom\u00ed significa \u201cbuenos d\u00edas\u201d.

They have 4 children together, but only one still lives with them, in the house they own.  Despite diverse family and financial problems, she found the strength to forge ahead.  For this reason, three years ago, she started selling a variety of refreshments along with egg and cheese sandwiches and hamburgers.  Meanwhile, her husband works as a moto-taxi driver.  With these activities, they manage to bring in 45.00 Peruvian soles each day, and with this income they support the education of their youngest child and pay for their household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe aspect she enjoys most about her work is selling her products.  She offers samples of her food as a marketing strategy.  For now, she wants to prioritize by purchasing edible products and sweets to supply her stand, since she conducts her business in an ambulatory manner.  This is her sixth credit with MFP.  She feels her progress began once she started working with the other members, who she respects and values a great deal.  She is an active participant in the group.  She will use the loan she is requesting to buy candy, cookies, sweets, and sodas.     \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

She will use money from the loan to buy tables and chairs for her food stand.  \r\n\r\nThe treasurer, Sra. ALICIA sells honey.  She buys her product from producers in various parts of Bolivia and sells it, generally, at markets in La Paz.  She has two daughters, 12 and 9, and her greatest hope is to see them land professional careers.  She is a courageous woman who strives hard to make sure nothing will hold her back.  \r\n\r\nThe secretary, Sra.

","en":"Reina, 48 years of age, is married and has seven children.  She lives in the jungle of Cusco, in a small community, where she has her own house.  Since she was young, she dedicated herself to cultivating cacao as her parents saw that she was responsible and put her in charge of a small farm.  However, the income she generated from selling this product wasn\u2019t enough to provide financial stability.  Over time, she saved her money and started a grocery store in her community.  Since then, she has generated a good income and she is confident she can get ahead with her two endeavors (growing cacao and the store) and manage to achieve a higher standard of living for her family.\r\n\r\nShe can always count on her husband, who helps and advises her.  Generally, he is in charge of the farms along with occasional help from laborers at harvest time.  In the meantime, Reina tends to the store.  For the most part, they sell their cacao at the community\u2019s supply centers.

(boiled corncobs and corn kernels), Eutimio G\u00f3mez T. (services, bricklaying).\r\n\r\nDon Tacho, as the other group members call him, is who we are going to talk about.  He is 63 years old, and is going to start a business selling magazines and newspapers.  He tells us that the neighborhood where he lives doesn\u2019t have a magazine stand.  Currently, he lives with his wife, Isabel Santamar\u00eda Nopaltlali, and they have 4 children: Arturo D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda, 39 years old (married), Macario D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda, 29 years old (married), Armando D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda, 27 yeards old (married), Carlos D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda, 22 years old, the youngest, and also married.\r\n\r\nIgnacio and his wife currently live alone, and he says he\u2019d like me to mention that he wants to slowly grow his new business to have a more stable source of income.  Currently, he works in the country and, since he is now older, it is more difficult every day for him to find work.  This is why he needs this business, and to be able to grow it.\r\n\r\nHe is happy to have been given the opportunity to receive this credit, and he gives thanks ahead of time for the confidence placed in him.  Thanks to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad he can try to get ahead.  His wife Isabel also thanks you with all her heart for your support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":538917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase magazines and newspapers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-05-14T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anatacio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eutimio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humberto Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antolina Cornelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5560.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715828,"comment":null},{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5560.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899558,"comment":null},{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5560.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639903,"comment":null},{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5560.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854185,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T19:34:50Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200612,"name":"Karel Eunice","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karel Eunice L.

Together they work with great determination so their only son, Miguel, will lack nothing. \r\n\r\nFor more than 20 years she has worked to provide a good quality of life to her only son. To that end she sells ice cream during the day and sweets in the evenings from a small sales location and while walking around. Her partner works as a motorcycle taxi driver, using a vehicle he bought through a lot of effort. With the income they both earn they are able to cover the household expenses and the education of their son. At the same time they are saving for the future so they can use the money in a project such as building their own house or to buy another moto-vehicle that would help them earn greater income. \r\n\r\nWhat Carmen likes the most is attending to her clients in a careful manner. However, it bothers her to have to work until the late hours of the night, which is tiring, even though it is worth the effort since the business is profitable and allows them to live  without economic worries. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is very happy working with her communal group where she receives educational talks that help her carefully use the loans she receives. \r\n\r\nWith this request for 3000 soles she will buy another moto-vehicle and rent it daily, which will assure them of  benefiting economically.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva

Together they reside in a community located in the Cuzco rain forest, where they own their house. Sonia works with her husband, who is her partner. For some time they have engaged in the production and marketing of cocoa and coca leaf. This activity produces good income that allows them to have a good quality of life. They haven't always enjoyed economic prosperity. There were times when they went hungry because they did not have enough money, but working together they were able to get ahead. \r\n\r\nCurrently they have potential customers, and they are doing well in the marketing of natural products, due to the constant sacrifice of both her and her husband. She is proud and happy for everything that has happened. It is for this reason that every morning she goes to her farm, to care for it, usually working with her husband. At harvest time she has to hire laborers to expedite the efficient picking of cocoa and coca leaf.  Normally, she sells the products to collection centers in her community. \r\n\r\nHer future plan is to install a clothing store, since there are few stores of this type in her community, and she calculates  that it should produce a good income. This is her second loan with MFP, and she promises to comply promptly with her payments. Sonia also likes to participate actively in her communal bank, because responsibility is shared by all members.  She plans to invest the money requested in providing maintenance for her farm, buying fertilizer and manure for their respective plantings of cacao and coca leaf.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":539872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"BUYING MANURE AND FERTILIZER FOR HER FARM LAND ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-14T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886420,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T03:36:48Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200618,"name":"Caleb Otieno","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caleb Otieno B. is a businessman who sells clothes in Migori, Kenya.

They do this to get ahead with their families.  \r\n\r\nThey live in the city of Cuenca, which is 2,500 meters above sea level.  It is situated in a great valley within the Andes mountain range.  It is surrounded by four rivers; Tomebamba, Yanuncay, Mach\u00e1ngara and Tarqui; that start at the Cajas junction.  The rivers create spaces in the valley of Guapondelig in the town of Ca\u00f1ari.

The two share the initiative to get ahead and  have a comfortable life.  Her goal is surprising because despite being so young to be a mother, she takes on the role with perserverance and makes sure that her son doesn't lack for anything.  That is why every morning she sells \u201cpatasca\u201d, a typical food of their area that is made with flour and meat), parboiled lima beans, fried pork skin and chicha (the typical Peruvian drink) in a small stand that she has.  But at nights she sells candies and sweets on a corner of the main square of Santa Ana.  This is how she has succeeded in working for two years and that her business is profitable, since her goal is to build a house with the land that they were given.\r\nOn the other hand, her partner works in carpentry and his earnings help cover the household expenses and with his income, they are able to save to fulfill their goal.\r\nIn the future she wants to build a large store so that she can sell both wholesale and retail.  She would also like to sell prepared food because she likes to cook\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she appreciates the trust that the members of the communal group have in her.

They live together in a cozy home that they own, located in a commercial neighborhood of the city of Santa Ana.  Her occupation is preparing \"caldo de gallina\" (chicken boiled in pieces with potatoes, vegetables and noodles), pancakes, coffee and various foods of the area that are much sought after by discerning diners.  Her husband, on the other hand, works in public transportation using a motocar (light 3-wheeled passenger vehicle) that he owns.  In this way, together they can cover the household expenses and pay for the education  and basic needs of their children.  She has 23 years of experience selling food in the evenings from a food cart that she positions near a bus stop.  In addition, she has 3 motocars that they rent to third parties, and with all of these sources of income they live comfortably.  As she is a businesswoman, she wants to set up a bar in her home.  Her main wish is to have a poller\u00eda (chicken restaurant), that she could run along with her husband and sons.  This is the first time that she has had a loan from MFP, and she is very enthusiastic about belonging to a communal group that is so well organized.  In addition, she pays attention to the decisions made by the members of her group.

She has worked with Emprender for a long time without any problems, so she has been given the Kiva interest rate.  \r\n<p>\r\nFabiola is a hardworking person.  Since she is contributing to the household expenses by herself, one of her wishes is to buy a car to use as a taxi so that she can earn more income.  Fabiola will use the money from her loan to buy pork so that she can prepare her delicious traditional sandwiches.    She is extremely grateful to Emprender and Kiva for demonstrating their confidence in her by providing this loan.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":539942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase pork","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabiola Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":39.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200642,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, es una mujer muy trabajadora, tiene 45 a\u00f1os, viven con uno de sus 5 hijos en su vivienda propia junto a su esposo Jorge de 50 a\u00f1os.

Juana, their 14 year old daughter, is in junior high school, and Jonathan, their nine year old son, is in elementary school.\r\n\r\nOlivia sells limes, mangos and papaya in quantity.  There are very few people who sell these items during the months of May, June, and July, when her sales and income are greatest.  She is very dedicated to her work, as this is her only source of income.  \r\n\r\nOlivia used the money from this loan to invest in limes, mangos and papaya.  She is happy because now her business will increase.  One of her dreams is to start a packing business, including a vehicle with which to transport her products.  She is also happy to be working with the others who share this loan, because they are very responsible and they trust one another.  She is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the service and support they have given her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

Thanks to their marriage, they have successfully built their own home. Julia has worked with her husband in his small workshop in the production of handbags and purses for 10 years. But she has also been a cattle dealer for 15 years, since her parents were engaged in this activity. And she sells milk from her cows to neighbors in the community. \r\n\r\nJulia has worked for five years with loans from the foundation and that made construction of her house possible. With this new credit she will buy fabrics, zippers, thread, buckles and other supplies to make portfolios and bags. Her goal is to open a store in her home. \r\n\r\nMaria Cecilia has been a member of the bank for 11 years. She is 45 years old, married, and the mother of 8 children, 5 of whom are married and 3 single. They all live in their own homes, thanks to her effort with her husband. The last 2 children are still in school but they help with work at home and provide for expenses. They help their father who also works as driver of an inter-provincial bus. Maria Cecilia has been selling pork for 20 years in her own stall in the Open Market on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays from 6 am to 6 pm. With her new loan, she will buy more pigs for slaughtering and market the meat. Her big dream is to see her children happy and every day forging ahead.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

Here, everyone knows the \u201cLos Pajaritos\u201d [Little Birds] store owned by Osvaldo O. P., 42 years of age. His father started the business 30 years ago when he lost his job. He began selling household food products and miscellaneous items. At that time, Osvaldo\u2019s brother worked at the store, and Osvaldo has been in charge for the last five years. With much discipline and effort, he has managed to make a living. \r\n\r\nAlthough Los Pajaritos sells groceries and household items, on the weekends cold drinks make up the greatest volume of sales and profits, making the business profitable for the whole month. Also, the customers like that the prices are lower than those offered by the competition.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo is applying for his third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy grocery items like sugar, rice, flour, canned goods, grains, and cooking oil in bulk. By buying in quantity, he can get special discounts and stock up the store. With his previous loans, he was able to get the business off the ground, as it had been stagnant due to a lack of working capital. Now, Osvaldo can offer a wide variety of products to his customers.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo\u2019s dreams and goals are to increase his income to provide for his family. For this reason, all of his loan will be invested in the store, to keep it growing. For Osvaldo, life has constant challenges. Sometimes he feels that he needs more money for things he desires, but because he has many responsibilities, he knows he must wait.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk,

With her new loan she will buy more chickens, guinea pigs, and food for them.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Sarbelia C., age 51, is a very happy and charismatic member of the group.  This is her second loan.  She will buy baby chickens and food to enlarge her animal farm.  She has been doing this for a long time.  She also has a dairy cow, and she sells her production in her community.\r\n\r\nShe lives in the Cumbe parish with her husband and four of their five children.  The third daughter got married and lives independently.  Two of her children work and help economically with the household expenses.  They also help with the educational expenses of her last daughter, who goes to the local school.  Her second daughter does not work, but she helps with the household chores.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have more animals in her farmyard.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Jimenez spends his day-to-day life in the production and commercial sale of change purses, key rings, belts, purses, and wallets made of leather and leather-like material (shown in the photo above). He is 48 years old, a resident of neighborhood 20 in Julio, a place full of businesses and families that is very close to the big city of Barranquilla, the center of soccer in Columbia. Lenin is married and has two children, of ages 15 and 18. His family is dedicated to working hard so that they can achieve a better life. \r\n\r\nLenin started his business in 1995 after many years of working as a salesman for another business, an apprenticeship he endured to learn the art of making leather products, during which he slowly perfected his trade and strengthened his business skills. He works near his house in a busy commercial district so that his wife and children can also work in their free time. Their work schedules are extensive, starting production in their small home workshop at 5:00 am, and then selling their products from 2:00 pm to 9:00 pm on Mondays through Sundays. They are located near the metropolitan area in one of the biggest, most important commercial districts south of Barranquilla. There is not a lot of competition in the area, so Lenin sells to retailers at wholesale and also has a shop where he sells retail. \r\n\r\nThis will be his fourth loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo and he needs 1.300.000 to buy wholesale products including leather, other leather material, and accessories to decorate his final products, in a new line that he will bring to the market. His previous loans allowed his home and business to be better located, with a ceiling, a floor, and walls for appropriate for a production space. Likewise, with this loan, he will increase production and strengthen his sales. His short-term dream is to buy a stamping machine so that he can rent it out and be able to educate his children, as they would like to study engineering and get their high school diplomas. \r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Heyd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":539294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase leather, leather products, and accessories to decorate his final products at wholesale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-17T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lenin Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":195717},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":210266},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":214296},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":218403},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222589},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":238729}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.27},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.62,"local_amount":195717,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":200958.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636189,"comment":null},{"amount":109.18,"local_amount":210266,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":215896.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850284,"comment":null},{"amount":111.27,"local_amount":214296,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":220034.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117044,"comment":null},{"amount":61.13,"local_amount":117733,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":120885.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410913,"comment":null},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":100670,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":103365.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550573,"comment":null},{"amount":239.53,"local_amount":461318,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":473671.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688171,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-18T01:49:33Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200669,"name":"Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuel M.

Together they live in a small village located in the beautiful rainforest town of Ayacucho where they have their own house on a wood foundation. Eudosia has always placed a high priority on the quality of her agricultural products. She grows cocoa beans and stays busy with this responsibility and frequently tries out new methods of agriculture. From a young age, her parents offered her a small piece of land where she could experiment and grow products. Now thanks to the help of her husband, she now gets a lot out of her land, whereas before she could not realistically grow enough to cover the needs of her family. Currently, she has a bigger piece of land and has improved her sales from the past. Eudosia recognizes that she has been given the first step toward achieving success and she aspires to expand her cocoa bean sales to strategic places that will earn her more profits. In general, she sells her products by the bunch in the central market of her town. For the most part, she works with her husband, but during the sowing and harvesting season, she hires laborers to help with the work. This is her fourth loan with MFP and she promises that she will responsibly make all of her payments. Moreover, she appreciates the partnership with the community bank that is there for all community members.

Together they have 2 children with whom they live in a rented house located in the central rain forest of Peru.  He is a very energetic and hard-working person (it's not for nothing they say \u201c1,000 skills\u201d), since he performs with great responsibility the activities of agriculture, construction, and even in his free time, public transport with his motorcycle-taxi. \r\n\r\nSamuel has been working like this for 12 years.  And in addition, his wife helps by caring for their coffee and plantain trees. What Samuel likes best is to see his land always well cared for.  But to achieve this, requires much effort clearing weeds from the fields.\r\n\r\nHis greatest hope is to construct his own house on land he owns.  Also, he wishes to continue growing quality produce in quantity.  This is his 2nd loan with MFP and he assures us that he likes working with his communal group because it feels like family, since the members are very united and responsible.  In addition,  they teach him to value his professions.  With this loan he will buy various sacks of manure to care for his crops and, in this manner, avoid attacks by diseases and climate variations.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims,

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Melania joined SPBD. This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Melania's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

 P. is 41 and married with three children (ages 7 - 19).  She is starting a business, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Tamasailau  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tamasailau  joined SPBD.  This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tamasailau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

His house has been adapted into a store where he has 12 computers, each in their own wooden cabinets and operates 3 mobile phone lines. With these he offers internet and phone services to local, national and international destinations. As in Villa Katanga and its surrounding areas there are few businesses that offer internet services, and it is very economical to make calls to mobiles, Luis Carlos' store is always very full of customers who come from several areas nearby. Most of the time they have to wait for the equipment to become free, so that they can access the services he offers. This is the reason why he is asking for his third loan, because he wants to buy computer equipment and systems and a couple of telephone lines. \r\nLuis Carlos  started out as an entrepreneur in 1997 when he used to sell records door to door and his business already had a name,  \u201cDiscos Carlos\u201d. It was then that he started his relationship with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation with a $600,000 loan and he started up a record shop in his home. After a time he changed business, when selling records stopped being a good business. Therefore he suspended his loans and later when he started the business he currently has, three years ago, he began his credit relationship with this organization again.  And that was how he allocated a space in his home for his new business and since he received his loan his life has changed, because he was able purchase his home and buy fixed assets. His new dream is to consolidate his business and make it the preferred site for his customers. His biggest challenge is to buy a home to separate his commercial space from his family life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":540004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"To buy computer equipment and systems and a couple of telephone lines.

 T. is 30 and married with five children (ages 6 - 19).  She is starting a business, selling local Samoan snacks such as palusami (coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves), cooked taro, yams, and soupo ese (hearty papaya soup).  Tekauaita  needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tekauaita  joined SPBD. This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tekauaita's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 55 and married with three children (ages 18 - 25).  She owns a business, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Fao has many years of experience in this business.  Fao needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Fao joined SPBD. This is her fourth loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Lilia owns and operates a general store. She has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately $163 a month from this activity. Her husband is a barber. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lilia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Lilia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 5th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 55 years old and married. Nacar is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Nacar owns and operates a piggery. Nacar has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $234 a month from this activity. Her husband is a carpenter.\r\n\r\n In 2008, Nacar joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Nacar is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used to purchase pigs and feed for them. This will be her 4th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 59 years old. Monica is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMonica is married and has seven adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling household items in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $200 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Monica joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,700 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase rice. Monica is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to provide the needs of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":536431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

G. is from the village of Tuburan.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing hairdressing and beauty services to local community members. Rutchel has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rutchel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rutchel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. Rutchel is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the  loan taken out by Rutchel from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Serino Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nida S. is from the village of Katipunan, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental. She is 38 years old. Nida is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Nida S. Group.\r\n\r\nNida is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Nida owns and operates a business venture in the agricultural sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Nida has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nida joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to pay for services to increase crop yield. Nida is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP that will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Nida from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":537497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizers such as manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Katipunan Sinacaban Mis.

With her loan she is planning on buying a significant quantity of skins from butchers in Sikasso, Mopti and Koury; she sells them in Accra, the capital of Ghana, to a diverse and varied customer base, which in turn prepares the skins to eat or to sell. \r\n\r\nWhile the members of the group expect to make a monthly profit of 110,000FCFA each during the course of the cycle, A\u00efcha N. expects to make 150,000FCFA.\r\n\r\nAs well as repaying their loans, they use a part of their income to cover their families' everyday expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

He is married and the father of 12 children. He lives at home in the Dabani borough of the San Prefecture (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nOver 20 years ago, he opted for the commerce of televisions and related accessories, a business he learned from his older brother. For the past ten years he has been running his own business at the main market in San. He is in high demand, particularly during the weekly market fairs in San and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nTo diversify his activities, he decided two years ago to call upon the Soro Yiriwaso MFI. He is requesting a third individual loan, having fully reimbursed the two preceding ones. Mr. Abdoulaye will use this loan to buy different televisions, DVD and VCD players (with 14, 21, and 26-inch screens).\r\n\r\nHe used to get his supplies from wholesalers in San, but as he increased his working capital, he now would like to go as far as Lom\u00e9 (the capital of Togo). He sells in his shop at San\u2019s main market and in weekly market fairs, to a customer base of both men and women, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nHe is hoping to attain monthly earnings of 175,000 FCFA he will use to reimburse the loan, pay his children\u2019s tuition fees, buy food, and reinvest the remainder in other revenue-generating activities.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":540151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"buy electronic appliances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":170121.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961545,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699664,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85061,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913553,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180713,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85061.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476685,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T21:20:28Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200749,"name":"Nakinyuguzi 2 Kakembo Hellen Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen K.  is a hardworking businesswoman of fifty years, married with five children who are in school.

He is married and the father of two children. He lives at home in the Santoro I borough of the San Prefecture.\r\n\r\nSidiki practices the commerce of cola nuts, both wholesale and retail, learned from his father over ten years ago. He has been running his own business at the main market in San for the past five years, and is in high demand during the weekly market fairs in San and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nTo diversify his activities, he decided to call upon the Soro Yiriwaso MFI. He is now requesting a second individual loan.\r\n\r\nMr. Sidiki wants to buy 30 baskets of cola nuts. He used to get his supplies from wholesale merchants in San, but as he increased his working capital, he now would like to go as far as Bouak\u00e9 (Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire).

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, her two co-spouses and their children, in the M\u00e9dina Coura neighborhood in the town of Koutiala (Sikasso Region).\r\n\r\nNot having had the chance to pursue brilliant studies, she's been earning money since her youth, which she learned from her mother. After trying several businesses, she finally settled for buying and selling firewood. With 20 years of experience in this market, she's very much in demand and can sell several truckloads of firewood in one week.\r\n\r\nTo bolster her business, Mrs. Fatoumata turned to Kiva's partner, the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from which she's seeking her first individual loan. With this loan, she intends to buy four truckloads of firewood in the villages surrounding Koutiala, in order to resell them at the market in Koutiala, on credit or for cash, to a clientele comprising both men and women.\r\n\r\nShe intends to turn a monthly profit of XOF 80'000 (ca US$ 150), to be used to repay the loan and contribute to the family's small expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

fatherhood\u201d is a term that has been converted into concrete fact in Hiloliddin D.'s life. He has always responded satisfactorily to his role as provider for his two children, for whom he cares with much love, in the company of his wife, who is always supportive of him. Hiloliddin works in agricultural activities and has some cattle. At the moment, he is working intensively at his agricultural activities and taking care of his fields. His wife is helping take care of the cows and also sells their milk. They do all this hard work because they want to give an education to each of their two children. They would also like to open a small business some day; until then they will continue working in their fields. To do this, Hiloliddin is requesting a loan of 8000 Somoni to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

R. is a married woman and has three children. She has been running her own business for 3 years already. Kholiskhon, together with the help of her son (pictured), sells clothes for women in a store, which is located in one of the heavily inhabited parts of the city. She is very nice and polite and has many clients. The business is quite stable and serves as a significant source of income for the family. Kholiskhon has been a client of IMON for almost a year and this is her second loan from our organization. She managed to pay all her loans accurately and precisely. Now she requests $3000 USD. Kholiskhon is planning to purchase women's summer clothes to sell. She deeply appreciates your support and sincerely thanks all of you. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Today Adolfo\u2019s business has gotten back on its feet but he lacks capital and he doesn\u2019t have sufficient resources to serve his customers well.\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy chairs and tables in order to provide his customers with better service.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":540217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Operating capital (to buy chairs and tables) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-05-16T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":176.76,"local_amount":176.76,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":176.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872819,"comment":null},{"amount":23.24,"local_amount":23.24,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":23.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159612849,"comment":null},{"amount":148.95,"local_amount":148.95,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":148.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166827138,"comment":null},{"amount":56.66,"local_amount":56.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":56.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093458,"comment":null},{"amount":194.39,"local_amount":194.39,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":194.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523315,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657823,"comment":null},{"amount":107.08,"local_amount":107.08,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":107.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191401074,"comment":null},{"amount":107.51,"local_amount":107.51,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":107.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195819394,"comment":null},{"amount":190.06,"local_amount":190.06,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":190.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211200981,"comment":null},{"amount":95.35,"local_amount":95.35,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":95.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479493,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-14T19:47:52Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:45:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200807,"name":"Nyame Mmre Trust Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica is a 41-year-old woman who describes herself as hard-working.

Women entrepreneurs are still a minority in Lebanon, but this borrower has not only established her own business but also employs five full-time workers. The loan officer notes that she is very active and has a strong reputation for her high-quality work. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan of $1.200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. She plans to use the loan to perform maintenance work on her sewing machines. She currently owns seven sewing machines. She told the loan officer that she invests her profits in her business and to recruit new employees. Her story is one great example of how microfinance can positively impact women entrepreneurs and assist in job creation.\r\n<p>\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.).

Her dream is to sell her products in large markets.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":540246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"Wholesale purchase of colored yarn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-05-17T01:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rogelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obdulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5100,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":849.98},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":849.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":849.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":849.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":849.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":850.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.99},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":299.99,"local_amount":849.98,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T07:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":850.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152158179,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":849.98,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":850.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159629864,"comment":null},{"amount":599.98,"local_amount":1699.96,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-18T07:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1701.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166843910,"comment":null},{"amount":299.99,"local_amount":849.98,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":850.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110098,"comment":null},{"amount":300.04,"local_amount":850.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":850.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177403390,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-17T09:36:56Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:50:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200820,"name":"Kyandago Development B, Kihihi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Operating a tea plantation has really transformed his life.

This will enable him earn more revenue and be able to maintain a self-sustaining life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":539763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"To expand his business through marketing and opening up new locations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-25T13:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sadures","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evaristo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Precious","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doroth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Conslanta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2750000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":687500},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":687500},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":687500},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":687500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":590.91,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1317276.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662460,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":687500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":696636.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689235,"comment":null},{"amount":338.41,"local_amount":744500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":754393.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903398,"comment":null},{"amount":8.18,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":18239.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297402,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T18:40:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200824,"name":"Migyera Development B, Kihihi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In this world, one needs a pinch of extra effort and hard work to earn a living, especially in this era of stiff competition.

she works from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m.  With the loan she\u2019s requesting she wants to buy CDs and cleaning products for her business.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to increase the number of products she sells, and also finish building her house.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva

For more than 6 years, she has grown coffee and plantains.  She does this with her husband, and they both have the goal of offering a better quality of life to their children.  She wakes up very early every morning to prepare breakfast for her children, and later goes off to her fields.  What she likes best is to weed her fields, however, having to place traps for the pests is very dangerous and difficult for her.  On the other hand, she realizes that this activity is very profitable, and thanks to this she has built her house.

She is 48-years-old and lives with Elias, who is 56-years-old.  Together they have six children, and live with two of them in their own home.  For more than 30 years, she and her husband have grown crops such as avocadoes, plantains, pineapple, and coffee.  She really enjoys the tranquility of her farmhouse, but taking care of her crops can be very burdensome, since she has to weed her fields.  Together with her farming, she prepares a variety of dishes which she sells from her house, and in this way she generates additional income, along with what she earns farming.  Thanks to that income, she could buy her things, cover the educational costs of her children, and pay her household costs.  This is why she is thinking about finishing building her house and putting in a restaurant in the future, and she would also like to plant more coffee and plantains.  \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is very thankful for the trust that they continue to place in her.

They all live in their own home.  For 11 years, she has had a grocery store, and she has always tried to make sure that her store is well stocked with the merchandise necessary to meet her customers\u2019 needs.  Her store is very busy with a large number of customers.  Teresa works hard to give them good customer service, which keeps them coming back again and again.  She enjoys her work very much because it gives her enough time to take care of her household chores, and as long as she keeps the door open to her store, she can be at home working, while her clients choose what they\u2019d like to buy.  In the future, Teresa wants to continue improving her business, and that is why she needs more capital.  This is the seventh loan she has had with MFP, and she has always been very punctual with her payments.  Teresa is thinking about investing the money in buying candy, soft drinks, and cookies, among other foods, to satisfy her clientele\u2019s needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun

They have five children and live in a rented home located in the city of Santa Ana.  For the past ten years, Soledad has been raising bananas and coffee.  She also buys and sells bananas from her home, while her husband works as on an estate, earning only 20 PEN a day.  What she likes the most about her business is that it gives her enough time to gather firewood to be able to cook for her children.  She wants them to be well cared for and to later learn this trade and help to grow the business.\r\n\r\nWith the income this couple is expecting, they will be able to build a home of their own and open a store where they can sell bananas.  For Soledad, this is important because it will allow her to give a better quality of life to her children.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan through MFP and since she is already familiar with how the communal group works, she feels comfortable working alongside its members, who always look out for each other.  She will use the money from this loan to buy more bananas, in order to be able to diversify her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

She is very happy to make these improvements on her small house with the hard work of her children and her husband, since allof them cooperate for their common wellbeing. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":540421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"She will finish buying construction materials to finish a small porch and make the improvement ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-05-18T10:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.18,"local_amount":1056.32,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151822089,"comment":null},{"amount":48.34,"local_amount":1017.7,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562099,"comment":null},{"amount":48.88,"local_amount":1029.15,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1037.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771008,"comment":null},{"amount":47.44,"local_amount":998.72,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204899,"comment":null},{"amount":47.89,"local_amount":1008.25,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330596,"comment":null},{"amount":48.4,"local_amount":1018.93,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1026.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465752,"comment":null},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":985.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":992.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097891,"comment":null},{"amount":48.21,"local_amount":1014.98,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348496,"comment":null},{"amount":47.98,"local_amount":1010.16,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766169,"comment":null},{"amount":40.88,"local_amount":860.46,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":867.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209248,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-09T06:24:41Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200930,"name":"Teodora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teodora tiene 48 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy emprendedora y caritativa, est\u00e1 casada con Jorge de 64 a\u00f1os, juntos tienen 8 hijos pero s\u00f3lo vive con 6 de ellos en su casa propia.

She is married to Jorge, who is 64. Together they have 8 children but she only lives with 6 of them in her own home. She works in carpentry. She starts very early. Her husband makes the designs, cutting the wood and giving form to the furniture, while Teodora does the necessary finishings: sanding doors, windows, dressers, desks, beds, among others. What she likes the most is working in her husband's company. She affirms that being co-workers has united the couple more, sharing accomplishments and failures. This profession is very profitable because with the earnings they were able to pay for their children's education, buy land, build their house, and buy a motorcycle cab that they rent and which brings in extra income. This is why she is very enthusiastic about growing the carpentry shop; she also hopes to finish building more rooms in her residence. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is very enthusiastic about continuing to work in her community group, where she is president of the board of directors. With the loan she is asking for, she will buy wood to continue making furniture. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

Olmos is an agricultural and commercial region comprised of residents who live in small, dispersed rural areas.  It belongs to the Lambayeque province, located more than two hours from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n\r\nFor more than five years, he has dedicated himself to cultivating passion fruit, a popular crop of that region.  Farmers have started to join forces in order to more easily position their products in the markets.  Small agricultural cooperatives exist presently that support each other and harvest their fruit several times each year.  This is especially true at harvest time, when fruit might be picked several times per month.  Pedro would like to apply some nutrients and fertilizers to his crops in order to improve his production.  This will help him ensure a good income to help his family get ahead.  This is why he has solicited his first loan of 1,000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nPedro is a farmer who enjoys his work a great deal, and it has helped him support his family.

She hopes that by the end of the year she can change her grocery store completely and have it very well stocked. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":540444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy beans, butter, rice, sugar, milk, coffee, bread, cookies, corn and flour tortillas, margarine, toilet paper, sanitary napkins, salt, condiments, eggs, soap, soup and grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-05-16T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Azucena Altagracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":803.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152086227,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":803.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159800075,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":803.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166905215,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":803.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172173061,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":803.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177469088,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607113,"comment":null},{"amount":127.5,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2409.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189188847,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

They have no children and live together in the house that they own.  For 16 years, along with Yolanda, Jose has made a living selling grocery products.  The business is located in one of the markets in their neighborhood.  The work is fairly easy because the experience of so many years has taught them what their customers want and what products they have to stock to satisfy demand.  Unfortunately, they can't stock all of their products at the market because thieves sometimes break in there at night and steal whatever they find.  Consequently, they keep most of their products at their house and only leave at the business what they have to.  They hope to improve the security of their market stall in the future, as well as improve the incomes they pull from the business.

They live in their own house with the 3 of their children who still live at home.  She started, more than 25 years ago, planting pineapple and coffee on land that she owns, a business that she operates with help from her husband.  During harvest season, she also hires laborers who help with the very difficult job of harvesting the crops.  She and her husband would like to improve the quality of their products.  What she most likes about farming is spreading manure on the land because taking care of the land ensures a good crop even when weather and disease cut into her output.  She proudly says that farming is her main source of income, an income that has made it possible for her to build a house and live without having to give up basic necessities.

is 50 years old and is the single mother of six children aged between 16 and 32 years. Two of her children are attending school.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is a farmer from Western Kenya near Kitale town. She has been farming for twenty years, producing vegetables, tomatoes, milk and eggs which she sells to the local market. She relies solely on her income from farming to cater for her family's needs.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is one of the many active clients of Juhudi Kilimo and recently completed her fourth loan. She has requested this new loan of KES 50,000 to expand her poultry project and construct a dairy unit.

is 52 years old and married with eight children aged from 12 to 32 years. Two of her children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nMary is a farmer from Western Kenya near Kitale town. She has been farming for twenty-five years and has only one employee. Her main produce consists of maize, beans, avocados, passion fruit and sugarcane which she sells to the local market. She also sells dairy cows to the local market and earns income from a tailoring shop she owns in the area.\r\n\r\nMary is one of the many active clients in Juhudi Kilimo, having recently completed her fifth loan of KES 50,000. She has requested this new loan from Juhudi for KES 80,000 to purchase a tractor. This tractor will help her in her farming activities.\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s biggest challenge in farming came when she started to practice dairy farming since she did not have the know-how to keep dairy animals.

His main challenges in the farming business are lack of security for the chickens, poultry diseases and lack of management expertise.\r\n\r\nZebedee has requested this KES 50,000 loan from Juhudi Kilimo to expand his poultry project.

He entered into a partnership and opened a business making shower enclosures; this lasted only six months.  He then met a big challenge with a new locale in the Kennedy neighborhood called \u201cVidrios el Rey,\u201d a glazier shop where he makes shower enclosures and general cabinetry.  His greatest challenge was dissolving the partnership because he lost a lot of money and was decapitalized.  But, he continued to offer his services and has managed to move ahead.\r\n\r\nThis will be his 1st loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy raw materials for cabinet making like, glass and aluminum; he will also use it to repair his sandblaster, which is equipment that shoots abrasive materials under pressure to bring about changes on rigid surfaces like the ones Ferney uses as his main raw ingredients: glass, marble, acrylic, wood and steel.  With this equipment he will be able to optimize results, have more uniformity, lessen labor costs, minimize job completion time, insure better finish adherence and anchoring and attain more purity in the materials with a minimum of effort.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to own his own house to enjoy with his wife and two children, who are 5 and 10 years of age, as well as to acquire a vehicle to transport merchandise for his business because to date he leases this service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":540769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":" To buy cabinet making raw materials like glass and aluminum;
