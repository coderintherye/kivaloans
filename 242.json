is single with four children. She lives in Ntamulung quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon. L. and her entire family live in a house with eight rooms, one sitting room and a kitchen. Being a very hard working woman, L. had to overcome some challenges in life such as taking care of her children, especially as she is living in her parents house. It is not easy for her living there with other family members and children.\r\n\r\nL. runs a call centre, an embroidery business and also sells food supplements  in front of their compound with the support of her children. She plans to invest this loan in her existing businesses of call centre, food supplement and embroidery. She plans to expand these businesses since she has been doing them for a number of years. \r\n\r\nThis will be L.\u2019s fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2005. She has been quite successful in the past with her businesses due to her location (right on the main road), the quality of her products, and her reasonable prices. Also, with her experience, she is now having more customers who buy her products.\r\n \r\nPart of her profits from this loan will be used to buy a plot where she will construct a house in the future for her and the children. And another part will be used to improve her farm. L. does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments every month. She intends to start repayment in the fourth month after taking the loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

I. is a married mother of three, living in Geneku, Cameroon. She has been a member of GHAPE since 2006 and has borrowed from the organization twice before. Through these loans, she has been able to establish for herself a restaurant and bar.\n\nThrough her first two loans, Gladys has seen her home life improve, has been able to pay school fees, provide for her family, and has been able to give them better food. In addition to that, Gladys is now able to ensure that her family will have access to quality medical care.\n\nFollowing her first and second loans, Gladys has requested another loan from GHAPE. This time around, she is requesting 150,000 Fcfa from the organization. With this next loan, Gladys hopes to be able to expand her restaurant and include a provisions store where beer will also be sold.\n\nBy expanding her business, not only will Gladys be making more money and be helping her family, but she will also be providing a valuable service to different members of the community. As it stands right now, some members of the community need to travel long distances just to be able to get something to eat. By expanding her business, Gladys will be able to shorten the distance that many people have to travel in order to eat, and thus will be improving the quality of life of those folks.\n\nGladys\u2019s business is sure to succeed with these new developments, simply on account of the fact that there are a couple of primary and secondary schools nearby where teachers, students and families often pass by. Beyond this, she has been experiencing an increase in business lately as more customers are patronizing her restaurant. With more services to offer, she is almost sure of further growth and success.\n\nGladys chooses to work with GHAPE empowerment credits not only because of the favorable terms of the loans, such as the low interest rates and lack of requisite collateral, but also because of the ability for borrowers to make payments over time, thus relieving the financial burden on individual borrowers, and freeing them from a potential debt trap or cycle.\n\n\nAbout GHAPE\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":349214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To expand her

She has four children. She works selling basic grains. She has run this business for more than six years. Her shop is located in her home. Her business is run with little capital, but with much desire to get ahead. She must pay her household expenses as well as provide food and education for her children. Little by little she has increased her inventory using the small income her business generates. Her customers return to her shop because Martha is very helpful and always attends to her customers with a smile. The funds she is requesting will be used as capital to purchase rice, sugar, beans, oil and corn. Her greatest dream is for her children to complete their studies and get ahead. With this work she is able to help them succeed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristen Beck, Kiva

When she got sick, her son took over the business--its popularity is due to the efforts of his mother. \r\n\r\nBecause of the difficulties that Presentaci\u00f3n has faced such as the economic crisis, he is seeking a loan for working capital and to buy corn, masa (corn flour), firewood etc. His greatest dream is to expand and improve his business so that his children can continue this way of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":349290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-08T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Presentacion Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599974,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035863,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948257,"comment":null},{"amount":0.14,"local_amount":2.77,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790187,"comment":null},{"amount":132.73,"local_amount":2589.91,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2627.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790188,"comment":null},{"amount":129.79,"local_amount":2532.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2569.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680854,"comment":null},{"amount":127.87,"local_amount":2495.01,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075390,"comment":null},{"amount":121.99,"local_amount":2379.81,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2414.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911440,"comment":null},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947287,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T17:13:35Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":120731,"name":"Success","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Success A. is married and her husband is a petty trader.

She has been selling clothing for over seven years. She began this small business because a friend gave her merchandise like shoes and clothing for her to distribute to different customers. After two years she decided to start on her own and with a great deal of effort she achieved self-independence and had her own business. The loan that she requests is for the purchase of skirts, shirts, pants, and dresses. Her dream is to keep moving forward with her business since she already faces a lot of problems because she didn\u2019t have anyone\u2019s help. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laurie

In a community where most people get around on their own motorcycle (here just called a \"motor\") or by hiring a motorcycle driver (called a \"motoconcho\"), Armando's business has no want of customers. \r\n\r\nYet, Armando is not quite like any of the other motorcycle repairmen in the city. At 8 months old, Armando suffered a terrible fall off of a bed, and has since been unable to walk without the help of leg braces and prosthetics. Despite these constraints, Armando maintains a sunny outlook on life, which makes him very popular in the neighborhood of Ginandiana where he lives and works. Armando also has dreams for his business: he says that he hopes to expand his workshop over time, and he aspires to someday be a great businessman.\r\n\r\nThis is Armando's first loan from Kiva and Esperanza International, and he intends to invest the loan in his business and buy additional motorcycle replacement parts for his shop.

expand her business. She has proven herself extremely credit-worthy and is now on her sixth loan. With this loan she will buy more supplies to make more empanadas, which she sells to her friends, to stores and on the street. Her business has grown so much with these loans that she has been able to buy a motorcycle which allows her to distribute her empanadas to even more locations. \r\n\r\nJuana is the single mother of three children, aged 13, 10, and 8. She says it has been very difficult raising all of them by herself but, with the growth of her business from her loans, she has been able to provide them with enough food and can afford to send them to school. She hopes to continue to grow her businesses so that one day she can send her children to college. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Juana and the entire La Union en Progreso group, thank you for providing

While this is the third loan that Luz has taken out with Esperanza International, it is the first loan for many of the other women in her group.\r\n\r\nLuz took out her first group loan in February 2008 and has consistently and persistently made her payments. However, the previous members of her group struggled to accept the responsibilities associated with microfinance and thus the group suffered from solidarity and cooperation problems. Esperanza International utilizes group lending, which means that the other members of the group are held responsible if one member defaults. Luz is excited because she has great hope for the responsibility and solidarity of this new group. She shared that it is directly evident that these women are ready to flourish with the opportunity that microfinance provides and are simultaneously ready to be dependable group members.\r\n\r\nIn February 2008, Luz ran a colmado, a small store that sells primarily durable goods and foods such as rice and potatoes. Almost a year and a half later, Luz now runs a cafeteria where she sells a variety of lunch foods including fresh juices, fried chicken, empanadas (a pastry turnover filled with savory ingredients and baked or fried), and tostados (a tortilla fried in deep fat with various fillings piled on it). Currently, Luz is unable to satisfy the demands of her customers (certainly a good problem to have); thus, she will use her loan to purchase more primary materials so she can expand the amount of food she produces with her mother.\r\n\r\nLuz hopes to use her increased profits to not only expand her business but also to save up to replace her tin roof with a more stable cement block roof since it rains frequently in Los Alcarrizos. This new roof will truly be a manifestation of the stability and improvement that microfinance can foster.\r\n\r\nLuz lives with her husband, who sells construction materials, and her two children (4 and 6). She is excited for her children\u2019s future and wants them to grow up studying hard, attending church, and making good friends. The children are not the only ones studying in this family. In fact, Luz has been taking night classes in the capital. While she is currently between sessions, she plans to resume classes in August. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Luz N., the Bank of Hope Encuento con Dios, and the microfinance institute Esperanza International, thank you for providing opportunities to those who need it most!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":349316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Carmen began selling these dishes 26 years ago with very little money, buying only a few kilos of meat and over time, with her savings, she was able to buy her own animals.  Each morning, she cleans and takes care of her animals because she spends the afternoons and weekends preparing the food and selling it on the main streets, at festivities, or at any social event in her area.

She lives in her mother\u2019s house with her partner, the father of her 2 children, and they intend to marry. Every day they tend to the crops raised on their farm.  Ever since she was little, Marlene wakes up at 4am to help her mother prepare lunch for the many laborers who work in the fields planting potatoes and peas. Along with her husband, not only does she help plant the crops, but she also sells them. \r\n<p>\r\nMarlene is a lighthearted woman who is very attentive to her customers. When her crops are ready to be sold, she is in charge of making deals with traders in the wholesale market, always looking to get the best price and generate more income.  Meanwhile, her husband is responsible for taking orders and keeping track of the sacks of produce.  With her potato crops, she prefers to ship them to the wholesale markets in Lima because she can earn bigger profits over there.  The extra income helps to cover her food bill and her children\u2019s education expenses. At a later point, Marlene thinks she should buy more farmland to increase her crop yield. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan from MFP, and the payments from her previous loans have been on time.  She tries not to miss her communal bank meetings, where she is regarded by the other group members. The money she requested will be used to buy chemical fertilizers for her crops of potatoes and peas.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":349363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-09T05:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3045,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959556,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-17T16:47:19Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":120756,"name":"Suma Yawar Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cSuma Yawar\u201d es una Asociaci\u00f3n Comunal con casi 7 a\u00f1os de vida, su presidenta es Teodosia T., ella menciona  que a las integrantes del grupo les gusta asistir a las reuniones porque comparten, hablan y se olvidan de sus problemas.

She is also into selling \"Ready to Wear\" clothing of GTY.

Venus has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase dried fish to sell. Venus is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP as additional capital for her businesses. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L., 27, is from the village of Santa Cruz, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Leah owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products in the local community. Leah has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns ~5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leah joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leah is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP to invest in expanding the business. This will be her first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Jovelyn has just started this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovelyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP to purchase raw ingredients such as peanuts to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jovelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family\u2019s general living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Gina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Gina from GDMPC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

E. is from the village of Panduma Sr., Tukuran, Zamoanga del Sur. She is 43 years old. Merlina is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Merlina owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector, operating a sari-sari, or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Merlina has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Merlina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Merlina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Merlina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and pay the tuition of children. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jenette joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nJenette is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase pig feed and other supplies. This loan will be her third from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to pay for the tuition of her children. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

A. is the mother of three. She is married to Benigno, 52 years old and a fisherman. She lives in the island village in the town of Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAs a woman of dreams, in 1995 Leoncia joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. During the length of her membership in ASHI, she has been very active as a member, and became the leader of their center. She has been very wise in spending her previous loans.\r\n\r\nNow on her 14th loan, Leoncia requests the amount of 45,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish pond. 29,500 pesos of her loan will be used for her fish pond while the remaining amount will be spent on her secondary businesses: direct selling and tricycle(rickshaw) transportation.\r\n\r\nLeoncia is hopeful that she can establish a strong, sound and profitable business so that she is able to help her grandchildren with their school fees someday, and build a more durable and spacious house. She dreams also of expanding her fish pond.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":349598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase three

Eva has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Eva joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eva has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Eva is requesting a new loan of 40000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Eva from PMPC.

C. is a 64-year-old woman who hails from the beautiful island village in the town of Binangonan, Rizal province, in the Philippines. She is a mother to four. Her husband, Teodoro, is 65 and her partner in business.\r\n\r\nBefore, she sold charcoal and made baskets but the business was so tedious and consumed so much time, she opted to shift her business into fishing. For her 11th loan, she proposes to borrow 40,000 pesos to purchase a motorboat for fishing. This will be their new business. \r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that the business will grow and be sustainable since fishing is one of the staple sources of income in the island village and having a motorboat is an edge over other fishermen.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of helping her grandson with his school fees, expanding her business and building a more spacious and durable

They reside in the island village in the town of Binagonan, Rizal, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWith her determination to rise-up from poverty, in 1995 Mercy decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. During her previous loans, she was noted for being wise in spending her loans. Now on her 11th loan, she requests a loan of 40,000 pesos to pay for fishing gear and a fishing boat which she finds to be a helpful and very productive business.\r\n\r\nMercy is positive that her business will grow and can give her enough proceeds to sustain the school fees of her children. She also dreams of having a fish pond (a place to grow fish)

In 2008 she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, and is now requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP to use as additional capital for her retail business of beauty products, clothes, slippers, shoes, underwear, and many other ready-to-wear products.  She dreams of earning a good profit so that she can save for her father's medical needs and to help pay the school fees for her nephews.  Also she will make some repairs to their house.  She hopes that someday her business will grow and expand to offer delivery to nearby places.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":349642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Delfina is 40 years old, a very responsable woman who lives with the father of her 2 children in her own house. Before she used to sew potato and pea, but 2 years ago she also started sewing flowers (gladiolus) which are very profitable during the holidays. Therefore she rented land where she sews in the months of January and July in order to harvest on the key dates, thus being able to sell each packet of 12 dozen for 70 or 80 soles. After these dates the price is 20 soles per packet. During the low seasons she sews potato and pea until the month of October where the price of the flowers raise again. Sometimes the draught delays the flowers but then she waters them at night to facilitate the flowering on her land. Delfina is very happy sewing and selling flowers and in order to transport them safely to the market she wraps them carefully with paper and raffia which she keeps for the occasion. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she has always made the repayments punctually. She also carries out her post as treasurer of her community bank with responsibility and has earned the esteem and respect of her partners. The money will be spent on buying chemical fertilizers for the flowres so she can harvest in the month of October.\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva

She is a thoughtful woman who treats others well.  She is happily married, and she has two adult children.  \r\n\r\nIn her youth she was able to build two houses.  She lives in one with her husband.  She gave the other one to her son so that could live there with his family.  Due to the hard work she did in her youth, she suffers from pains in her feet.  But, that does not discourage her from continuing to work on her farm.  In spite of her limitations, she helps her husband take care of the plants.  She really likes to think about her crops, and she likes working with them.  \r\n\r\nShe gets up at five in the morning to cut wood and prepare food.  Then, at eight in the morning she heads for the field, where her husband is already doing the agricultural work.  She happily joins the work.  During all of these years, agriculture has given them much happiness.  Thanks to agriculture they could build their houses and proviD. comforts for their children.  Therefore, this couple does not think about leaving their crops.  On the contrary, while they have the strength they continue acquiring more land to rent out in their old age.\r\n\r\nEstela has been working with MFP for ten consecutive loans.  During these years she has demonstrated punctuality in her payments.  She is very used to all of the members of her community bank, and she greatly appreciates them like they were family.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she is now asking for to buy ten sacks of chemical fertilizer, which she calculates will cost 1,900 PEN.  With the rest of the money she will pay the workers who clean and prepare her farm for planting.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She became a widow six month ago and currently lives with her three children in her own home. After the death of her husband left her indebted, her main economic activity became planting and selling diverse products, and she had to stay strong and work doubly hard on her crops. The land and her efforts bared fruit, and she was able to pay off all of her debts. Since then she has been much more calm and motivated to keep working for the wellbeing of her children, who are still growing. She hopes the older ones can help with the planting. Haydee enjoys cultivating and caring for her plants, especially her peas, because she can harvest them three times with only one planting and that helps her generate very nice earnings. Her goal for the future is to increase her production to be able to purchase more land to cultivate, which will help her earn more money for her children's education. This is her 10th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she has shown herself to be very responsible and dedicated to her payments. In the various events the community bank organizes, for example sporting functions, Haydee is who lifts the spirits of her companions because she has earned the esteem of all the bank's members.

(on the far left in the picture) is the group coordinator for a group of five women form the Sabana Perdida neighborhood of Santo Domingo. She lives in a small house near the Ozama River with her husband and three children. Two of her children are girls, ages 8 and 5, and the third is a two-year-old boy. Marta's business is a successful fruit stand located on a busy road in Santo Domingo. She sells a wiD. variety of fruit, including watermelon, papaya, mango, green bananas, pineapple, and melons.\r\n\r\n<P>Marta intends to use this loan for working capital to continue increasing both the stock and and variety of the fruit that she sells. Additionally, Marta has ambitions to use the larger profits she will realize from selling more fruit to begin to stock a small fantasia (a variety store, usually with underwear, school supplies, cosmetics, and jewelry) that she will operate from her home.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Where Marta lives, her home is at risk from flooding when the river swells during hurricanes and tropical storms. Also, the house that she lives in has a leaky roof and weak walls. With the money that Marta hopes to gain from her fruit stand and fantasia, she plans to first improve her house with a stronger roof and cement walls. However, in the long run, her goal is to move away from the river to a neighborhood on high ground. She firmly believes that this is the right thing to do for herself and her husband, but, particularly, she wants her children to be able to grow in a stable house so that they will be able to focus on their schooling.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>This is Marta's third loan from Esperanza. She has successfully repaid the first two loans. Marta described how, at first, she was afraid to take out a loan because she was very poor and was worried that she would not be able to pay back the loan. However, after discussing the loan with her husband, and much prayer, she decided that she would take the loan. Thus far, Marta says Esperanza has helped her to expand her business and earn more money, in addition to repaying her loan. Now, she says that she has more confidence in herself and her business abilities. When asked what she had to say to potential Kiva lenders, Marta said \"I hope that they will lend as much money as possible to help people like me, because it has helped people like me to live a better life and give a better life to their children.\"<\/P>     "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":349716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more fruit to sell at her fruit stand and to improve her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.466667 -69.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2009-07-09T03:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohanna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Altagracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yocasta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":52000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4315.08},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4318.39},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4321.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4325.02},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4328.34},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4331.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4334.98},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4338.3},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4341.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4344.96},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4348.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4351.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.4},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.49},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.59},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.68},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.87},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.96},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":122.4,"local_amount":4315.08,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4388.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63168405,"comment":null},{"amount":122.49,"local_amount":4318.39,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4391.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63168406,"comment":null},{"amount":368.05,"local_amount":12975.06,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":13194.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029012,"comment":null},{"amount":122.87,"local_amount":4331.66,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4405.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029013,"comment":null},{"amount":35.51,"local_amount":1252.03,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1273.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96941036,"comment":null},{"amount":159.64,"local_amount":5627.88,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5723.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103782440,"comment":null},{"amount":155.29,"local_amount":5474.75,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110671497,"comment":null},{"amount":388.75,"local_amount":13705.15,"processed_date":"2010-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":13937.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118067739,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T06:52:58Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:18:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":120938,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nilda tiene 31 a\u00f1os, es una mujer de car\u00e1cter pasivo y buen trato, actualmente vive con su pareja y padre de sus 2 hijos en la casa de sus suegros.

Mientras tanto, su esposo se dedica a la siembra de papas y arvejas, en algunas oportunidades ella lo apoya, sobre todo en los d\u00edas de cosecha, es la encargada de la recolecci\u00f3n de las papas. Nilda est\u00e1 muy contenta con las actividades que realiza, por ello anhela incrementar la cantidad de sus animales y comprar terrenos de cultivos para sembrar avena para alimentarlos. Este es su d\u00e9cimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y durante los periodos concluidos demostr\u00f3 pagar puntualmente y ser muy respetuosa de los acuerdos de su banco comunal, donde adem\u00e1s estima mucho a sus compa\u00f1eros. El dinero que viene solicitando lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de materiales para la construcci\u00f3n de otras jaulas para sus animales y de alimentos concentrados para que engorden con rapidez. ","en":"Nilda is 31 years old.  She is a quiet, well-mannered woman. She lives with her partner, the father of her 2 children, in the home of her in-laws.\r\n<p>\r\nSince starting her family, Nilda has been in the business of breeding and selling small animals (guinea pigs and rabbits).  Every Thursday and Sunday she brings 8 to 12 guinea pigs to market in the town of Tarma.   Most of the time, each guinea pig sells for 10 or 12 soles while a rabbit sells for 25 soles.  Her sales come to an end when competing merchants start liquidating and lower their prices to 8 soles per guinea pig and 15 soles per rabbit.  Before returning home, she stops to buy food concentrates to fatten her remaining animals. \r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile, Nilda\u2019s husband is engaged in the planting of potatoes and peas.  She sometimes helps with the planting, but her main responsibility comes at harvest time when she is responsible for gathering the potatoes.  Nilda is very happy with her business, so she is eager to buy more animals and acquire more farmland to grow oats for animal feed. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP. During her previous loan periods, she was punctual with her payments.  She is respected by her communal bank group and gets along well with the other members. The money she is requesting will be used to buy construction materials for animal cages and food concentrates to help her animals gain weight quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":349731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase animal feed and building materials to make cages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-10T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":328.57,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1000.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734004,"comment":null},{"amount":821.43,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2501.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959566,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T22:29:07Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":120939,"name":"Erika Yamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erika Yamileth P.

Boca Chica is known for having soft, white sand; a place where the water is calm, clear and shallow. But what tourists don\u2019t normally see are those who are trying to survive in the nearby communities. Especially now in the down-turning economy, many are left without employment because businesses keep on shutting their doors. \r\n\r\n<P>That is why Maria started her own business four years ago -- to try to secure a steady income. She has her own shop where she sells clothes, intimate wear, kids' school uniforms, school supplies, and decorations for the house. Often, when Maria finds it is time to re-stock, but doesn\u2019t have much money saved up to do so, she borrows money from local lenders. The local lenders charge a 20% interest rate per week! <\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Maria found out about Esperanza through her neighbor and close friend and now she is seeking a loan through Esperanza. Esperanza charges a 2% declining balance interest rate every two weeks; 4% per month. Esperanza also helps its clients with complimentary services, such as a savings account, medical and life insurance, literacy courses, and business management training, just to name a few.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Please strongly consider lending to Maria and her group.

She is a hardworking and good-natured woman.  She lives with her partner, the father of her 5 children, in the house they inherited from his parents. They plant and grow agricultural crops such as potatoes, peas and beans to earn their living.  Alicia wakes up at 5am so that she has enough time to prepare the meals and tend to the younger animals. Afterwards, she begins her work in their fields. \r\n<p>\r\nAlicia says she enjoys working on a farm.  Since she was a girl, she has helped plow the fields, always thinking about which crops to plant.  Thanks to her husband\u2019s influence, she finds herself more motivated.  Once harvesting is done, they sell their products at the Tarma city market.  They select potatoes of the same size so that they can be placed out for sale at a fixed price.  Through her hard work and excellent pricing of her products, Alicia has been able to pay for her children\u2019s education all these years. Her next goal is to buy additional farmland to increase her output. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Alicia\u2019s ninth loan with MFP, and she has responsibly repaid her previous loans. She also has the backing of her fellow communal bank members, with whom she feels very happy. She will use the money to purchase 20 bags of chemical fertilizer, estimated cost of approximately 2200 soles, and with the remainder buy food for family consumption.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":349888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734005,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T08:07:44Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121000,"name":"Esmeralda Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el centro focal Germ\u00e1n Buch, se re\u00fane la asociaci\u00f3n \u201cEsmeralda\u201d, est\u00e1 formado por doce mujeres, demostrando responsabilidad en sus seis a\u00f1os de trabajo junto a Pro-Mujer.

After suffering a terrible accident 20 days ago, Alicia was left with injuries to her body and face, which is why she covers her face with a scarf to block out the sun and stave off worse infections. Before the accident, she worked daily on the fields of her parents and in-laws. Ultimately, she and her husband decided to plant potatoes and peas of their own while they left their daughter in the care of Alicia's mother. Alicia really enjoys working on the land because it's something she has done since she was very little, and now that she is recovering from her ailments at home she is very bored. Since then, her husband has been the only one working on the crops, and she hopes she'll be able to get better soon so she can help with the harvest since that's when the most work is required, but once it passes everything relaxes until the next planting. Her wish for the future is to be able to acquire her own land to cultivate. This is her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and her husband has worked with loans in the past with his communal bank and has shown himself to be punctual with his payments.

Since childhood she has dedicated herself to agricultural and livestock work. The house has a spacious stable where she and her brothers are in charge of the animals' cleaning and feeding. They also make sure they are free of parasitic infections.\r\n\r\nAfter a month of intense work, they sell the animals in the livestock market and also rent out their bulls for ploughing during the planting season. The cattle farm brings them more income than farming the land does, thus Gladys is planning to expand the stable space in the future to be able to house more animals. \r\n\r\nThis is the sixth loan she has had with MFP; she is much loved by the other members of her community bank due to her charisma.

V. is from the village of Mantic, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is 19 years old. Genine is married and has no children. To make a living, Genine owns and operates a transportation business. She provides pedicab transport  to local community members. Genine has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Genine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Genine is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP that she will use to renovate the business. This is Genine's first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and  Misamis  Occidental. Its membership consists mostly of farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

D. is a woman of faith and courage who is trying to cut the string of poverty that hinders the dreams of her family.

The family lives in the island village of Sapang in the town of Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nDigna joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2008. When she got her first loan, she invested it in fishing. The business did well and now she is asking for a second loan, a loan of 10,000 pesos to pay for 10 bundles of fish nets and other equipment for fishing.\r\n\r\nDigna is hopeful that in the near future, her business will grow, and they will have more fishing gear--she even dreams of having her own fishing boat someday. She aspires to send her children to school until they finish schooling and find

Most of her earnings are being used for their daily expenses, thus she is somewhat worried because her three children are already attending school.\r\n\r\nWanting to secure the future of her children, Janeth is being motivated to borrow from Kiva the amount of PHP 5,000 for use as additional capital. With that, she will somehow feel she can relax because she can save money for the education of her children.

V. is from the village of Kinuman Norte, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 30 years old. Maribel is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Maribel owns & operates a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Maribel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maribel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maribel is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Maribel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit  offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He says that even though sometimes he feels tired, he still continues to sell for the future of his two children. Because of this, he wants to borrow PHP4,000 from Kiva lenders to purchase more bread that he can sell every morning.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Yvett, on the other hand, is working as a call center agent in Manila. Though his wife is not staying with them because of her work, he always sees to it that they have communication. Rolando also shares that he and his wife are willing to sacrifice for the benefit of their children.

A. is 44 years old and a mother of two, a boy and a girl. She is married to Eustaquio, a fisherman, and lives on the island village of Malacaban, Bainangonan, Rizal province. Letecia is a woman of faith and determination to rise above poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 1995, Letecia joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, and was noted for her exemplary performance. When she joined ASHI and was able to have access to capital, she invested her loan in the resale of fish. But years later, she opted to set up a fish cage (fishpond) business, which she found more profitable and easier to maintain. Currently, she has fish caging as her primary business and the resale of fish as her secondary business.\r\n<p>\r\nNow on her 11th loan, Letecia is requesting the amount of 45,000 PHP to pay for the materials needed for her fish cage business: 3 cages worth 30,000 PHP, 100 pieces of bamboo worth 5,000 PHP, and 10,000 PHP worth of fingerlings. Letecia is optimistic that her business will grow bigger and will bring enough profit for her family's needs. She is also hopeful that with the proceeds from her business, she can send her youngest daughter to college to finish her desired course.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":350016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fish

The most significant change she realized about herself when she joined ASHI is her more positive attitude towards other people and perception towards circumstances she is having. Because of the opportunity of loaning she had with ASHI, she developed her self-esteem and she was able to manage her own business.\r\n\r\nResiding in a village near the sea, the livelihood of most people is fishing. Dymphna started her buy fish vending business when she first loaned in ASHI while her husband drives a rented motorcycle with sidecar (popularly known as \"tricycle\"),  which is the main means of transportation of people in the whole municipality. Dymphna is striving hard to grow her business in order to save some of her earnings to buy a tricycle for her husband. In this way, they will earn bigger because her husband doesn't need to pay for the rental of the tricycle and this can also be used as her means to sell her fish directly to people in different villages.\r\n\r\nDymphna's was able to achieve her dream partially when she received her previous loan. She bought a motorcycle yet she still needs to buy a sidecar for a tricycle. This is the reason why Dymphna applied for another loan after her previous one was paid. Some of the amount of her loan will also be used in buying fish to sell.\r\n\r\nOnce Dymphna achieved her dream for her business, there will be no doubt that she will also achieve her dreams for her children. Cazandra is on her second year in high school while Cheyz is in his Grade 6 in elementary grade. Soon, Dymphna will be having college students and she hoped that she can sustain her children's education. Her loans from ASHI for her business would be a great help for her in achieving those dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":350011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

P. is a 40-year old married woman. She has five children and unfortunately, the twin babies inside her womb were aborted just recently for reasons she don't know. It was a indeed a heartbreak for Marlene and her husband, Jimmy, because they did not know that the six month fetus inside her womb were twins. Because of poverty and no enough nutritious food taken, she might have not given them proper nurture. However, Marlene had to move on with her life and her dreams for her other five children. She recently applied for a loan in ASHI amounting to PhP 48,000 in order to purchase a motorcycle in installment basis having a downpayment of Php20,000 and sidecar in cash payment of Php30,000 for her tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar attached to it) for her husband to drive. \r\n\r\nTricycle is one of the main means of transportation of people coming in and out of the village all throughout the municipality. Marlene's husband has been driving a tricycle for hire owned by other people for 20 years now. This is Marlene's daily source of income since her farming business which was her primary business since the beginning of her membership in ASHI, can only generate income every four months. With the increasing need of her family finances her husband and their farming business can hardly sustain, they have to increase their income. Having their own tricycle to be driven by her husband, the whole of his daily earnings will go to the family because he doesn't have to pay for the tricycle rental. \r\n\r\nHaving been a very good member of ASHI in the past nine years, showing a very good performance in payment, attendance and business, there would be no doubt that Marlene will be able to do better with her present loan applied. Her dreams of giving her children better education and better life motivates her to move on and make good in her business.

Dinara is this group\u2019s leader. She teaches English in a local school and at the same time holds the position of Vice Principal. She has three children: two sons, both of whom work, and one daughter, who is a school student.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago Dinara started her own business of cattle raising. She bought two calves and now these calves have gained weight and in fall she is going to have them sold or slaughtered for meat. She wants to expand her business and needs a loan to build a new yard for her cattle as the one she has at the moment is in a bad condition. This yard is not suitable for her cattle in wintertime and therefore she is taking precautionary measures now, so that she does not lose her cattle in winter.\r\n\r\nShe says that having a business apart from a regular job helps her be constantly active and motivated. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include Mairamkul, Gulyasyl, Kachkyn and Gulmira.\r\n\r\nMairamkul is a married woman aged 51. She owns a small shop and besides that makes national carpets. She needs a loan to rebuild her yard for her cattle and to increase its area.\r\n\r\nGulyasyl is a housewife. Many years ago her family bought some cattle and since then she has raised it and now she sells her cow\u2019s milk. All of her children have their own families, but she prefers to live independent of her children.\r\n\r\nKachkyn is the mother of four children and works in construction. At the same time she manages to breed cattle for which she has ten-years of experience. She has a pretty decent income and now needs a loan to purchase some more cows.\r\n\r\nGulmira also works at a construction site in the capital. She used to work as a masseuse. Then she bought some calves and started cattle raising. She wants to purchase some more calves to raise them for her son\u2019s wedding and then to resell the rest. \r\n\r\nAs can be seen, all the members of this group combine two or more jobs and that makes them even more passionate about their plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She works in \u201cAl \u2013 suu\u201d, a limited liability corporation. She makes the labels. She needs a loan to purchase a bale of cotton for making traditional seat-carpets. Then with the rest of the money she wants to buy a sheep.

Her husband, Godofredo, is a government employee.\r\n\r\nJuvy has run a variety store in a destitute area of Buntong Palay, San Mateo, Rizal for more than two years.  Her store caters to the basic needs of their community, including rice, purified drinking water, and electronic load distribution (mobile phone credit). Before a recent break-in, her store earned a weekly profit of P5000. The thief who broke into her store ran off with grocery items and  all the money in her cash box. With little inventory, and no money to replace the stolen items, she is only earning around P2,000 a week now. Her new loan will be used to replenish her store and to buy sacks of rice and purified drinking water in five liter containers.

D. is from the village of Water Fall, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 36 years old. Vilma is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Vilma owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both beverage and daily use products in the local community. Vilma has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Vilma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Vilma is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Vilma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family and to pay the tuition fee of the borrower's children.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":349534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A., 62, is a widow with a grown daughter (who is also a businesswoman).\r\n\r\nCelestina owns and manages a togue (mung bean sprouts) and lumpia (spring roll) wrapper making business in Concepcion

Celestina and her four employees (one of whom is shown in the picture with Celestina) deliver their products to nearby markets in Commonwealth, Parang, Tumana, and San Mateo as early as 2 o'clock in the morning. The businesses consumes four bags of mung bean sprouts (totaling 100 kilos) and 50 kilos of flour every day. Celestina earns a daily net income of 1500 to 2000 Philippine pesos (or about $30 to $40 US dollars). The loan she's requesting will be used to buy more mung bean sprouts and flour because her family's present capital is no longer enough to supply her growing business.\r\n\r\nCelestina dreams that

She lives in Azire, Cameroon.  Alice and her entire family live in a house with 4 rooms.  Alice overcomes many challenges in life such as taking care of her children and supporting her husband by paying fees for their children. \r\n\r\nAlice runs a restaurant business frying gateaux (a kind of cake) in front of the family compound with the support of her children. She plans to invest this loan in her business and other farm work. Alice hopes expand this business since she has been operating it for a number of years.\r\n\r\nThis will be Alice's second loan from GHAPE. She has been a member since 2008.  Her business is very successful due to its location and Alice's reasonable prices.  Thanks to the experience she has, she now serves more customers.\r\n \r\nPart of her profits from this loan will be used to take care of her ageing mother, as well as to buy necessities for her family and her grandchildren. The other part of the loan will be used to improve her farm. Alice intends to start repayment immediately on the day of collection.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

As if that was not enough, the cold hands of death took away her first-born due to an accident, a son she had in mind to be very supportive of her.\r\n\r\nBefore her first two loans, F. had only a little to start frying Accra beans (a mixture of ground beans) and used the profits.

Besides that, she and her family have simply suffered the results of poverty and the accompanying challenges of life that has brought them.\r\n\r\nF., however, has the beginnings of a solid business.

She will be able to feed her family, provide them with clothes and will have the opportunity to save for the future as well.\r\n\r\nF. came to GHAPE because of the training scheme the organization offers, because of the terms of the loans, and because the method of repayment is \u201ccomfortable and convenient\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She started the business in 1993. After a very prosperous year, she was hospitalized with typhoid fever and business dropped off. Following the death of her husband in 1994, Jos\u00e9e decided to continue with her micro-business, which helped greatly towards the education of her three children, who are still at school. From 1996-2002 she operated a pharmacy and small store but fell victim to fraud. She closed the pharmacy to expand the store using loans she obtained from Hope via one of the \u201cProsperity Plus\u201d groups. The loan she will receive during the next loan cycle will be used to buy boxes of soap and other items in order to boost the store\u2019s inventory and thus increase her income. Jos\u00e9e is 50 years old and has five children aged between 15 and 31. The eldest is married and the four others live with her.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva
