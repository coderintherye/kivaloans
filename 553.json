This means that, despite being just 19 years old, she has acquired many responsibilities like having to care for her siblings due to her parents\u2019 separation.  Her father is a clothes maker and left her the workshop so that she can work it making all kinds of women\u2019s clothes.  She also does silk screening on polo shirts.  All the merchandise she produces is sent to Chiclayo where her father sells it.  During these months sales are good because the school year is starting and orders for uniforms and sweat shirts increase which is precisely what she will use the loan for: to boy fabric to manufacture sweatshirts.  She is a member of the \u201cTRABAJANDO EN ARMONIA\u201d (Working in Harmony) group where she has the position of Secretary.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to accomplish lots of projects with the business she runs but first she wants to finish her Design and Silk Screening courses to put into practice what she\u2019s learned thus making her business into a large firm.\r\n\r\n*Deysi is the first one in the photo; she\u2019s carrying an orange notebook.

The resort is visited by many tourists, locals and foreigners alike.\r\n\r\nHere we met Se\u00f1ora Norma, aged 65, married and the mother of six children, all grown up. She was born in Montecristo, but due to her husband's health they had to leave for San Jacinto a few years ago.\r\n\r\nTogether with her husband she completes and sells straw hats. They work every day, since producing a straw hat is rather complex. They love what they do because they know that their work is much appreciated by their clients and because they earn a good income. They buy basic or semi-finished hats in Montecristo, complete them and sell them to tourists who come to their store. They also wholesale hats to merchants who ship them to their own customers elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more hats. It is her third loan with the Communal Bank. She is grateful because the loans help her to finance her activity and she learns a lot during the meetings. Her dream is to stay in good health, she and her husband.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":720353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy straw

is a 46-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a food vending business. She lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000.  Jereza is borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase raw materials. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jereza aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

E. is from the village of Langcataon, Pangantucan, Bukidnon. She is 46 years-old. Juanita is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Juanita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as junk food, snacks such as rice cakes, and a variety of beverages including softdrinks and fruit juices in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juanita joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juanita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Juanita is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as junk foods and beverages. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Juanita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":720427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives in Danao City, Cebu. Gregoria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gregoria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to buy medicines and vaccines for her pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future renovation of house. Gregoria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Bago, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: buying and selling Avon products and herbal medicine. Her husband Ernesto who is 66 years old, retired from work and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 35 to 42 years old. Leticia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leticia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, to purchase more products to sell so that she can continue to save up for future daily needs and house repair. Leticia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and basket weaving.  Her husband Roel, who is 37 years old, works as a motorcycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 7 and 11 years old. Marites joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marites has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,400 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy livestock supplies so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and house renovation. Marites is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 38-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating hog raising and livestock businesses. She lives in Danao City, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her hog raising and livestocks businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. Sheila is borrowing PHP 11,000 to purchase livestock supplies.  This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Sheila aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Isaac, who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between 5 and 21 years old. Marjorie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 23 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marjorie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 24th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements. Marjorie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 43-year-old widow who supports her family by operating a candle making business and a general store.  She lives in Danao City, Cebu. Martina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Martina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,600 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for candle-making so that she can continue to save up for future education and expansion of her business. Martina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Cadiz, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband Willy, who is 44 years old, works as a fish vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 15 to 23 years old. One of the children has their own family and two are currently going to school. Mylaluna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 23 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mylaluna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 24th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 for additional capital for her fish vending business so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements & the education of her children. Mylaluna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Cadiz, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari store and an electronic re-loading business. Her husband Armando, who is 47 years old, works as a machine operator to earn his living. They have three children who are between 15 and 24 years old. Ronalyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ronalyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her second  loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house repair. Ronalyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Cadiz, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending\/dried fish business. Her husband Jesenillo, who is 40 years old, works as a vendor of dried fish to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between 6 and 20 years old. Rosalinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to purchase more stock so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements. Rosalinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 66-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a sari-sari (general) store and a fishing business. She lives in Bais City, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store and fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Felina is borrowing PHP 12,000 to purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Felina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

is a married woman who lives in Bais City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store and a buy and sell business.  Her husband Alejandro, who is 47 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have three children who are 26 to 32 years old. All of them have their own families. Gigilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gigilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 30,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 for additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future renovation of their house. Gigilyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Elvies has been able to graduate from college. At 36, he is married to Irene, with whom he has three children. Together they live in Tanza, Cavite. To reach those big dreams, one of the steps Elvies took is to become a community partner of CCT.\r\n\r\nElvies runs a mini grocery, a dream for many small variety store owners. He also sells ready-to-wear clothes and school supplies based on the needs of his community. He has been running this business for five years now and is still counting. He manages to run the mini grocery alone, and monthly he earns an average of Php12,000.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he would like to request a Php45,000 loan. With this amount he plans to buy a jeepney of his own with which he can deliver goods or products from one place to another. This will be of great help to his business, both for the mini grocery and the RTW business. The remainder of the loan money will be used to purchase more grocery items to add to his store.\r\n\r\nElvies constantly prays for a second floor to add to their house, because he wants the home to become better than it is at present. Also, it is his desire for his business to become productive and enable him to prepare a good future for his family. Of course, it is easily said than done, but for a person like Elvies who has the passion and determination to reach for his big dreams, nothing is impossible.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":720600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

is married and has 4 children. His passion has always been woodwork. He learned the skill when he was a young. Since then, he's been experimenting and learning new things. With the experience he has gained in the process, he was been able to start his own small business manufacturing doors and windows about 11 years ago. Ikhtiyor has an individual approach to each client. He always tries to please his customers, even when they have very sophisticated taste. Ikhtiyor doesn't have to face high competition. However, he always aims at high quality and wants to have all his clients pleased with the result of his work. \r\n\r\nIkhtiyor is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase additional raw materials to be able to provide his customers with even better quality and trendy furniture pieces. Ikhtiyor always has had much demand for his products as there are constantly new offices and stores being built. \r\n \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After he married, he continued working in the same business, watching the business grow as a result of his sacrifices, and seeing his family progressing more and more. His hope is to continue growing and improving his business to offer a better future for his children. He would like to see his children become professional, ethical and hardworking. For this reason, Mahmadkul is asking for a loan that will allow him to buy additional livestock. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

T. (12) is a 38-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa.  Thanh is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general services to local community members.  Thanh has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Thanh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000,000 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase equipment to improve the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 7,000,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Thanh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions for her family.\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n1.  Bich P. T.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

owns a rapidly growing business, selling sweets in the small town of Gafurov in Tajikistan. She has been in this business for 15 years and has proven to be a very sharp business owner. Sanat was able to purchase a storage container which helps her keep her inventory fresh. Another way she has been able to save money is to buy inventory directly from the manufacturers rather than from middlemen suppliers. \r\n\r\nSanat has requested a loan of 6000 Somoni to help her purchase additional merchandise. She loves what she is doing and is looking forward to the future. Sanat and her husband are grateful for the opportunity this business has given, not only to provide for them, but also to help their children.  \r\n           \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muhammad is a 53-year-old farmer who lives with his three children and wife. He has two milk cows and sells dairy products to local and capital traders. He is also engaged in a farming business. Muhammad has six years of experience in raising cattle and growing potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers. His milk products are in very high demand in his village. Muhammad\u2019s orders for these products are very high but the milk his cows give is not enough for traders so he has decided to apply for a loan of 5,000 TJS to purchase an additional cow and fertilizer for his land. Muhammad is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his standard of living with this loan. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Ahror has become a very successful businessman. He works very hard and spends all his time with his animals, cleaning and feeding them. Now Ahror wants to expand his business and buy more cattle so he has applied for a loan of $3000 USD.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, as well as epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a business selling deli meats, but she also sells clothing and shoes for both men and women. Her main clientele is made up of housewives, young people and employees and neighbors in the sector and the surrounding areas. Her business has helped her husband provide for the family. The family is made up of 3 children who are going to school and to whom she dreams of supporting them every day, to see them have a career and become successful.\r\n\r\nHer life as a merchants started when she saw the need to obtain and additional source of income to positively impact the household. She asked her father to sell her cheese on credit, in order to start out in the market. And that's how she started. At the start she had 20 pounds of cheese but later she took on 30 pounds because the sales had increased. It occurred to her later on to invest the earnings from this business sin the purchase of merchandise. Given that she had such a large clientele buying cheese she managed to build her own store to sell products such as clothing and shoes. Her idea was a success and the clientele that she had was an important base to start a new business. Currently she has fifty regular clients and search one visits her constantly. She is happy to make her sales and this translated into a positive impact to the merchant community. \r\n\r\nSuhey sells on credit, taking payments every 3 months. She buys in wholesale and obtains discounts of 30% to 40%. During the year she sees an increase in sales in certain months: May, June, September, November, and December. Her dream is to expand her business selling many other products to a large and demanding client base. It is very likely for this to happen because Suhey is a very charismatic woman.  She still has enough time for everything but especially to provide loving care to her children, and to earn a good income from her work. Currently she will invest her Kiva loan in the purchase of deli meats, ladies clothing, and ladies and gentlemen\u2019s shoes.  This investment will reach any potential clients and make them into regular clients. She \r\nHas set her goal and this investment will help her meet their demands. This Kiva loan is her second through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and she has been with the organization for two years. Since she started with this organization she comments that \"her life did a 360 turn because they have helped her establish a credit history and this have helped her pave the way towards success\".

This is a cheerful, party area and it is where Alenys runs her business selling fast food such as 'salchipapas' (a combination of sausage and French fries in sauce), hot dogs, burgers, natural juices and fried products in general.\r\n\r\nIn her community, which is large, and in the surrounding neighborhoods, everybody is familiar with the food from Alenys' business.  Her business came about when she found herself without a formal job.  She took advantage of the situation and re-activated a business that her family hadn't kept going.  She and her boyfriend (who she will marry soon) decided to re-establish the business and keep it running.  She took on this risk without being very sure but her business began to grow and she has managed to stabilize it.  She has even realized that she can make more progress in it.\r\n\r\nThe success factor of this small businesswoman is her persistence in going from less to more.  She has managed to go from selling just a few products to selling many more, adding soft drinks to her line of products.  Alenys prepares natural juices with fresh tropical fruits such as mangos, watermelon, mandarins, bananas, etc.  Her business is always busy with customers seeking a taste delight, good hygiene and good food.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Alenys' first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use it to buy a sauces, fats, vegetables, cold cuts, tropical fruit and sugar in larger quantities.

She also is a franchisee for other businesses like package delivery services and public utility payment services at her store and at two other sales points.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use this Kiva loan to buy stationery items like: notebooks, construction paper, agendas, reams of paper, markers and highlighters to insure a successful investment because this is the season of highest sales for school supplies due to the return of students to classes.\r\n\r\nZandra used prior loans to buy new computers to expand her Internet access service.  Loans have also maD. it possible for her to diversify her stock inventory adapting it to each season.  Her greatest challenge is competition, which is fierce, but she\u2019s managed to face it successfully because her prices are better and she offers a wiD. selection of services to her customers.\r\n

Su hija mayor trabaja con ella especialmente en las ventas y con ellas ha salido adelante con su negocio,  pues ha logrado tener su casa propia y aun todos los d\u00edas se esfuerza por aumentar su bienestar familiar, por eso necesita mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales y justamente ese es su gran desaf\u00edo, porque requiere capital con el que en la actualidad no cuenta, para este prop\u00f3sito.\nEn la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y su primer credikiva, con el comprar\u00e1 insumos al por mayor, como aceites, arroz, y az\u00facar principalmente,  pues  son los que mas aumentan de precio constantemente.

The beach, the breeze, the sun, and happiness are the characteristics of this environment.  This is where she conducts her business of making fried food and chicken, meat, and cheese pies.  She has been working this way for 11 years in order to manage to support her two children.  The children are 16 and 18 years old.  \r\n\r\nShe started her enterprising idea in her house.  She only sold fried foods, but she was gradually moving to neighborhood stores.  She gives them money daily to rent.  Her oldest daughter works with her, especially in sales.  With the sales she has gotten ahead in her business.  She has managed to have her own house.  Even so, she works hard every day to increase the well-being of her family.  To do so she needs to improve her housing conditions.  That is her great challenge because she needs capital that she does not now have for this purpose.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first loan with Kiva.  She will use the loan to buy wholesale supplies like oil, rice, and sugar mostly.  These are the supplies whose prices increase constantly.  She will also buy an industrial stove, a table, and utensils to increase the effectiveness of her investment.  She will do this, above all, so that her business has an image of quality.  This will attract many more customers

She says that past loans have helped her tremendously because she's used the money to build a business that has allowed her--though a single mother--to support her family.  She likes owning her own business because she can work when she wants, in the neighborhood, and be close by to take care of her family.  In addition to her son, Sra.

Their two children attend primary school. One of the projects they hope to accomplish in the short run is to improve the infrastructure of their humble home.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn extra income and help with household expenses, she started her own business selling cell phone credits, soft drinks, sodas, popsicles, and ice cream. She started it with her own money, but is experiencing some difficulty because she needs more of an investment in order to maintain her business. She will use this loan to buy merchandise like: candies, soft drinks, fruit and cereals to make frozen desserts, plastic bags, cell phone credits, and other products.\r\n\r\nAnesbelia is grateful for this financing because it will provide her with an opportunity to grow with her small

L. owns <i>Business Startups, LLC<\/i>, whose mission statement is \"to enhance the skills of entrepreneurs with tools and expertise for success.\"  Business Startups helps entrepreneurs with setting up an accounting system, website design, and business formation (for corporations and LLCs).  As an attorney, Frank has 25 years of legal and accounting experience, and has extensive experience working with for-profit and social entrepreneurs.  \r\n\r\nLocated in El Paso, Frank opened Business Startups this past January, 2011.  His biggest challenge at the moment is marketing.  Frank has an assistant who helps with managing the workload.  Like Frank, his assistant works with clients by helping them prepare for small business ownership.  Aside from Frank and his assistant, Business Startups hires an independent contractor to help clients design their businesses\u2019 web pages. \r\n\r\nFrank is using this loan to help handle the initial cost of his assistant as well as other smaller operating costs.  He says that even though the loan was small, \"it took me over a hump and enabled me to launch my business with a more complete website, an employee and a strong infrastructure.\"  Without this loan, Frank says getting Business Startups on its feet would have been more difficult.\r\n\r\nACCION Texas-Louisiana was Frank\u2019s first choice for taking out a loan, and is the first loan he has taken out for his business.  \"I have known about ACCION for many years.  I believe in its philosophy and the concept of micro loans.  I also know many people at ACCION.  It is a great organization with great people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. L.\u2019s advice to other small business owners is, \"\u2026 dream big, plan carefully, be persistent, work hard and have faith.\"  On his website, he gives free advice and examples of essential things to consider when starting a business.  This helps entrepreneurs understand the preparation needed for starting a business, and how Business Startups can help meet those needs with expert advice and planning.\r\n\r\nCheck out the Business
