This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nNening is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her 3rd from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

T. is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Saanapu 3.  She is married and has 5 children.  To make a living, Sera owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Sera has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 450 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nSera joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Sera has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Sera is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Sera plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":412349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Vaapuu M. is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Leualesi Leauvaa.  She is married and has 5 adult children.  To make a living, Urima owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Urima has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Urima joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Urima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,200 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Urima is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  This will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Urima plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. is a 22-year-old woman living in the town of Faleasiu Tualesolo.  She is single and does not have any children.  To make a living, Ruta is starting a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Ruta has been engaged in this business for over 1 year and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ruta is now requesting a loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Ruta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The family has access to electricity but no piped water.  \r\n\r\nShe owns a stall selling charcoal and bananas. She does her shopping from delivery vans, which get the items from villages. On average, she receives 10 customers a day. She works in the outskirts of Kampala. She has been in this business for six years and with MCDT for 10 years. She is servicing her 17th loan, working with the same group mates. \r\n\r\nHer monthly expenses include school fees and medication. Her challenges include defaulters and the rainy season, because when it rains very few customers come to her stall since it is in muddy place. Nulu wants to use this loan to buy more sacks of charcoal and bunches of bananas. She is aspiring to see her business grow stronger and to start selling only on a wholesale

Having successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 tala, which was used to expand the business, Savali is now requesting a loan of 2000 tala which will be used to renovate the business.

Muava has been in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 550 tala a month.\r\n<p>\r\nMuava joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Having successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 tala, which was used to purchase handicrafts to sell, Muava is now requesting a loan of 2000 tala which will be used to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.

On average she receives 10 customers a day. She has been in this business for seven years and with MCDT for seven years; she is currently on her fourteenth loan, working with the same group mates. Her monthly expenses include school fees and medication. Her challenges include defaulters and the rainy season because when it rains very few customers come to her stall since it is in a muddy place. Saidat wants to use this loan to buy more second hand clothes. She aspires to expand her business and eventually sell only wholesale.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":324.88,"image":{"id":412441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

B.'s oldest son attends a local secondary school and his youngest is in kindergarten. \r\n\r\nB. currently operates a taxi service in his town. He first went into business in 2001 by transporting and delivering coal and firewood using his own truck. However, in 2006 the truck broke down and B. decided to buy a small car to transport people instead. He has found some success with his taxi, however, as many people in his town have started driving taxis in recent years, his profits have been decreasing.

B. is 50 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Bayan-Ulgii province in western Mongolia. He and his family live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His three children, two sons and a daughter, all attend a local secondary school. \r\n\r\nB. operates a livestock selling business in his province. He travels up to 200 km from his town to sell livestock throughout the province. In Mongolia it is common for a household to buy at least one cow and 10 sheep to be eaten during the long Mongolian winters. For that reason, B.'s business is particularly busy during October and November. \r\n\r\nB. started his livestock business in 2004 and has had steady growth over the years. To supplement his income, he also owns three cows that can produce up to 3 liters of milk per day. His wife sells the milk for 1,800 tugurugs (~1 USD) per liter. Selling livestock is hard work and B. works diligently to raise quality animals. He even produces all the hay necessary to feed his animals. He hopes to continue his success and says, \"All I want is to save enough money for my children's education.\" He is requesting a 1,000,000 tugrug loan to purchase more livestock to sell.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":412448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Avelina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Avelina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

They all have children who are currently in school. They are engaged in the trading of foodstuffs, clothing, cosmetics, groceries, and so on, as the source of livelihood for their homes. However, due to inadequate working capital, they make barely enough income to meet the needs of their households. \r\n<p>\r\nTheir common dream is to see their businesses grow, which would enable them to improve the living conditions of their families. They believe this loan will help them to inject more capital into their businesses to materialize this dream. Members of this group agree to guarantee for one another as social collateral and to assist one another in repaying the loan on schedule."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":412802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase used clothes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Mampong","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.066667 -1.4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-10-25T12:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kwame","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kwame","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":3800,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":633.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":633.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":633.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":633.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":633.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":633.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":441.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":441.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":441.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":441.66,"local_amount":633.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":636.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103870719,"comment":null},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":633.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":636.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110760036,"comment":null},{"amount":441.66,"local_amount":633.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":636.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118148740,"comment":null},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":633.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":636.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123986876,"comment":null},{"amount":441.66,"local_amount":633.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":636.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017547,"comment":null},{"amount":441.68,"local_amount":633.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-23T08:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":636.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742383,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T12:42:23Z","paid_date":"2010-05-23T08:00:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147096,"name":"Buya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Buya K. from northern Sierra Leone.

Her companion is a farmer who plants basic grains.  His specialty is growing corn and beans.  Mirna established this business on her own because she was only taking care of children and their economic situation was not very good since her partner was 100 percent responsible for the household expenses.  Now, with her business, their situation has improved a lot and she contributes for food and covers some of the bills when she can.\r\n\r\nMr. Santos Isidro V. buys and sells pigs.

A few days later a buyer comes and he sells the animals.  Mr. Santos lives with his partner and doesn\u2019t have any children.  He only has a brother-in-law who relies on them because he lives with them due to illness.  Mr. Santos is a person who is well known in Sta.

Located in the province of Alajuela, the community lies in a semi-mountainous region where the main economic activities are agriculture and livestock breeding.  It is a community that has great opportunity for development and establishment of micro-enterprises in both agribusiness and commercial trade.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past 10 years, Don Francisco has been dedicated to woodwork but only started his own business approximately one year ago.  He builds furniture in different designs and for different uses.  Since starting his business, he says the results have been good and his work is widely accepted in the community.  The revenues he has generated have helped to support his family.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Don Francisco is requesting a loan of 680,000 colones to buy a sander, an edging machine, wood, and other materials needed for making furniture.  He hopes to continue growing as a micro-entrepreneur so that he can generate more income to improve his living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Francisco is a member of the Community Credit Enterprise of Canalete, one of 100 partner organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.

Her story is representative of the members of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated from Haiti to the DR) clients more generally. Her group is based in Cumyasa an area near the town of La Romana where the economy centers around sugar cane and where both running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. Here she makes her home with her husband and two children.\r\n\r\nLourdes is excited about requesting her second loan with Esperanza. She has successfully completed her first loan cycle. She plans to use this loan to invest in her colmado\/bakery (small corner store) by purchasing five gallon jugs of clean water to sell and platters on which to serve the cakes she bakes. She believes that this will increase her business and the attractiveness of her product, helping her to realize larger profits. With these profits she plans to continue constructing her home and to save for her children to go to university. One of her long term goals is also to move her business to a place where there is more foot traffic and therefore more customers.

In the early morning hours, Virginia carries her merchandise from her modest home to one of the busiest markets in their district.  She works as a travelling merchant and her income enables her to pay for her family\u2019s expenses.  Virginia enjoys her work, which allows her the freedom to establish her own schedule and devote time to her children and her housework.  Sometimes the job can be tiring because she works Monday through Sunday.  Fortunately, sales have been good and Virginia expects her business will continue growing.

","en":"Georgina is a 32 year old housewife.  She lives with her husband, Jos\u00e9 Luis, who is 38 years of age and with her three children:  Mayte, 11; Keiko, 5; and Mat\u00edas, age 3.\r\n<p>\r\nTwo years ago, she had the idea of beginning a profitable business in which she would be her own boss. As a result, she began preparing and selling cakes, which she used to sell to relatives and friends.  After a short time, the business grew and she began to prepare pies and snacks.  She began to receive orders for weddings, promotion celebrations, baptisms, and events organized by neighbors and acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nIt is very satisfying to her to make these delicious desserts since she pours affection and dedication into each one.  Although often she can\u2019t fill the orders that are given to her, this shows that her desserts are quite sought after.  This is why she feels able to get ahead and offer her family a better future.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP, and she has always been very punctual in making all her payments, just like all the members of her group.  With the money she is applying for she will buy greater quantities of ingredients for her desserts. She will acquire these ingredients at wholesale since this is more economical.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":413027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of ingredients for making desserts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-24T01:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Georgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":240.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":263.96},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":276.24},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":298.07},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":302.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":319.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":331.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":348.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":362.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.03},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.7},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.29,"local_amount":240.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":243.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843085,"comment":null},{"amount":173.97,"local_amount":497.07,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":501.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734663,"comment":null},{"amount":8.1,"local_amount":23.14,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":23.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124054,"comment":null},{"amount":96.68,"local_amount":276.24,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959734,"comment":null},{"amount":104.33,"local_amount":298.07,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":300.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992592,"comment":null},{"amount":106.03,"local_amount":302.95,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":305.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717370,"comment":null},{"amount":114.69,"local_amount":327.69,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":330.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751161,"comment":null},{"amount":113.18,"local_amount":323.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":326.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933723,"comment":null},{"amount":121.95,"local_amount":348.43,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":351.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672643,"comment":null},{"amount":126.78,"local_amount":362.23,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":365.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886501,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-24T04:27:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147220,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelly es una alegre mujer D. 57 a\u00f1os D. edad, vive con su hija (Mar\u00eda), D. 14 a\u00f1os, quien es su principal alegr\u00eda; ellas viven en su casa propia.

B. is from the village of Tugas,Baliangao, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of goods to the local community. Catherine has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Catherine joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Catherine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. Catherine is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Catherine from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Danao, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Merlinda is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Merlinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Merlinda is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Merlinda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling barbecued meats in the local community.

Rocelyn is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Rocelyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Anita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Anita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Anita is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Anita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

I. is a 75-year-old woman living in the town of Saoluafata B.  She is married and has 6 adult aged children.  To make a living, Vaiauau owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Vaiauau has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Vaiauau joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Vaiauau has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1700 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to rent land to raise additional crops.  Vaiauau is now requesting a new loan of 2250 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Vaiauau from SPBD.  Vaiauau plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nVaiauau was not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 9\/29\/09.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. is a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Tufulele.

She has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 350 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anarosa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.\r\n\r\nAnarosa is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to pay for services to increase crop yield. The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAnarosa is not affected by tsunami which hit Samoa on 29th September 2009. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Baraka Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Gatundu Baraka borrowing group consists of four men and four women and is located in Gatundu town, outside of Thika. The members are each receiving 20,000 KES from this group loan. They are engaged in a range of businesses, including tailoring, motorcycle driving, clothes boutiques, mali-mali (house product sales), and a restaurant.  \r\n\r\nThe group leader is George Mwangi W. and his business is selling shoes and charcoal. His main challenge is lack of funds for expansion, so he is using this loan to increase his inventory of both shoes and charcoal.
