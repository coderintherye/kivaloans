She plans to repay the loan in three months. \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Russian by Anya Ezhevskaya, Kiva translator <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0440\u0443 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430  \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430  \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043a. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442  33 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0435 . \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0440\u0443  \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435  \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043a. \u0416\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 . \u0421\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0432 \u0438\u0445  \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0410 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e-\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0440\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0443.\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 3 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":164051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Nurek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.388333 69.325","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2008-07-30T12:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulru.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-13T14:15:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-09-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-14T07:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":519,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":325658,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-10-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-14T07:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":519,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":358376,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T05:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":519,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5340026,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-30T14:15:46Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T05:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":50150,"name":"Teo Kato\u2019S Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teo K. is a 40-year-old widow with six children.

Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about \u2018kuku,\u2019 the Swahili word for \u2018chickens.\u2019 Raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons that raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals?

Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku, which is Swahili for 'chickens.'  Raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons that raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":164383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase additional chicks, feed, and antibiotics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-05-26T13:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-10T07:16:35Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263343,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":292256,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322710,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-19T07:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355059,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":47647.04,"processed_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":47830.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347665,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970280,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886530,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435815,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130120,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36026953,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-05-27T07:16:35Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":50268,"name":"Eneta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania!

A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time ask anxiously, \u201cbut how do you make sure people pay the loan back? Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually the \u2018poor\u2019) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people. Whether or not this is true is irrelevant for a number of reasons. Firstly, most microfinance lenders have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive: the incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026The primary incentive is to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":164451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional stocks of beer and soft drinks in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-05-28T11:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dativa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-19T01:17:10Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271835,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301087,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331821,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-24T07:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365900,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347696,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-06-05T01:17:10Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T03:24:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":50304,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

She operates her business with the help of her daughter in the central local market, which allows Fotima to have many clients, the majority of whom make purchases in the market and stop by her business to enjoy her delicacies. On a daily basis, Fotima purchases the latest foodstuffs and she then cooks delicious dishes for her customers. <p>\r\nOver the last 25 years, her business has generated stable income, but this year is especially important for Fotima because one of her sons is getting married while another son is graduating from school and will soon be entering the university. Being a loving mother, Fotima wants to support her sons and, in order to do so, she is planning to expand her business by purchasing additional kitchen wares. If she is able to put her plan into place, she expects to generate more income, which she will spend on the marriage of her oldest son and to pay the fees for the education of her younger son. With this purpose  in mind, she is requesting a loan in the amount of $850 to be repaid within 12 months. Fotima is counting on your help, and not only thanks all for supporting her but also promises to repay the loan

K. is a 28-year-old married man. He has two kids, both of whom are young at present, but he works extremely hard in order to ensure the best future for them. His wife takes care of their house and watches over their kids. <p>\r\nFor a living, Akram works as a farmer, and he has done so for six years. His business is stable and is the main source of income for his family. Specifically, Akram grows onions and maize. During the growing season, Akram works in the field from early in the morning until late at night.

She and her sons work from early in the morning (typically starting at 6:00 a.m.) until late in the evening (until 6:00 p.m or so). Each year Adolat grows a sufficient amount of crops for family consumption and to sell for a profit. Indeed, her business has been the main source of stable income for the family for the past five years because her husband is retired and is on a pension. <p>\r\nAdolat is planning to cover the higher education expenses of her youngest son because he is finishing school and will soon be entering university.

Vazira begins her workday early each morning at 5:00 a.m. In practice, she buys fruits and vegetables from the local farmers, and she then sells such produce in the market, where she is well-known by customers for her friendliness and because she sells her fruits and vegetables for affordable prices. As a result, Vazira\u2019s business generates a stable yet considerable income for her family. <p>\r\nNow is the prime season in which to sell fruits and vegetables, and her goods are (not surprisingly) in high demand. For this reason, she is seeking to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables in order to re-stock her store and to thereby expand her business. Accordingly, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,500 Somoni ($450), which she will repay in 8 months. In turn, she hopes to generate additional income in order to pay for her children\u2019s university fees and, with your help, this will be possible. Vazira would like to thank everyone for supporting her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":165854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To expand her business in order to pay for her children's university fees by purchasing additional fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-06-17T15:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vazira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-02T15:53:02Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271892,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301150,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331894,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365979,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":53.25,"local_amount":177.5,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":184.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943226,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":194.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220324,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":194.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20409275,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":194.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27102328,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-06-18T15:53:02Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T19:28:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":50426,"name":"Kahramon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kahramon R. is 64 years old.

He buys dried coffee beans from farmers and takes them to the coffee factory for removal of the husks. Customers are usually at the factory ready to buy. He uses the husks for manure on his farm but he can also sell off the excess. James also buys fresh coffee beans from farmers and dries them at home, thereby lowering his costs. He also books orders from those coffee plantations that are yet to be ready by paying a deposit to the owners. This business has allowed him to support his family and to buy pigs and chickens for his wife to keep at home for their farm. \r\n<p>James is a good client of Pearl Microfinancing in the Kyosiga Women\u2019s group, making his repayments promptly. Now he needs a loan to buy more coffee seeds.

She tries to be optimistic even in the most frustrating situations. Not long ago someone stole her wallet with all her monthly profit. However, Larisa handled that challenge really well.

The group is currently in the fifth stage of their program for women.  The union of this committee is largely thanks to the efforts of Gloria C. who sought out each of these women in their homes and invited them to come to partake in an information session in their home.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how the Koe'ju Committee was born, in our second aboriginal language Guarani the name means \"Sunrise\". This committee is composed of 15 women of which 7 sell yucca breads (a traditional food in Paraguay widely popular and resembling cheese bread).  Three of the women run grocery stores and the others sell clothing. They are all neighbours in the Kennedy region in the city of Caaupe.  One of the virtues of this committee is the interest and loyalty in the rules and regulations of the program, and in the timeliness of the monthly payments. These women also hold a capital savings thanks to the work they carry out every weekend in the markets, for special events, sporting events, and any other occassion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the members receive an equal sum of money and they will invest it in the purchase of ingredients and merchandise for their sales. The committee's objective for the short term is to improve the image of the region by keeping the public patios clean and by painting the fences along the streets and also to remodel the small plaza, in need of repair and repainting.  In addition, the play structures need to be repaired so that the children might have their recreational area to play in safely.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras que en su mayor\u00eda son comerciantes, la mayor\u00eda de ellas se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de chipas, actualmente el grupo ya est\u00e1 en su 5to. ciclo del programa comit\u00e9 de mujeres.

Her husband is a local fisherman who does well for himself fishing in the province's many lakes and rivers. He earns US$5 a day. Tuy S. and her husband have eight children, the oldest of whom got married just recently. Two others are also grown up and currently work at a hotel earning US$120 per month.

They are married, and each wants to make a contribution to the family budget, but up to now Ghufron K. alone has been shouldering all the expenses. With a large family and only one person working, it is difficult to support the family. He looked to several banks for loans, but he felt the best about Microinvest's good conditions. Once he received a loan, he began renting another minibus to drive and loaned his own minibus to his eldest son.

She is 45 years, single, with 5 children between the ages of 3 and 20 years. Three of them are still in school. The community she resides in and works in is semi-urban, within a slum and a wetland. The area is prone to flooding in the rainy season. \r\n<p>She has been selling second-hand clothes for the last 15 years, which she purchases in bales to sell at wholesale and retail. She has a stall where she displays the clothes. Sometimes she looks for clothes to purchase in the weekly markets that occur on different days.

Lola has a small stall in the local Tursun-zade city market, where she sells retail goods that she bought wholesale. Her business provides the primary source of income for the family. In total she has more than 17 years of experience in business. She would like to expand the variety of goods at her stall by adding new items. That requires monetary resources, so she decided to take out a loan, to be paid back over 12 months.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

She buys young bull calves at the market, raises them for 45 days, and then sells them at the market for a profit. This provides supplementary income for her large family. Her husband works, but has a very small salary which is not enough to support the family. Burigul wants to buy three bull calves and feed, but she does not have the financial resources to do so.
