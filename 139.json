She bought them from a market in Phnom Penh to sell along the local roads in front of her house. Her business revenue has helped send her eldest daughter to study at the University. She hopes that she will be able to send her other two children to study at the University as well. Currently, her business is running very well because many customers come to her shop very day.\r\n\r\nTherefore, she is requesting a loan of $500 to purchase more vegetables, meat, tables, and chairs for expanding her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":212994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

W. is 58 years, married and has 5 grown up children. He stays in Ruai town, on the outskirts of Nairobi. Bernard also takes care of his father aged 90 years; who needs constant special care since he is bed ridden and has to have somebody by his side always. Bernard makes sure that the helper he has employed is always by his fathers' side so that he can feed and bathe him.\r\n\r\nBernard story is of sheer determination. In the year 1967, Bernard was employed in a hotel in Sagana a town in Central Kenya where he was paid Ksh 20 per month and he used to save Ksh 10 per month. His employer raised his salary to Ksh 100 per month. True to his determination he saved enough money and by the year 1988 and with an initial capital of Ksh 30,000.\r\nBernard with other businessmen from Central province relocated to Nairobi the capital city. Here they selling clothes which they usually got after sending one of them to neighboring Tanzania, this continued until 1989 when they decided to part ways, and everybody started operating individually.\r\nDuring this year conflict of trade between the two countries made Bernard to opt to operate from Kenya by starting to sell second hand clothes from one of the biggest second hand markets in Kenya named Gikomba Market. This he did by acquiring a \r\nStall, he started with 3 bales of clothes. Business is usually good since many people like the second hand clothes since they are cheap, some going for as less than a dollar per piece.\r\n\r\nBernard also combines his cloth selling business with the sale of fruits, and since these are seasonal he reaps profits from the sale of them.\r\n Bernard suffered a set- back in his business last year December when Kenya experienced the post election violence, all his stock of clothes were stolen and the rest was burnt by the youths. Bernard was so distressed and to be hospitalized for three weeks after which he got counseling, he ahs been selling pine- apples at his former stall and he still hopes he will open his stall again. During this period, Bernard was directed to come to the Action Now Offices so that they can see how to help him after he came to our offices. We foundries case worth sanding to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n Bernard is kindly requesting Ksh 40,000 from Kiva lenders. This will enable him; purchase 5 bales of second hand clothes.

She looked for various alternatives to earn money and this was the best way to accommodate her needs, because she can also care for her children while she works. This is a better life, and Juana enjoys sales. First Juana began washing and ironing clothing and cleaning the houses of her neighbors, plus a couple of other activities that combined, earned enough income to support her children. In April 2002 Juana began to sell used clothing when her son, who lives in the U.S., sent her boxes of used clothing. She sold them, and was able to support her other children and help her grandchildren. Thanks to a previous loan with Kiva, Juana could buy more boxes of clothing. Now she'd like to buy used clothing for autumn and winter. \r\n\r\nJuana needs a loan of US $400, which she'll repay in 5 months.

Situated on the right bank of the Mantaro River, at an altituD. of between 2600 and 3600, the community has a mild climate and can be accessed from the towns of Huancavelica and Huancayo by both rail and road. Farming (cereal crops, potatoes, beans, vegetables); animal husbandry (sheep, cattle, and young animals); as well as commerce and tourism are the main activities. \r\nTeresa A. is married and has eight children. She began her business 8 years ago with a small amount of capital, but because of health problems, she lost everything. She began selling meals and opened a small store that she still runs. With the loan that she receives, she plans to increase her stock. Now she not only sells from her store but also from a stall that she has in a school. Her dream is to see her children become professionals, especially her four youngest children as the older ones are married and she does not have the means to have them study.\r\nPaulina S. is married and has five children. She started work with FINCA six months ago when she invested her first loan in the purchase of guinea pigs and chickens. Beforehand she could not sell anything because no one would lend her money, whereas now she buys and sells young animals. She has succeeded in increasing her income and now has no problems putting bread on the table. Her dream is to save enough to buy a plot of land so she can live there with her mother-in-law.\r\nSaturnina F. is married and has four children. In the past she used to wash clothes for a living, but now she sells anticuchos (type of kebab) and fried foods.

Sophy T., 47 years old, is a grocery seller who lives in Preytahou Commune, Kampong Thom Province. She sells many kinds of products including cake, candy, soft drinks, and food ingredients in front of one school in her village and earns around US$1.66 per day. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Mr. Ly Kong, is construction worker, earning around US$2.00 per day. Sophy has four children, some of whom are students and stay at home to help generate family's income. Two of her children are garment workers who earn US$4 per day. \r\n\r\nSophy and her husband work hard everyday in order to support family daily expenses.

She is divorced and she lives alone.  She does not have any children.  For the past 9 years she has worked making ice creams in her own business, but she has 20 years of experience, as she began working in an ice cream factory.  Since Estefan\u00eda decided to become independent, in order to sell ice creams, it has gone very well, and she currently gets good profits and sells all that she has.  Usually she sells during the mornings, which is when people eat most of the ice cream, and also in part of the afternoons.  She likes to work because it allows her to interact with people, making friends with adults and children, who eat most of her delicious ice creams.  The difficult part of her business to have to fight the climate.  Often, in her area it is cloudy in the mornings, or it is raining or hailing, which lowers demand. Estefan\u00eda wants to have a secure old age.  She has worked since she was a child, and now since she doesn\u2019t have children of her own to care for her she worries about her future.  With the money that she is asking for she would buy better ingredients in order to improve her ice creams and styrofoam boxes, which is what she puts them in to sell them, so that in the future her business will be more productive and profitable.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":213678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients to make and sell ice cream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-16T06:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estefania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T10:38:12Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336153,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957398,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227648,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-17T07:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422883,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116107,"comment":null},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":179.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-16T10:38:12Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69596,"name":"Josue","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Josue tiene 25 a\u00f1os, vive alquilado en un peque\u00f1o cuarto en la ciudad de Juliaca, ya que no tiene familia y vive solo.

He is married and has 6 children -- their ages range from 1 to 18 years old. 4 of them are in school. Besides his family he also supports his mother by sending her food every month. Raimundo went to school up until only the 5th grade because his father passed away and his mother's income as a farm laborer was not enough to pay for education expenses. Due to the turmoil created by the Frelimo\/Renamo war, he had to leave his hometown and move to Maputo with his parents. When the conflict ended they returned to Chibuto but he decided to stay. Raimundo works as a farmer since 1996; he starts his shift at the \"machambas\" (smallholdings) at 5:30am and ends them at 6:00pm. Everyday he has to face the struggle of not having access to public transportation to go back home (10 kilometers away) after his shift is over. This will be Raimundo's second loan request. The first one was in the amount of 10000,00mt and it was used to purchase agricultural supplies. He paid it off before the loan's term date because production was satisfactory. With this loan he intends to purchase more supplies to further expand his land's productive area. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva
