Recently the prices for flour have been rising and Bahodur wants to buy a large batch of flour so that he can keep his food prices low despite the rising flour costs.

All of the women belonging to this bank have a least two businesses. <p>\r\nThey invest the money borrowed in different economic ventures like breeding bulls and pigs and selling chicken, vegetables, baked goods and other foods.  The also sell firewood, cosmetics and heliconia leaves (used to make tamales).<p>\r\nIt was impressive to see the entire group of women so decided about how they would be using the money that they were borrowing.  Norma M. commented that she was going to use a part of her loan to sell cosmetics while the other part would be invested in fruit to sell in the market.  Juana S. said that as soon as she received her loan, she was going to purchase 300 kg of chicken to sell in the market.  Mar\u00eda P., like the large majority of the group, was going to buy 150 bunches of heliconia leaves to then sell to distributors.  While the women sell one bunch of leaves for seven quetzals, a distributor can sell in the cities for double the price.  Mar\u00eda P. was going to invest her money in her tortilla business and in the purchase of firewood.<p>\r\nWhen asked why they like to work with Friendship Bridge, the women said that it was primarily because it gives them a chance to save money.  The inability to save is one of the reasons people can\u2019t get out of poverty.  Additionally, they said that the low interest and the timeframe the institution offered for repaying the loans help them with their businesses.  Also, working under the bank\u2019s methodology is something they like very much.<p>\r\nThe women believe that within the Barrio El Calvario Communal Bank they are all equal.  Not only that, but there is a lot of communication and understanding within the communal bank.  It seems that working with Friendship Bridge has changed their lives.  They are very grateful to the institution and to those who invest in them through Kiva because people have believed in them.  They are sure that they will not let us down.  That\u2019s why helping this and many other groups of women is important, because one gives them a chance and a ray of hope.<p><b>Translated form Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Dentro de este banco comunal uno puede encontrar mujeres corajudas y con una visi\u00f3n empresarial muy caracter\u00edstica de las empresarias de la costa de Guatemala. Todas las clientas dentro de este banco tienen dos negocios como m\u00ednimo.\r\n\r\n<P>Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en distintas actividades econ\u00f3micas, tales como la crianza de toros y cerdos, venta de pollo, venta de comidas, venta de verduras, venta de le\u00f1a, venta ambulante de cosm\u00e9ticos, panader\u00eda y la venta de hojas de mashan (las cuales son usadas para envolver los tamales).\r\n\r\n<P>Fue impresionante ver a todo un grupo de mujeres tan decididas en que utilizar el pr\u00e9stamos que se les iba a otorgar. Norma M., coment\u00f3 que ella iba a usar parte de su pr\u00e9stamo para la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos que los iba a vender de manera ambulante, mientras que la otra parte la iba a invertir en la compra de fruta para venderla en el mercado. Juana S., dijo que a penas recib\u00eda su pr\u00e9stamo lo iba a invertir en la compra de tres quintales de pollos destazados para su venta en el mercado. Mar\u00eda P., como la gran mayor\u00eda del grupo, iba a comprar 150 racimos de hojas de mashan para luego venderlo a los intermediaros. Ellas venden un racimo a siete quetzales, mientras que un intermediario puede llegar a venderlo en las ciudades por el doble del precio. Mar\u00eda P., va a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en su tortilleria y en la compra de le\u00f1a. \r\n\r\n<P>Cuando se les pregunto porque les gusta trabajar con Friendship Bridge ellas comentaron que era primordialmente porque les daba un espacio para ahorrar. La falta de capacidad de ahorrar es uno de los motivos por los cuales las personas no pueden salir de la pobreza. Adicionalmente, dijeron que los bajos intereses y el plazo que les ofrec\u00eda la instituci\u00f3n las ayudaba con su negocio. Tambi\u00e9n, trabajar bajo metodolog\u00eda  de bancos comunales les gusta mucho. \r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras opinan que dentro del banco comunal Barrio el Calvario todas son iguales. No solo eso, sino que hay mucha comunicaci\u00f3n y comprensi\u00f3n dentro del banco comunal. Al parecer trabajar con Friendship Bridge les ha cambiado la vida. Ellas agradecen mucho a la instituci\u00f3n y a las personas que invierten en ellas desde Kiva por que confiaron en ellas y est\u00e1n seguras de no nos van a defraudar.

They told me that the information about women\u2019s preventive health and the use of herbal medicines provided by the Bacilia credit agency was very helpful.

Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The women that belong to the Bienaventuradas group have two characteristics that make one believe that they will do well with the loan that you\u2019re going to give them: assuredness and confidence in themselves and in their respective businesses which they stress to be so important. <p>\r\nThe disbursal took place in the garage of an old house.  An old pickup truck, on which the children were swinging, was parked inside.  The women were seated on typical plastic benches that they had just brought from the church.  All of the women are faithful followers of the churches within Santo Tom\u00e1s la Uni\u00f3n.<p>\r\nIn this group the majority of the women invest their loans in breeding animals and in the resale of both typical and American clothing.  You can also find some that invest the money in cases of thread to make beautiful, embroidered blouses that are typical in the region.  Others have convenience stores where they sell the products in high demand by the townspeople.  With their loan they buy beans, rice and soap along with various other products.<p>\r\nThe women think that working under the communal bank\u2019s methodology is very positive because, even though they live in the same community, they don\u2019t know each other that well.  Because of Friendship Bridge, they know many more women that live close by, but not only do they know them, they work together and cooperate with each other.  This creates an interpersonal bond that\u2019s very strong among the group members.  They also believe that due to the training and interaction, many women lose their shyness when speaking in public and their self esteem is raised.  By believing in these women, through Kiva, you are aiding in their development.  Keep doing it!<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres que pertenecen al grupo Bienaventuradas 2 tienen caracter\u00edsticas que a uno lo hacen confiar que a ellas les va a ir bien con el pr\u00e9stamo que se les va a otorgar. La seguridad y confianza en ellas mismas y sus respectivos negocios que ellas irradian es importante. \r\n\r\n<P>El desembolso se llevo acabo en el garaje de una casa antigua. Un pick-up viejo, en el cual los ni\u00f1os se estaban columpiando,  estaba estacionado dentro de \u00e9l. Las mujeres estaban sentadas en los t\u00edpicos banquitos de pl\u00e1stico que los acababan de traer de la iglesia. Todas ellas son fieles seguidoras de las iglesias dentro de Santo Tom\u00e1s la Uni\u00f3n. \r\n\r\n<P>En este grupo la mayor\u00eda de mujeres invierten su pr\u00e9stamo en la crianza de animales y reventa de ropa t\u00edpica y americana. Tambi\u00e9n se puede encontrar clientas que inviertan su pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de cajas de hilo para elaborar bellos bordados en las blusas t\u00edpicas. Otras tienen tiendas de conveniencia donde ellas venden los productos que son altamente demandados por las personas de la aldea. Con su pr\u00e9stamo ellas comprar fr\u00e9joles, arroz, jab\u00f3n, entre otros varios productos. \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientas piensan que trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales es muy positivo ya que las mujeres, a pesar de que viven dentro de la misma comunidad, no se conocen bien. Consecuentemente, a trav\u00e9s de Friendship Bridge ellas conocen a muchas m\u00e1s mujeres que viven cerca de ellas, y no solo las conocen sino es que trabajan y cooperan seguido. Esto crea un lazo interpersonal muy fuerte entre las integrantes del grupo. Adem\u00e1s ellas creen que por medio de las capacitaciones y la convivencia muchas mujeres pierden la timidez de hablar en p\u00fablico y su auto estima incrementa. Al apostar por estas mujeres, por medio de Kiva, t\u00fa estas ayudando al desarrollo de estas mujeres.

Nevertheless, the town of Los Guineales is blessed with fertile land.  This is a place covered with coffee plantations and when the coffee berries appear, the town is painted red. <p>\r\nThis group of women is known to be very organized and, despite the fact that they appear serious at first, they are full of smiles once they get to know you.  The members of this group invest the money they borrow in two principal activities: woven items and convenience stores.<p>\r\nThe women that work in the textile area use their loans to buy thread, which is used to weave traditional Guatemalan clothing utilizing a special technique.  They also use the thread to embroider beautiful and colorful flowers on the blouses that are worn in the high plains of Guatemala. <p>\r\nThe women who have convenience stores use the money they borrow to replenish inventory.  They all buy laundry detergent, beans, rice, sugar, cooking oil and other products used in the home.  But some of the women with a more entrepreneurial vision also buy products that can\u2019t be found in other stores, like prepaid cards for cellular phones, cereals, deli items and even shrimp.<p>\r\nThe Guineales women say that they like working with Friendship Bridge because of the convenience to pay back the loan in payments due every 42 days with no interest plus, the training they have received helps them grow their businesses.  They also mention that they like working together because they all pay on time and feel like they have formed a solid group. <p>\r\nThis is a special group of women to which Friendship Bridge has given the opportunity to grow.

Sin embargo, la aldea los Guineales est\u00e1 bendita con una tierra muy productiva.

Las integrantes de este grupo invierten su cr\u00e9dito en dos actividades mayormente: tejidos y tiendas de conveniencia. \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientas que trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para comprar hilo. Con este hilo ellas tejen los trajes tradicionales de Guatemala, utilizando la t\u00e9cnica de telar de cintura. Tambi\u00e9n, usan el hilo para bordar bellas y coloridas flores en las blusas que se utilizan en el altiplano de Guatemala. \r\n\r\n<P>En lo que respecta a la actividad de tiendas de conveniencia. Las clientas utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para completar el inventario de sus respectivas tiendas. Todas ellas compran jab\u00f3n para lavar ropa, frijoles, arroz, az\u00facar, aceite, entre otros productos que se utilizan en el hogar. Sin embargo, algunas clientas con visi\u00f3n empresarial compran productos que no se encuentran en otras tiendas, como tarjetas de celular prepago, cereales, embutidos y hasta camarones. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres Guineales dicen que les gusta trabajar con Friendship Bridge porque tienen la facilidad de pagar en cuotas de cuarenta y dos d\u00edas cada una, les acomoda el inter\u00e9s y las capacitaciones que han recibido las ayuda a que su negocio crezca. Ellas tambi\u00e9n mencionaron que, les gusta trabajar juntas porque todas pagan puntualmente y sienten que se ha formado un grupo consolidado. \r\n\r\n<P>Este es un grupo especial de mujeres al cual Friendship Bridge les ha dado una oportunidad de crecer.

Not surprisingly, when they experience a drought, their rice production declines dramatically, thereby making it extremely difficult to maintain a decent standard of living. Moreover, in December 2007, Mrs. Lin Snguong\u2018s husband got tetanus, and he was sent to the local hospital. Presently, Mr. Yorn Yeim is ill again, which makes the family's budget even tighter than it was before he was sick. Facing poor living conditions and a lack of money, Mrs. Lim S. is seeking a loan to buy cows to plow the rice field to exploit the profitable rainy season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":149535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

J. lives in Rudaki district.  She is 53.  She has a large family: a husband and four children.  Tojinisso works as an elementary school teacher in Rudaki district.  At home she also has a small livestock business raising animals.  She has been doing this for about 20 years.  This winter, the nation's poor economic conditions also rubbed off on Tojinisso's business and several of her sheep died.  Tojinisso would like to rebuild her business.  To do this, she needs a loan of 450 US dollars to buy more sheep.  She can repay her loan within eight months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430

is 47 years old and originally from the capital city Maputo. She is a widow as her husband passed away after more than 15 years of marriage. She has 6 children and 3 grandchildren, but only the 3 youngest children (ranging from 14 to 8 years old) and the 3 grandchildren live with her. They all attend school, apart from the youngest grandchild who is only 3 years old.<p>Albertina moved with her family to Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland, when she was little. She went to school until third grade, but stopped due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation. She got pregnant with her first son at 17 years old and has been living with her future husband ever since, taking care of the house and the children.<p>Soon after Albertina\u2019s husband passed away in 2001, Albertina started to sell clothes in Namaacha. She has a stand at the local open market that is open twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays). During the other days of the week, Albertina sells from her house. The most sold items are sheets; each is sold for Mozambique Metical (MZN)15 or 30, depending on the quality and design. Albertina goes to Maputo to buy merchandise once a month, paying around MZN60 in transportation costs. At the market, Albertina makes between MZN300 and 1,500 per day, really depending on the season and weather conditions.<p>Albertina first heard of Hluvuku through a friend who was a client. This will be Albertina\u2019s second loan. The first loan was used to buy inventory and helped increase sales. Albertina was extremely happy with the loan, as it helped her buy basic needs for her children and also increase her monthly profits. This time Albertina intends to use the loan to buy winter clothes, as winter will soon start and she thinks she will be able to sell a lot.<p>In the future, Albertina would like to ask for a new loan to help her finish building a shop in front of her house, where she would be able to sell not only clothes, but also food and basic needs products. The picture shows Albertina with the sheets at her

She has a small grocery shop in front of her house where she sells mainly food and basic needs products. She sells some soft drinks, but refuses to sell alcohol. Her daily income is very related to her inventory. When she has a lot of products to offer she can make up to Mozambique Metical (MZN) 700 in a day.

One of the friends, who is an Hluvuku client, told her about the institution and she is very happy about it. This loan will be used to buy inventory and increase sales.<p>In the future, Lurdes would like to improve her grocery shop and eventually open a new shop at the local market, where she would be able

He has been married since 1979 and had 11 children, but unfortunately just 8 are still alive. Today he supports 7 children and 2 grandchildren; most of them are still attending school, but the oldest is already working to help with his siblings\u2019 school fees.<p>Francisco finished primary school in Inhambane and in 1972 moved to Maputo to work for a mining company. In 1992, he moved to Namaacha to work as a construction worker and never left the village again. Francisco currently works at Namaacha\u2019s open market. He owns 3 stands. He is currently renting two because he has no money to buy inventory and at the third he sells shoes. Francisco buys the shoes at the border country Swaziland for Mozambique Metical (MZN) 250 per pair, and sells for MZN275 or 300 (depending on the design). On top of that, Francisco also sews clients\u2019 clothes, making some additional money. As the market is only open on Wednesdays and Saturdays, Francisco is barely able to cover household expenses.<p>Francisco is also a pastor at the Isione Church. He celebrates mass every Sunday at 10:30 am, but misses the time that he was able to have mass every night. According to Francisco, after civil war started no one attended church at night again, not even when the war was over.<p>This will be Francisco\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku.

She finished primary school in Maputo and didn\u2019t attend secondary school because she got married.<p>Celina comes from a wealthier family than her husband; her father is a good carpenter in Maputo and always gave comfort to his family. Celina faced a lot of prejudice from her family when she decided to get married to a man who had no financial conditions at all, but she knew he was the right one. They have been married for 13 years now and today Celina\u2019s family loves him. They have 3 children: a 10-year-old girl, a 7-year-old boy and a 4-year-old boy. The 2 oldest attend primary school and the youngest go to kindergarten.<p>Celina and her husband moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro, a village bordering South Africa very famous for tourism, for 2 years, but moved back to Maputo when she found a better job. In 2001 her husband found a job in a hotel in Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland, so she moved there as well and started to work at the same hotel in the laundry department. In 2005 her husband was fired and moved back to Ponta D\u2019Ouro to work at a hotel there, but Celina decided to stay in Namaacha as her work was doing very well. She earns a minimum wage salary per month, in 2001 it was Mozambique Metical (MZN)850 and today it is MZN1,600. She works either between 6:00 am to 2:00 pm, or between 2:00 pm to 10:00 pm, and she has a cousin who stays home with the kids. The cousin is 19 years old and attends secondary school in the morning as well. On top of that income, Celina\u2019s husband sends her MZN3,000 monthly, helping with the household expenses and with their project of building a house.<p>This will be Celina\u2019s first loan. She heard about Hluvuku through a friend who is a client and decided to ask for a loan to buy more construction material and speed up the construction. With this loan, Celina will be able to finish the 2 rooms (including roofing), will move there and stop paying the current MZN500 per month in rent. It will still be necessary to finish the living room and kitchen, but Celina is extremely positive that she will be able to do it in 2 more loans.<p>In the future, Celina would like to build a small grocery shop or a bakery near her house to have a business to leave for her children. She dreams of giving her children the same luxury she had when she was a kid, and with her strength she will definitely succeed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":149603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy

Biasanya barang diambil langsung dari langganannya yang sudah menyiapkan barang-barang bekas dan rongsokan yang sudah tidak terpakai lagi dan biasanya sudah dibayar terlebih dahulu. Setelah mendapatkan barang bekas, Fajar kemudian mengantarnya kerumah dimana istrinya Nanik sudah siap untuk menyortir dan memilah barang-barang bekas itu sesuai dengan jenisnya, dan setelah itu siap untuk dijual.
