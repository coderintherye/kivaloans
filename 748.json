He is married to Lurdes, who is a housewife.  They live together in their own home, along with their children aged 15, 8 and 1.  Luis is a farmer, and he has a 15 hectare plot of land  that he took ownership of when he arrived in this area 15 years ago from his hometown of Huanuco.  He is currently cultivating 4 hectares of yucca crops, some of which he sells in the markets in the capital and the other part in the markets of the city of Pucallpa.  To grow and harvest the crops, he depends of the labor of 6 workers, each one of whom he pays 20 Peruvian soles daily.  He enjoys his work in the countryside, and it also generates income to pay for his household as well as the education of his children.  On the negative side, what he doesn't like about the work is when the crops are destroyed by pests, causing him economic losses.  However, he has plans to expand his business and plant even more citrus, and venture into a new area by cultivating palm oil, a product for which there is increasing demand.  This will be loan number 8 with the MFP institution, and he appreciates the opportunity that he is being provided by having this financial support to reach for his goals.  With the sum of 2,000 Peruvian soles that he requests, he will invest in expanding his yucca cultivations to cover more hectares, and he will hire 3 more laborers to do this work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":959114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire 3 workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-25T20:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T02:14:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375078,"name":"Tweyombeke Rwentahi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is 35 years old and is a member of the above mentioned group.

She is both father and mother of her children who are 20, 17, 14 and 11 years old and who she loves vey much. They live in her own home. Loyda works primarily in the cultivation of cassava since this region is conducive to this crop. She has a 20 hectare plot of land that she bought with her former partner 13 years ago.\r\n\r\nCurrently she has a production of 5 hectares of cassava planted and she is selling her crop in the markets of the capital city and in other cities having sufficient acceptance and demand. But she would not finish her work rapidly without the help of 2 laborers that she hires, paying a wage of 20 soles a day. She likes her farming life since from from the time of being a young child she has lived in this environment and she is accustomed and comfortable in it. \r\n\r\nShe says she choose this field because she did not have the opportunity to finish her studies, and seeing the good results she has she plans on continuing and maintaining it. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 2nd loan with MFP and she feels happy with the financial help that she has received to move forward with her work. Also, she feels happy with the communal bank because she knows almost everyone and has good relationships with them. With the money she is asking for she will use 1000 soles to invest cultivating her land in order to prepare for the planting of more hectares of cassava and do this she would contract laborers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":959158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-25T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loyda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T04:04:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375096,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":253.49,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fruits and vegetables for resale.

She started out selling items for the home (dishes, pots,  glasses, plates and containers) to her friends and neighbors in the community, but as the years went by her children grew and their expenses increased and she had to find a way to increase her income.  So, as she was a very good cook, she decided to start selling Mexican snacks and fast food from her home, and at times she also delivers them to people's homes.

She is applying for the loan to buy meats, chickens, condiments, baked goods, and other supplies she needs to prepare the food that she sells. She is thankful for the opportunity that the Foundation and Kiva are giving her.

Pradomar is 20 minutes away from the city of Barranquilla. Here she makes her living by making women\u2019s clothing, a skill she learned as a family tradition since her father is also a tailor. Her mother also is in this line of work and works along with Lidia. Lidia\u2019s studio primarily makes women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing. They have a very concentrated market, made up primarily of mothers with children. For Lidia, the end of this year and the beginning of the next represent a time of great income, but her work also increases as does her need for working capital. This is the reason she has requested a Kiva loan, the first financing she has done through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the loan to purchase raw materials and supplies and also invest in a new sewing machine, which will facilitate effectiveness in her production.

She owns a business selling varied merchandise and also offers telephone and Internet services. She is located in a commercial part of the neighborhood where she lives, and whose qualities make it a great place in regards to potential customers because it is surrounded by homes where people live, there are banks, shopping centers, schools and recreational areas and open spaces and sports fields used also for carnival participants at different times and special events of the city.\r\n\r\nHer idea of a business began when she began her studies and a friend loaned her some cell phone minutes from his plan with which she procured income and was able to pay for her transport fares to go to the educational center where she studied.\r\n\r\nThere she was getting experience little by little and later she added the business of equipment, another venture Maira has. She did some work with her schoolmates on a machine her sister had and they were paid for this. As she gained more experience she bought her own equipment and with a friend she opened a business in another town on the Atlantic, which lasted three years. At the same time she worked in a business on shifts, but she could not continue in this work and quit. Two years later, because of her continuous employment in her work and in the two years until today and having included a variety of goods and toys, she also sells at the toy marketplace, helped by her mother and her sister.\r\n\r\nMaira has been feeling satisfied with this business and her desire to grow as a entrepreneur is immense and this is why she has put herself under the wing of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to have working capital through her first Kiva loan which she would use to buy and to sell toys for the pleasure of seeing the very happy children at the time in which presents of the baby Jesus are given. This is the reason for her loan and with it she will succeed, not only because of her experience, but also because her investment is based on items that her customers have been asking for and who she wants to satisfy to keep them always faithful.

Ubicado alrededor de una hora y media al sur de Lima, Mala, con sus playas de arena, ruinas pre-incas, y la producci\u00f3n del adorado licor nacional, el Pisco (una especie de aguardiente de uva), ha sido durante mucho tiempo un destino tur\u00edstico para los peruanos adinerados. Mala es una ciudad c\u00e1lida y tranquila con una gran poblaci\u00f3n afro-peruana, los restos de un camino ind\u00edgena, y las influencias del imperio espa\u00f1ol. La ciudad, junto con otros cerca de la costa del Pac\u00edfico, fue da\u00f1ado durante los terremotos sucedidos los a\u00f1os 2001 y 2007 en Per\u00fa, pero ha soportado el embate de la naturaleza como lo ha hecho durante gran parte de su historia.  Como bien se sabe el Per\u00fa se caracteriza por tener las comidas m\u00e1s deliciosas del mundo y uno de los platos que m\u00e1s le agrada a  Iveth es  la milanesa. \n\nIveth estudi\u00f3 hasta quinto a\u00f1o de secundaria pero le hubiera gustado mucho estudiar  Dise\u00f1o Grafico.

Known for its sandy beaches, Pre-Incan ruins, and production of the beloved national liquor, Pisco (a type of grape brandy), Mila has long been a tourist destination for wealthy Peruvians.  Mila is a warm and quiet city that has a large Afro-Peruvian population.  The remains of an indigenous trail are located here and the influence of the Spanish empire is evident. The city, along with others near the Pacific coast, was damaged during the earthquakes in 2001 and 2007 but bore nature\u2019s beatings as it has for much of its history.  As is well known, Per\u00fa is characterized by the most delicious meals in the world and one of Iveth\u2019s favorite dishes is milanesa (a typical meat dish dipped in egg and bread crumbs).\r\n\r\nIveth studied until the fifth year in high school but would very much like to study Graphic Design.  Iveth is a single mother and has a little boy who is only one year old.  She is very tenacious and works about ten hours a day selling fruit.   When she was a little girl, Iveth helped her mother sell fruit and learned what it means to earn bread from the sweat of the brow.  This experience encouraged her to have her own business and she has well learned how to manage it in the same way.  On any given day, she may have as many as 70 customers and this allows her to earn approximately S\/. 400 daily.   On a good day she may earn S\/. 650, which helps her with some of the extra household expenses, especially the expenses for her one year old baby.  She believes that the success of her business is due to the variety and quality of the products she offers.\r\n\r\nToday, she is very grateful for the Kiva loans because thanks to the support offered, she has been able to buy scaffolding and materials for her business.  This improvement will help her to increase her business and obtain better income in order to improve the quality of life for her family. In addition, she will be able to have a sales stand in her home in a few months where she will offer fruits and later sell wholesale soft drinks.   She will use the loan to continue investing in her business and it will help her in the future to fulfill her great dream: to have a wholesale soft drink business.  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":155.78,"image":{"id":963066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase scaffolding and materials.

Encouraged, he wants t make his business grow and this is why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his second financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that he will use to buy beef and pork at wholesale to sell it on credit and for cash.\r\n\r\nHe has knives and scales in his infrastructure and everything this business needs for basic functioning.  He expects that his Kiva loan will be a successful investment because he works based on prior orders during a season with much commercial activity which is the end of the year when Christmas and New Years happen.\r\n\r\nHis goal for later on is to include other products akin to meat like fresh vegetables and fruit.  Zeus is satisfied with the way his business has been growing and recognizes that the opportunity to be affiliated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has meant an opportunity for investment for his future family, for current profits and that it contributes permanently to his growth as a person and as a micro businessman.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":963105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beef and pork at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":38749},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45875},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46946},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48041},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49162},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50309},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51483},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52685},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53914},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62836}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":529375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T05:20:04Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375507,"name":"Libardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Con su anterior credikiva, libardo compr\u00f3 su c\u00e1mara fotografica bien buena y gan\u00f3 muchos mas clientes, Hoy est\u00e1 planeando agregar un equipo mas,es decir una c\u00e1mara nueva,  para que su estudio responda rapidamente a sus clientes.

She decided to start the business because she saw that she could make a good income from it and she knew that that it would allow her to better provide for her daughter.  \r\n\r\nJuana is very grateful for the support that she's received from Kiva lenders because she can now build a washroom for her business and make the space more comfortable for her customers.  She will use the rest of the loan to buy merchandise that she will resell.  She wants to sell snacks in addition to the beer and soft drinks that she sells now.  Adding more products to sell will help her meet her goal of \"having a shop so that I no longer have to wait on customers at all hours of the night\". \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":103.85,"image":{"id":963136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for the construction of a washroom for her business and to stock the business with merchandise that she will resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":137.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":139.77},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":149.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":157.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":161.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":168.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":173.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":180.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":187.39},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":193.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.54},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.44,"local_amount":137.16,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":138.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142540,"comment":null},{"amount":52.41,"local_amount":139.77,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":141.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271129,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T18:57:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375512,"name":"Yanet","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yanet naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Cusco y tiene 30 a\u00f1os edad, ella tiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene dos hijos y todos viven en el distrito de San Jer\u00f3nimo.\n\nYanet se dedica a la crianza de animales menores como por ejemplo cuyes y gallinas, ella tiene una peque\u00f1a granja en su domicilio.

Mala, with its sandy beaches, pre-Incan ruins, and the production of Per\u00fa's nationally-adored liquor, Pisco (a type of hard liquor made from grapes), has been a tourist destination for wealthy Peruvians for a long time.  But the authentic city of Ca\u00f1ete is warm and peaceful with a large Afro-Peruvian population, the remains of an indigenous pathway, and the influences of the Spanish empire.  The city, along with others along the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007 as a result of earhquakes which occurred in those years, but has continued on as it has always done through its history.  In his free time he enjoys himself; it is well-known that Per\u00fa is recognized for having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Carlos likes a lot is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" a traditional Peruvian dish with meat and vegetables.  Carlos studied up to his third year in high school but he would have liked to study to be a mechanic.  Carlos is single and works as a glazier in his shop.  He is so proud of his shop that he works there 12 hours every day.  \n\nIn one day Carlos is able to assist 2 or 3 customers, though it depends on the the requests that are made.  This allows him to earn an average of approximately 100 soles (or about 37 dollars) every day and on a good day he can earn up to 200 soles (about 74 dollars).  This helps Carlos to be able to pay for some additional costs, and he thinks that his business is going well because he is punctual when he delivers the requested work that is asked of him and because of the quality and the attention he pays to customers.  \n\nCarlos is very grateful for the help granted him by those who loan through Kiva, because with this support he will be able to purchase more merchandise for his business.  This improvement will help him to increase his inventory and continue caring for customers and as a result it will allow him in a few months to be able to enlarge his place of business and have more variety of products.  This will generate a higher return for Carlos and will help him to achieve his big dream: to buy a truck.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":156.87,"image":{"id":963240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase merchandise (pieces of glass).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-02T17:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Yubani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":208.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":209.41},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":223.28},{"due_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":225.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":236.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":242.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":253.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":260.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":269.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":280.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":289.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":301.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.35,"local_amount":208.92,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":210.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142544,"comment":null},{"amount":78.52,"local_amount":209.41,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":211.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271133,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T13:21:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375528,"name":"Ku\u00f1a Kyrey Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Comit\u00e9 se formo a trav\u00e9s de una de las miembros del grupo, quien se hab\u00eda acercado hasta la Oficina de la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya para interiorizarse m\u00e1s al respecto del  Programa Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras, la misma invito a sus amigas y compa\u00f1eras del Barrio y decidieron sumarse al trabajo grupal para salir adelante y as\u00ed mejorar su estilo de vida, son 23  mujeres trabajadoras y humildes que deben ganarse el sustento todos los d\u00edas.\nDoria es una de las integrantes, ella es una mujer muy trabajadora y luchadora, ella comenta que se dedica mucho para que por medio de ese esfuerzo y trabajo pueda sacar adelante a su familia.

Ica is located in the Sechura desert approximately four hours south of Lima, the country's capitol, and it is hailed by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" which means \"The Land of the Sun.\"  It is known in Per\u00fa for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.7 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives, and perhaps most of all, for being the source of the traditional drink of Per\u00fa, Pisco.  In this warm and arid climate, you find Ivonne's house and business.  She is the mother of a 9 year old, who is in fourth grade in school; her favorite dish is chicken and rice, which is characterized by a dressing consisting of spices like cilantro in which the chicken is cooked, giving it a nice flavor.  \r\n\r\nIvonne enjoys her free time reading and listening to music.  Due to the fact that she did not have enough economic resources, she was only able to finish high school though she would have loved to be a kindergarten teacher.  Ivonne currently makes a living growing cotton on her lot of land, and her husband works on his motorcycle taxi, with which he transports passengers through the neighborhood where they live.  He works approximately four hours a day and with this work he helps a lot with the household costs.  He can earn about 70 soles (or about 26 dollars) per day, and on a good day he can earn about 90 soles (about 33 dollars), and with these extra earnings he can help with additional household costs.  Since there is not much agricultural production at present nor much earning for that work, Ivonne believes that her husband is well-received and that there is a great necessity for people to get from here to there.  The person who encouraged her husband to get into this work was his father, who motivated him to purchase a motorcycle taxi.  \r\n\r\nIvonne is grateful to those who loan through Kiva because with this support being given, they will be able to provide general maintenance for her husband's motorcycle and have more customers.  This will improve the earnings for the household, providing a better quality of life for her family and allowing them to purchase another motorcycle taxi which will make it possible to achieve their dream within several months: to have a cotton exportation business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":90.09,"image":{"id":963273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to maintain her husband's motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T22:10:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivonne Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":116.23},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":124.02},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":135.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":133.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":141.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":143.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":151.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":154.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":160.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":172.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":180.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":184.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":191.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":201.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":206.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":214.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":221.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.59,"local_amount":116.23,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":117.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142545,"comment":null},{"amount":46.5,"local_amount":124.02,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":125.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271134,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T19:36:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375530,"name":"Divino Jes\u00fas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Divino Jes\u00fas, est\u00e1 constituido por 23 se\u00f1oras dedicadas a todo tipo de actividades.

She has two children between the ages of 15 and 17 whom she loves much too much.  They are now in the fifth year of secondary school, and Rosy is very proud of them.  Her husband, a miner, lives with her.  He supports her a lot, and he is her right hand in everything.\r\n\r\nRosy lives in Caman\u00e1, an oasis on the other side of the long and dry Sechura desert, which dominates the coast in the southeastern part of Peru. Caman\u00e1 has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru. Nevertheless, the frequent and strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the past decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and an 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroying the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1 and costing many of the residents their jobs.\r\n\r\nThe result of unemployment is that it creates an atmosphere that is ready for microfinance.  Its beaches, which are beautiful, are Caman\u00e1\u2019s most striking feature.  As it is well-known, Per\u00fa is known for having the most delicious food in the world.  One of the dishes that Rosy likes a lot is \u201cPescado Frito\u201d (fried fish).\r\n\r\nRosy only went to school until the fourth year of secondary school because her parents did not have adequate finances.  However, she would have liked to study cosmetology.\r\n\r\nRosy sells groceries.  She devotes about ten hours a day to her business, waiting on an average of approximately 40 people.  In one day she is able to earn up to 50 soles.  However on a very good day she is able to earn 60 soles.  This helps her with the additional household expenses.  She believes that her business is going well for her thanks to her friendly treatment of the customers and because she offers good quality products.\r\n\r\nShe is currently more than pleased with the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the support they have given her she will be able to buy more products to offer in her business.  Because it is the Christmas season she will buy Christmas products to offer her customers.  She will have a much greater variety, and this will improve her business.  That will give her more income and improve her quality of life.  Also, with these earnings she will be able to save more money in order to fulfill her biggest dream:  Improving her house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":103.11,"image":{"id":963307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy merchandise (groceries and Christmas products).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T21:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosy Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":135.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":139.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":149.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":157.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":161.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":169.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":173.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":180.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":193.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":201.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.63,"local_amount":135.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":136.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142546,"comment":null},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":139.94,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":141.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-12T03:33:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375533,"name":"Las Marias Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Las Marias nace gracias a la ayuda de otro comit\u00e9 que trabajaba en la zona.

Bolot grew up in an ordinary and large farm family, and has helped his father keep up the farm since he was a child. His mother worked at a yarn and fabric factory in a nearby village. After graduating from school, Bolot went to driving school, where he studied for six months. After finishing his studies, he got a job at a local collective farm as a truck driver. In 1979, Bolot got married at the age of 17. At first Bolot and his wife lived with his parents. In 1982, after serving in the army for two years, Bolot returned to his hometown and to his family, and once again began to work at the local collective farm. That same year Bolot's first son was born, and a second son was born in 1984. That same year Bolot's wife got a job at a local store, and they used the money to buy livestock. Shortly thereafter, the collective farm allocated Bolot a parcel of land in his hometown, and, after having sold some of their livestock, Bolot built a small house with some outbuildings. Then Bolot and his family moved there from his parents' place. Bolot continued to work at the collective farm, and his wife got a job as a cashier at a local agricultural office.\r\n\r\nBolot's family grew, and so did their needs. A driver's salary was not enough, and Bolot got a job as a carpenter at a alcohol manufacturing plant. After working there for five years, he got laid off. In 2008, Bolot's oldest daughter was to be married, and Bolot had to sell some of his livestock to marry off his daughter and put together a dowry for her.\r\n\r\nRight now, thanks to his persistence and industriousness, Bolot has 3 milking cows and 18 sheep on his farm. In order to increase his livestock headcount, Bolot has gone to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase more livestock. Bolot's short-term plans include building a large barn and increasing his livestock headcount.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":963574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sarybulak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-28T13:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bolot","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":762.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T19:12:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375584,"name":"Tursunoy","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0439 32 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430.
