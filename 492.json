The family own a small rabbit farm where they raise rabbits for sale. Muna came to FATEN and asked for a loan in order to purchase more rabbits and feed to answer the increased demand, as Al Adha feast is coming soon.\n\nMuna, her husband and one of her sons work on the farm, while the rest are school students. Muna and her husband aim to increase returns and enlarge the farm, especially because they are a big family and Gaza has a lot of farms, which increases competition.\n\nMuna's husband appears on the farm in the picture here since the conservative background Muna comes from prevents her from having her picture online.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

M., aged 26, runs a retail shop in Bissil market where she sells maize, sugar, beans and cooking oil\/fat. Her customers are Bissil livestock traders and people from the neighboring area. She is married to Enoch Nzau and together they have two children aged seven and four. She was introduced to KADET by the credit officer.\r\n\r\nPeninah has been running this business for two years and makes a monthly profit of Kshs 24,500.

She is planning to invest her new loan in the purchase of a display case to put her sweet pastries in.  She will also buy rice, oil, flour, vegetables, etc. for her small grocery store.  She plans to use her profits to buy a freezer and to save.  Her dream is to be able to see her children graduate from university and to be able to live in a comfortable house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":637314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a display case and food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-11-11T01:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wendy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":34000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2572},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2620.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2668.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2718.74},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2769.49},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2821.18},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2873.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2927.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2982.14},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3094.51},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.28},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.18},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.65},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":141.25,"local_amount":5192.01,"processed_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5240.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534100,"comment":null},{"amount":72.61,"local_amount":2668.91,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2693.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534101,"comment":null},{"amount":73.97,"local_amount":2718.74,"processed_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2744.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534102,"comment":null},{"amount":75.35,"local_amount":2769.49,"processed_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:58:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2795.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670867,"comment":null},{"amount":76.75,"local_amount":2821.18,"processed_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2847.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670868,"comment":null},{"amount":158.72,"local_amount":5833.94,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5888.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414209,"comment":null},{"amount":181.91,"local_amount":6686.55,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6748.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991089,"comment":null},{"amount":144.44,"local_amount":5309.18,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5358.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275161,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-11T20:58:40Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":246640,"name":"Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMERCAMUEBLE\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco  y departamento de Cusco.\n\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She is very organized in her personal and professional life, where she sells stationery supplies, clothing, cosmetics, jewelry, gift packs, as well as other items such as footwear and clothing on credit. Ever since she was young she saw entrepreneurship as a way to earn personal income because she has always been very independent, and for this reason she started with small store where she showed off a few items. Gradually the business kept adding more infrastructure and products like the ones mentioned above. Her system of identifying which products to sell is as follows: Madenis has a notebook where she notes everything her customers purchase every day and also records what she does not have but her customers request. In this way she has been able to increase her sales as well as the number of customers and obtain better profits. Madenis sells on credit and has about 25 hand-picked customers whose accounts rotate every 30 days, although she also takes cash. She reports a profit of 35 percent and capital of $2,280, with credit capacity at 94 percent. Her dream is to see her business grow and organize a big local business, but her biggest goal is to have her own home. It's for this reason she and her husband work hard every day to achieve this objective. Madenis belongs to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and this is her third loan through Kiva. With the others she has been able to grow her business and increase its cash flow, and she promises to continue her good investments. With this loan she plans to purchase perfume, footwear and clothing to fulfill customers' order for the upcoming holidays because she wants to increase her sales volume by 25

One night in 1988, while living in Mexico City, her 6-month-old son stopped breathing.  Years later in the U.S., Gabriela was working as a childcare provider and enrolled in a CPR course. While helping the instructor to translate the class into Spanish, she realized that with CPR knowledge she might have been able to save her son. \r\n \r\nOver the next few years, Gabriela worked hard to become certified as a CPR instructor and an EMT and began volunteering with the Red Cross to teach in her community.  Most importantly, she taught bilingual classes to make sure her students really understood the information. \r\n \r\nOne year ago, Gabriela officially founded ACC Safety Education. The business is based out of an office and classroom in Redwood City, California, but she and her children, who are both EMTs, also travel to neighboring cities to teach classes. \r\n \r\nGabriela is proud of what she has accomplished and credits her success to the role models in her community. \u201cIn this country, we are blessed to have the example of other women who are successful and strong. We don\u2019t have to listen to traditions that tell us \u2018we can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I don\u2019t care about those traditions anymore. The most people can tell me is \u2018no.\u2019 And then I\u2019ll go and knock on the next door.\u201d  \r\n \r\nGabriela received business coaching from a community partner, who then referred her to Opportunity Fund. A $2,600 loan will help her buy supplies, fix her computer and go to an American Medical Association conference. This small loan will also build her credit and allow her to take out a larger loan in the future to make more extensive business improvements.    \r\n \r\nLooking forward, Gabriela says, \u201cI am concentrating on my business \u2013 it\u2019s my passion. I\u2019d like to have more classes, more clients, and hire more teachers.\u201d \r\n \r\nTo find out more about ACC Safety Education, visit:

He wants to have his own car and to eventually have his own fleet of cars that he can manage and thus earn more. This is the first loan he has obtained through field partner MFP. He is happy to know that he can count on their financial support and it makes him glad to be part of his community bank because all of its members are responsible and supportive. He thanks all the people that will fund this loan as it will be very useful in his business' progress. He will invest the loan he is requesting in purchasing spare parts for his car's maintenance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":637591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase spare parts for the maintenance of his car.

In this way she can earn a little more income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":637596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2010-11-11T22:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva Nohemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rut Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aura Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geronima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Violeta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188634832,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-26T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5011.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191377871,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195795801,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201237827,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2505.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206104251,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-15T20:43:40Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:18:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":246749,"name":"Las Mariposas De La Posta Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El siguiente  grupo se llama  \u201cLas mariposas de la posta\u201d, se le dio este nombre porque todas viven en el barrio llamado la posta, y mariposas porque al igual que las mariposas soportan todas las adversidades, ellas han pasado por diferentes vivencias dif\u00edciles en el transcurso de sus vidas, ellas dicen \u201clas mariposas son libres y nosotras tambi\u00e9n, emprenden su vuelo y tienen que soportar adversidades y nosotras tambi\u00e9n\u201d, de alguna manera ellas se identifican con las mariposas, que tambi\u00e9n sobreabundan en esta regi\u00f3n de Pinotepa.

They gave themselves this name because they all live in the 'la Posta' neighborhood and, like butterflies, they endure all adversities.    They have lived through a number of different difficult experiences in the course of their lives.  They say \u201cButterflies are free and so are we.  They take flight and have to face adversity and so do we\u201d.  To some degree they identify with butterflies which there are a lot of in this region of Pinotepa.  There are 12 members in this group who are mostly women.  Their representative is called Marisela L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we will talk about Mrs Ver\u00f3nica L. Hern\u00e1ndez.  She is 27 years old, married and her husband, Antonio, is 38 years old.  He has been a carpenter his whole life and has a small carpentry workshop where he makes tables, chairs, beds, etc.  Ver\u00f3nica is the mother of 3 children; Viviana who is 10 and an elementary school student (she is in her 5th year of school), Leonardo who is 5 years old and in kindergarten and Jaqueline who is just 18 months old.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica has a small grocery store which she set up two years ago.  In this store she sells basic household products such as beans, oil, rice, soup pasta, soap for washing clothes, toilet paper and cookies, as well as soft drinks, juice and sweets.  In honor of herself she decided to give the store the name \u201cVero\u201d.  Currently she does not have her own home and the place where she is living is rented.  This is where she has her store.\r\n\r\nVero, which is how all her neighbors know her, requested this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to invest in her business.  She bought products such as beans, oil, soup pasta, rice, canned chilis, toilet paper and laundry detergent.  She also acquired a chiller cabinet for her soft drinks.  She tells us that her main reason for continuing with her business is her children.  She started this business for them.  Sometimes it is difficult to continue but this is not a reason to stop selling.  On the contrary, this encourages her to push her project further and further forward since it is the only real source of income for her family and stopping her work would be very bad in this period of need and lack of work.  Vero's great wish is to some day have a house of her own which would provide her children with assets which would support them.  She would also like to have her own business premises where she could continue with her work, increase the number of products she sells as much as possible in order to grow her sales, and offer her customers a more complete service.  She also aspires to set up a carpentry workshop together with her husband so that they can give work to people who need it so that those around them can improve their quality of life too.  She wants her children to finish their schooling and get good jobs, have a comfortable life and for them never to experience a lack of daily food.\r\n\r\nThe majority of this group's members are enterprising women who fight day by day to get ahead and have a better life.  They face the challenges of an unequal society in which poverty devours the dreams of many.  They are very committed to their trades.  They are all responsible people who fulfil their obligations.  They always show that between them there exists the necessary trust and a spirit of mutual help.  They are supportive of each other in everything and they have very good habits.\r\n\r\nIn the name of all the women who make up this group, Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad would like to thank you.  They would also like to thank everybody who collaborates in projects which improve lives and help nurture the dreams of those who have the least.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members of the \u201cLas Mariposas de la Posta\u201d group and their business activities are as follows:\r\n\r\nDivina G.

Her husband works in an auto mechanic's workshop.  She attended beauty school some years ago, and learned about personal grooming and hairstyling.  She worked in a beauty parlor downtown.  \r\n\r\nAfter working there for many years, she decided to open up a beauty salon and now has been operating for close to 8 years, during which she has experienced some difficult times but has been able to carry on.  She works Monday through Saturday from 8am to 9pm.  One of her daughters helps her mostly with cleaning and straightening up the salon, and she also sells personal care and grooming products.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy hair dyes and other needed personal grooming materials.  In addition, she will purchase some tools for her husband.  This is her first cycle at the Communal Bank and she really likes it because it is easy to get credit.

Ba\u00f1os . \nPor  esta ocasi\u00f3n hagamos un \u00e9nfasis para hablar de una miembro de este grupo ella es la se\u00f1ora Blanca Imelda G. Mart\u00ednez, tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, hasta hace poco mas de 8 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 unir su vida con don pedro de 44 a\u00f1os de edad y con quien actualmente tiene un ni\u00f1o de 4 a\u00f1os y que esta iniciando su educaci\u00f3n preescolar (kinder),su hijo es un motivo muy importante de luchar y de salir adelante con sus proyectos ya que es hijo \u00fanico  y su principal fuente de felicidad dentro de su matrimonio,. Blanca termino de estudiar la preparatoria, pero gran parte de su vida la dedico en ayudar a sus padres y su familia, hasta que conoci\u00f3 a pedro a los 32 a\u00f1os.\nBlanca y su esposo tienen un puesto ambulante de ropa, en el cual venden playeras, pantalones, ropa para bebe, ropa interior de dama y caballero, faldas, blusas, calcetines, short, y camisas, hace  8 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 iniciar este negocio, ella y esposo se encargan del puesto de ropa y trabajan con mucho entusiasmo, ya que aman su trabajo y es su principal fuente de ingreso. Para llegar a su lugar de trabajo, Blanca tiene que levantarse muy temprano ya que su punto de trabajo esta fuera de su domicilio y todo los d\u00edas tiene que llevar a su hijo a la escuela, mientras que su esposo se encarga del negocio, ella actualmente no tiene casa propia, y tampoco un lugar fijo donde pueda comercializar sus productos, y es por eso que se trasladan de u lugar a otro. \n Blanca se integro a su grupo por la necesidad de un cr\u00e9dito, mismo que utilizo para la adquisici\u00f3n de mas mercanc\u00eda para su negocio, con este cr\u00e9dito ella har\u00e1 la compra de; pantalones de mezclilla, de vestir, variedad de camisas, diferentes modelos de playeras, as\u00ed como diferentes tallas y modelos de blusas para dama, tambi\u00e9n para la compra de calcetines, ropa interior. Nos hace menciona  que en ocasiones le es dif\u00edcil y cansado el trasladarse a otros lugares fuera de su domicilio para vender sus productos, ya que esto implica llevar o tener que dejar en ocasiones a su ni\u00f1o, pero la necesidad la obliga, pero como ya lo mencionamos el amor hacia su hijo la anima y la esperanza de verlo bien le dan aliento para seguir adelante, algunas veces se ve obligada a regalar ropa a gente muy pobre y que no puede acceder a la compra de lo mas necesario, ella vende al precio justo y no lucra con la necesidad de la gente y principalmente con los ni\u00f1os. \nEl mas grande sue\u00f1o de Blanca  es  tener alg\u00fan d\u00eda su casa propia en la cual pueda su hijos  tener un patrimonio que lo respalde y de igual forma tener su local propio donde ella pueda continuar con su trabajo para ya no mas tener que ambular de un lugar a otro, quiere incrementar el mayor numero posible de productos, para hacer crecer sus ventas y ofrecerle un servicio mas completo a sus clientes, tambi\u00e9n aspira a que su esposo junto con ella puedan ofrecerle trabajo a las personas que lo necesitan, tener otra sucursal y que su hijo alg\u00fan d\u00eda pueda terminar una carrera profesional, para que no tenga que pasar lo que actualmente  est\u00e1n viviendo.\nLa mayor\u00eda de de las personas que integran este grupo son mujeres emprendedoras que d\u00eda con d\u00eda luchan para salir adelante y tener una mejor vida, se enfrentan a los estragos de una realidad dif\u00edcil, en donde actualmente muchas veces los sue\u00f1os no se llegan a realizar, sobre todo cuando nadie extiende la mano para ayudar al pr\u00f3jimo, son gente muy responsable y que cumplen sus compromisos, lo demuestran siempre, entre ellas existe la confianza necesaria y ese esp\u00edritu de ayuda mutua, son solidarias en todo y tienen el optimismo necesario para salir adelante.\nA nombre  de todos los que conforman este grupo les agradece a todos los que conforman el equipo fundaci\u00f3n realidad y a los que con su ayuda econ\u00f3mica hacen posible la esperanza para los que menos tienen. \nLos nombres de los que integran el grupo \u201cLuna\u201d y sus actividades productivas son: \nElvira Ofelia R.

The members chose this name because it was night time when they came together to form their group.  What is more, that particular night was a full moon.  A further symbolic meaning for them is that there are times when in difficult situations in life, everything seems dark but inside everything there is a light and this is the light of the moon.  At present everything seems to be dark but the light of hope is given to them by the generosity of good people who light the paths of other.  Another of the qualities of identification with the moon is that the majority of the group's members are women and their femininity is attributed to the moon.  Their representative is called Adriana Kukene A. Ba\u00f1os.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we focus on talking to a member of the group called Mrs Blanca Imelda G. M..  She is 40 years old.  A little more than 8 years ago she decided to unite her life with that of Don Pedro who is 44 years old and with whom she has a 4 year old child who is starting his preschool education (kindergarten).  Her son is a very important reason to fight and get ahead with her projects since he is an only child and her main source of happiness within her marriage.  Blanca completed her senior high school studies but a large part of her life has been dedicated to helping her parents and her family, until she met Pedro at the age of 32.\r\n\r\nBlanca and her husband have a mobile clothes stall where they sell t-shirts, pants, baby clothes, women's and men's underwear, skirts, blouses, socks, shorts and shirts.  They started their business 8 years ago.  Blanca and her husband are are in charge of the clothes stall and work with a lot of enthusiasm since they love their work and it is their main source of income.  To arrive at their place of work, Blanca has to get up very early since her place of work is outside the home.  Every day she has to take her son to school, while her husband is in charge of the business.  She currently doesn't have her own home, nor a fixed place where she can sell her products.  This is why they move from one place to another.\r\n\r\nBlanca joined her group as she needed a loan which she used to acquire more goods for her business.  She will use this loan to buy jeans, dress pants, a range of shirts, different types of t-shirt, as well as different sizes and styles of ladies' blouses.  She will also buy socks and underwear.  She mentions to us that occasionally it is difficult work and tiring to travel to other places to sell her products since this means taking her child with her or having to leave him with somebody but she has to do it.  However, as we already mentioned, her love for her son encourages her and her hopes to see him do well give her the strength to carry on.  Sometimes she feels obliged to give away clothes to very poor people who can't manage to buy the most basic items.  She sells at a fair price and doesn't profit from the needs of other, mainly children.\r\n\r\nBlanca's biggest dream is have her own house some day which she can give to her children to support them and also to have her own premises where she can continue with her work so that she no longer has to travel from place to place.  She would like to increase the number of products she sells as much as possible so that she increases her sales and offers a more complete service to her customers.  She also aspires to herself and her husband being able to offer work to other people who need it, to have another outlet and for her son to some day be able to complete his professional studies, so that he doesn't have to go through what his parents are currently going through.\r\n\r\nMost of the people in this group are enterprising women who fight day by day to get ahead and have a better life.  They are faced with the havoc of a difficult life in which many times their dreams never get realized, above all when nobody extends their hand to help their neighbor.  They are responsible people who fulfil their obligations.  They always show that they have the necessary trust in each other and a spirit of mutual help.  They are supportive of each other in everything and have the necessary optimism to keep moving forwards.  In the name of everybody in this group, those of us in the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad team would like to thank those who with their financial help make possible the hope of those who have the least.\r\n\r\nThe names of those who make up the \u201cLuna\u201d group and their business activities are as follows:\r\n\r\nElvira Ofelia R.

Her products are packaged in polystyrene containers.  Heliana learned this trade after having worked several years in a bakery.  She later became unemployed and felt it was time to start her own business so that she could support her children.  Using her savings she bought a small manual grain mill.  Afterwards, she was able to acquire an electric mill and other machines for preparing cornmeal and wheat flour.  From the beginning her products have been well-received.  At first, Heliana sold her products directly to customers by walking through the streets and going door-to-door.  She currently has two salespeople and a permanent employee who helps with production.  Each day, Sra. Heliana produces 100 trays that sell between 2500 and 3000 COP.  Her profit margin, after deducting expenses, is 20%.  With the year-end holidays approaching, her sales will increase considerably.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest the funds in the following manner.  Part of the money will be used to buy supplies such as wheat flour, corn, cheese, yeast, meat, and other ingredients.  The other part will be used to acquire construction materials to renovate the shop where she operates her business.  Sra.

U. is from the village of Brgy. Ibung, Villaverde, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 30 years old. Elizabeth is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Elizabeth owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for breeding. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elizabeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Elizabeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

I. is from the village of Brgy. Maddiangat,Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 54 years old. Loida is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Loida owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fruits and vegetables in the local community. Loida has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Loida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Loida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Loida is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Loida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u1ee9c L\u00e2n nh\u00f3m (Nh\u00f3m 04).\r\n\r\nH. lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. She and her husband have three grown children. She raises chickens for a living. H. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services. She wanted to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2016.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase chicks to raise and sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.496.000 VND, which will be used to purchase chicken feed and other supplies. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n  \r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n  \r\n1.  Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb B., age 35, is requesting a 7.392.000 VND loan to support her business in the food sector, making and selling food.\r\n \r\n2.  \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb D., age 44, is requesting a 2.016.000 VND loan to support her tailoring business.\r\n\r\n3.  T\u00f4 Th\u1ecb T., age 46, is requesting a 5.152.000 VND loan to support her livestock-raising business.\r\n \r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n----\r\n  \r\nH.

H. is from the village of Brgy. Maddiangat, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 46 years old. Levica is married and has five children. To make a living, Levica owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling scrap metal & other used goods in the local community. Levica has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Levica joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Levica has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional scrap goods to sell. Levica is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Levica from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":624074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase new items to expand product offering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

M. is from the village of Brgy. Maddiangat, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 38 years old. Remedios is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Remedios owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fruit and vegetables in the local community. Remedios has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Remedios joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Remedios has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Remedios is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Remedios from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Brgy. Maddiangat, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. He is 34 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Saldy owns and operates a transportation business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating a motorcycle transport service. Saldy has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Saldy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Saldy is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to repair his existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the Saldy's first loan from ASKI.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

V. is from the village of Brgy. Maddiangat,Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 48 years old, married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Pastora owns and operates a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members. Pastora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pastora joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pastora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. Pastora is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment, such as needles and threads. This loan will be the Pastora's second loan from ASKI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her  family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb (20213020014) is a 48-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, L. owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling herbs and spices in the local community.  L. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  L. has successfully repaid a previous L. of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous L. was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  L. is now requesting a new L. of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  This will be the fourth L. taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this L. was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

To make a living, Marites sells vegetables at the market and around her village, using her jeep as transportation. Marites has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair her existing vehicle for her vegetable business. This loan will be her first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Buliwao, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya.

Danilo has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Danilo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Danilo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Danilo is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be his third loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb (20213020013) is a 45-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 3 adult children.  To make a living, L. owns and operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling herbs and spices in the local community.  L. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  L. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  L. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by L. from SEDA.  L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

Harriet, a married mother of four, is full of dynamism, enthusiasm and enterprise. These attributes have stood out as stocks in trade in her small beauty salon and water sales businesses in Seeta-Mukono. She has been operating these businesses for the last 7 years. These businesses generate her 75,000 shillings weekly.

She is married and has 3 adult children.  \r\n\r\nTo make a living, S\u1ef1 owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  S\u1ef1 has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, S\u1ef1 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  S\u1ef1 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  \r\n\r\nS\u1ef1 is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase young livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by her from SEDA.  S\u1ef1 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her  business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nS\u1ef1 Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb (20213020012) l\u00e0 53 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20213020011) is a 36-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Qu\u00fd owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling rice products in the local community.  Qu\u00fd has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Qu\u00fd joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Qu\u00fd has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,944,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  \r\n\r\nQu\u00fd is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & to use as working capital.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by her from SEDA.  Qu\u00fd plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nQu\u00fd D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20213020011) l\u00e0 36 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20201070033) is a 36-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  \r\n\r\nTo make a living, M. owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  M. has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3,800,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, M. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  M. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,704,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase young livestock to raise & sell in the future.  \r\n\r\nM. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the 5th loan she has taken out from SEDA.  M. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.

He is known as a very positive, hardworking person and a grateful son, who lives with his elderly parents and supports them. \r\n\r\n<p>In 1994, in order to find more means of subsistence for his large family, Kydykbek decided to start his own business in cattle breeding. Over the past 16 years, his efforts have been aimed at supporting and expanding his household. He has managed to multiply the number of cattle and today he has four milk cows, five sheep, five lambs and one horse. Also, Kydykbek began cultivating potatoes and holy clover on a plot of land and worked hard to get a good harvest of high quality products. \r\n\r\n<p>Now Kydykbek is applying for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy five bull calves for fattening and resale. With the revenues from this investment, he plans to broaden his business by purchasing more cattle for fattening. His plans for the future include providing a higher education to his daughters; he dreams of seeing them as progressive-minded persons. \r\n\r\n<p>Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading microfinance institutions in Kyrgyzstan.

Huon M. is a 33-year-old married woman.  She is a villager living in Ampil village, Kandal province. \r\n\r\nMrs. Huon M. and her husband, Mr. Met Kuok, are farmers who own a plot of rice field that they use to cultivate rice for a living. \r\n\r\nFor this farm, they do not have enough money to buy fertilizer and pesticide to cultivate rice.

H. has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,600,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  \r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  The loan will be her 5th loan taken out from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  \r\n\r\nTo make a living, H. owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,100,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  \r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & to use as working capital.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by her from SEDA.

A. is from the village of Manila Group, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 35 years old. Jolinda is separated from her spouse and has 5 school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Jolinda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling vegetables & spices like garlic, onion, ginger, cabbage, red bell pepper & tomatoes in the local community. Jolinda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jolinda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. \r\n\r\nJolinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional vegetables to buy and sell. Jolinda is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jolinda from HSPFI.

2008, Alma joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI partner of KIVA in the Philippines. With her first loan, she ventured into the retail selling of charcoal. Charcoal is the most common means of cooking foods for the poor people living in very remote areas of the province. Aside from its affordable price, it is also the most conveniently accessed commodity for everyone from their distant village.\r\n\r\nShe had observed the demand for charcoal in the market and knew that selling charcoal would bring them enough profit for their day-to-day living. Now on her second loan, she is requesting 9,500 pesos as additional capital for her business. The loan will be used to pay for inventory of charcoal. Alma is hopeful that, with the financial access that she has from ASHI, she can improve her business and make it grow.\r\n\r\nAlma came from a poor family. During her childhood, she dreamed of finishing her studies, but due to financial shortages, she was not able to make it. Now, her dream for her own children is to send them to school until they finish college and find jobs, so that they will not suffer the life that she had. She hopes that her business will grow and be sustainable, and is looking forward to having a space at the market someday. She aspires to have her own house and lot in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":637940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Sarah saw the counter-productive effects of poor planning, ineptitude and the hasty rush for financial returns on her close friend\u2019s ill-fated businesses that she says taught her a lesson.  She made deductions that the above factors contributed to the unraveling of her friend\u2019s businesses. It is for that reason that 6 years ago, she decided to begin her cosmetics selling business on a totally different slate. Sarah has come to terms with the fact that hard work, focus, and constant planning are invaluable for the success of any business.

She works selling soft drinks such as 'bolis' (a frozen, natural-fruit-based drink), corn and rice 'chicha', Pony Malta, sodas and beers which give her a 15% profit.  She started her business when she discovered that her husband was suffering from a brain disease and she had to take over the reins in their household. \r\n\r\nThis is her 20th loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to use it to add a room to her house so that they will be more comfortable with her soft drinks business, her family, her customers and herself.  With the loans she has received from this organization, her children have managed to study, her business has become stronger and she has increased her independence.

a\u00f1os desde  su antigua m\u00e1quina con la que inici\u00f3, se ha movido en la actividad de confecciones en  las l\u00edneas femeninas e infantil, primero lo hizo \"sobre medidas\", es decir los

Este es su segundo financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y se siente muy satisfecha con la inyecci\u00f3n de capital de trabajo, pues ahora  tiene un dinero  adicional para seguir comprando telas e insumos,  fabricar ropa, aumentar sus ventas y generar utilidades, que mucho le han ayudado a mejorar las  condiciones de su vivienda, porque este es justamente uno de sus sue\u00f1os: \u201cel de terminar de construir su casa, y tambi\u00e9n ver a sus hijos culminar su carrera profesional;  este es el motivo principal de  su inspiraci\u00f3n diaria,  para hacer una oferta que verdaderamente mantenga a sus clientes rentables y aumente el n\u00famero de ellos, porque conoce  que finalmente este prop\u00f3sito se vera reflejado en utilidades y as\u00ed mismo en su bienestar y crecimiento personal.

At first she was doing this on commission, i.e. customers bring their fabrics and supplies and show the designs they want, which she then interprets; then Delly takes the body measurements and makes the dress.  This she says was learning by doing, but today she is a little more comfortable because she has managed to have all the raw materials and supplies purchased herself, to produce clothes in different sizes and sell them.\r\n\r\nThis is her second financing with Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and she is very pleased with the injection of working capital.  She now has extra money to keep buying fabric and supplies and making clothes, to increase her sales and profitability.  This will greatly help improve their housing conditions, which is only one of her dreams.  \"Finishing construction of her house and also seeing her children build their career\", this is the main reason for her daily inspiration to provide an offering that truly retains her profitable customers and increases the number of them.

A. Rodr\u00edguez de 54 a\u00f1os, procedente del departamento de Bol\u00edvar desde el a\u00f1o de 1999 en condiciones de desplazamiento, lleg\u00f3 a Barranquilla con su esposo y sus 9 hijos en las edades de 14 a 27 y  se le ocurri\u00f3 la idea de elaborar bollos (Envueltos a base de ma\u00edz y queso) aprovechando el conocimiento de la t\u00e9cnica y su experiencia en el oficio; fue as\u00ed como inici\u00f3 con 13 mazorcas y elabor\u00f3 12 bollos que vendi\u00f3, y que desde ese momento, se han convertido en el sustento principal de su hogar, pues en la actualidad ha aumentado su producci\u00f3n a 100 bollos diarios. Si usted  visita a Elena puede encontrarla en pleno proceso, con sus compa\u00f1eros de producci\u00f3n, que son sus hijos,: entre todos deshojan el ma\u00edz , desprenden los granos, que someten a molienda, para luego amasarlos, envolverlos en las mismas hojas del bollo, amarrarlos y finalmente someterlos a la respectiva cocci\u00f3n; para que cuando ya est\u00e1n listos, puedan ser adquiridos mediante su compra por los clientes, ubicados en el mismo barrio donde vive y especialmente  en tiendas del sector, all\u00ed son vendidos al consumidor final. Para el desarrollo de esta actividad, Elena cuenta con un molino el\u00e9ctrico, al que ya es hora de hacerle una buena reparaci\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n tiene   todos las herramientas necesaria para el proceso; Este es su segundo financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con \u00e9l comprar\u00e1 enseres menores, reparar\u00e1 su molino,  y comprar\u00e1 laminas de eternit, cemento y baldosas  para adecuar su pisos y proteger su espacio productivo, debido a que cuando llueve se filtra el agua, generando condiciones de deterioro e inseguridad al trabajar.\nElena cuenta, que antes de estar vinculada a la Fundaci\u00f3n, manten\u00eda cr\u00e9ditos costosos para poder comprar su materia prima e insumos, ahora se siente mas tranquila porque est\u00e1 mas holgada con el capital adicional que le presta esta organizaci\u00f3n; igualmente manifiesta que su negocio ha crecido tanto en ventas como en estructura con este impulso. Su sue\u00f1o se concentra  mas adelante en finalizar su vivienda, para mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales, que tanto convienen tambi\u00e9n al negocio, en su imagen y presentaci\u00f3n y este es justamente su gran desaf\u00edo.\n","en":"Elena A. Rodr\u00edguez is 54 years old.  She has lived in Bol\u00edvar department since 1999.  She arrived in Barranquilla with her husband and her 9 children aged between 14 and 27.  She had the idea to start making 'bollos' (corn and cheese-based wraps), making use of her knowledge and experience in the business.  She started with 13 corncobs and made 12 'bollos' which she then sold.  From that moment, her business has become the main source of support for her household.  She has increased her production to 100 'bollos' a day.  If you visited Elena you would find her in the middle of making her 'bollos' with her children who are her production colleagues.  Between them they shuck the corn, remove the grain which they then mill, make the dough, wrap the 'bollos' up in the corn husks, tie them up and finally cook them.  When they are ready they are bought by her customers who are in her neighborhood, especially those who own stores where the 'bollos' are finally sold to the end customer.\r\n\r\nTo carry out her activity, Elena has an electric mill which now needs to be repaired and all the other equipment which she needs for her production process.  This is the second loan which Elena has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy small utensils, to repair her mill and to buy corrugated metal sheeting, cement and tiles to adapt her premises and protect her production space because when it rains the water drips in which causes damage and lack of safety while she is working.\r\n\r\nElena tells us that before she was a member of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she used expensive loans to buy raw material and ingredients.  Now she feels more relaxed because she is more comfortable with the capital which this organization provides her with.  She also says that her business has grown both in terms of sales and in structure as a result of this investment.  Her dream for the future is to finish the building work on her home, to improve her living conditions which are so important for her business too both in terms of image and presentation.  This is her biggest challenge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":638091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
