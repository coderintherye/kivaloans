He used these items to make ready-to-wear women's dresses and camisoles, men's pants and shirts, and school uniforms for middle and high school students that have sold well. His daily sales have increased substantially. He has revenues of 50,000 and 150,000 francs per day, and in addition, he has not experienced any difficulty repaying his loan. With the second loan, he intends to bolster his stock of fabrics and yardages as well as to buy a new sewing machine to expand the apprentice sewing workshop for young mothers.

With his first loan, he was able to increase his inventory and his sales, which earned him more income.  His biggest challenge is having a location for his business along the commercial corridor, which will boost sales because of its good location.

She is separated from her husband and lives in her own house with her son. Every day of the week, Otilia sells ice cream at the entrance of the high school that is 10 blocks from her house. The students say that she does this work with great kindness and charisma. This is why Otilia waits in her habitual place outside the education center to sell her ice creams at the entrance and exit of the classes. This work has been profitable for her despite the competition, but the competition does not discourage her and she continues to work and sell her goods with a real commitment to succeeding. She has been doing this work for 30 years and it is her main source of income. She wants to grow her business and make it more profitable by selling other types of ice cream of the most recognized brand. This is her 16th loan from MFP and she assures us that this loan will be very beneficial to the development of her business. She is a loved and respected member of her community bank, and for these reasons she is the leader of the group. She is requesting this loan so that she can stock more ice cream for the coming summer season. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":639264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To stock-up on ice cream.

To his surprise, it actually looked pretty good! He started doing haircuts for all his friends on a regular basis and when he went to college at Savannah ST. College, he cut hair on the side to make some money. \r\n\r\nWhen Avery had just a bit too much fun with his college fraternity, Avery\u2019s father convinced him to go into the military. In the military, Avery was the \u201cgo-to\u201d barber. He says, \u201cAfter doing 60 haircuts in a day, I really learned how to cut hair.\u201d When he finished his service in the military in 1988, it was difficult for Avery to find a job he was interested in. His friend convinced him to go to cosmetology school. Avery then obtained his cosmetology license, his barber\u2019s license and, with a scholarship from the school, an instructor\u2019s license. \r\n\r\nAvery and his sister then started a beauty salon that they managed together for 15 years. In 2004, Avery was ready to start his own salon, \"The Masters by Avery\". He had developed such a loyal clientele that some of his clients helped him start this new business financially. He bought two chairs, two mirrors, two lights, and picnic chairs to begin with. The last-minute medley of furniture  did not deter his clients from coming! Avery continued to add items month by month to have a  salon with more sophisticated amenities. He has over 125 clients, and three stylists rent work-stations in his salon. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Avery plans to replace two dryers, a basin (for washing hair), chairs, and buy a new television for the clients to enjoy. Avery says, \u201cThese upgrades will contribute to a more relaxing environment and help put the clients and the stylists more at ease, and even make the stylists more motivated to make the business thrive.\u201d\r\n\r\nAvery hopes to build his business\u2019 name into that of a prestigious salon that provides quality service in the Baton Rouge community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":632172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

L. is from the town of Palilan, Jimenez Mis. Occ. Philippines. She is 49 years old. Hospe is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Hospe owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of products in the local community. Hospe has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Hospe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hospe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in renovating the business. Hospe is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Hospe from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

G. is from the town of Pan-ay Diot Tudela, Mis. Occ. Philippines. She is 44 years old, married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Marialitata owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of products in the local community. Marialitata has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marialitata joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marialitata has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Marialitata is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Marialitata from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Tabon. She is 52 years old, married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Victoria owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Victoria has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Victoria joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Victoria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Victoria is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Victoria from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":636372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

C. is from the village of Tabon. She is 36 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Evangeline owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evangeline joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Evangeline from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":636290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Lilia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Lilia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

G. is from the village of Piao. She is 38 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Liezl owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Liezl is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liezl joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liezl has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Liezl is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Liezl from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She receives orders from neighboring areas and is able to help pay the family's utility bills with her business. She and her family live in Sahiwal, a small city in Pakistan known for its agriculture industry. They reside in an area named Essa Nagri in a two-bedroom house.\r\n \r\nRashida's husband, Yunus M., is involved in a food-selling business. He makes Punjabi food dishes such as Nan chanay (made with chickpeas and served with bread, pickle, and salad) and Daal chawal (made with rice and lentils). These two dishes are the specialty of his business and people from different areas of Sahiwal city come to him to buy his food. He has operated his business for 25 years and has established a good name in his area for the quality and taste of his food.\r\n  \r\nRashida and her husband have a son and two daughters. They couldn\u2019t educate any of their children due to poor financial conditions. Their son started work in his teens and works as a shoe polisher.\r\n\r\nRashida has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy items such as lentils, cooking oil, and spices in bulk quantities that will enable him to prepare large amounts of food to sell to his customers. Rashida believes that an investment in her husband\u2019s long-standing business will bring about positive changes in her family life.

First, she manages a small storefront out of her home. She sells basic goods to her neighbors, including detergent, hygienic supplies, fruits, vegetables, rice, beverages and candy. She also raises small animals in the yard behind her home. Finally, from her small beehive she raises bees and harvests honey, which she sells in her store or to local artisan dealers.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan will be used to expand the inventory in her general store. She finds that she often does not have enough goods to make sales for the full day and that her clients at times are searching for items that are not in stock. She would like to increase her inventory in order to take advantage of this additional demand. She also plans to use the funds to improve her other activities and support herself in general."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":639680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to expand the inventory in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P\u00edtipo -

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a wife and a mother of four daughters and two sons. Alya is married to Robin, who owns an auto repair workshop. Alya's husband has been working in this field for eight years now. The workshop is located on the main street and attracts a lot of new customers.\n\nAlya came to FATEN and took out a loan to help her husband pay off the rent and purchase the repair tools he needs in his work. Alya's husband Robin appears in the picture in his workshop because Alya is very religious. \n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

E. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Sta. Rosa, Poblacion, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: candle-making and a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband, Miguel E., who is 51 years old, works as a Quality Control Supervisor to earn his living. They have five children who are between 16 and 24 years old. Two of the children have their own families, one has work and two are still going to school. Marilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase  raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future, improve her business and help the needs of their family. Marilou E. is a Dungganon who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have eight children who are between 4 and 26 years old. Three of her children already have a family, two have work and one is currently going to school. Editha joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Editha has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock and a motorized boat so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education. Editha P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 21,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,500, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her  children.  Lorelie C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

G. is 48-years old, married and supports her family by operating a pig-fattening business.  She lives in Punta Balidbid, Brgy. Balidbid, Sta. Fe, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig-fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She currently earns an average monthly income of 11000 PHP. Lolita is now borrowing 15000 PHP to use as additional working capital.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 20000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lolita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has 6 children who are between 18 and 29 years old; 4 of them have family and 2 are currently working and helping her. \r\n\r\nLourdes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lourdes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing 15000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Lourdes A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Remedios has successfully repaid a previous loan of 35000 PHP from ASKI. Remedios is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP that will be used to purchase fertilizer, such as manure. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Remedios from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Jr., who is 50 years old, works both as a fisherman and as a carpenter to earn his living. They have four children who are between 5 and 19 years old. \r\n\r\nAmelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $208, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase a motorized fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarilou is married and has 4 adult-aged children. To make a living, Marilou owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activiies.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Marilou joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 36000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nMarilou is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Marilou from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Mina is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Mina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees  for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":636519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer such as manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

They have two children who are 14 and 17 years old. \r\n\r\nLorna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks of clothes to sell to customers so that she could continue to save up for future improvements of her business and education of her children. Lorna E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
