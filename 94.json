Saodat's main customers are her neighbors. <p> Her husband is a construction worker, which is only a seasonal job. For this reason, her occupation is the main source of income for their family.

Since a teacher's salary is tiny, she supplements her income by raising cattle. Saltanathon has more then six years of experience in animal husbandry. Her cattle business is the main source of income for the family since her husband is currently unemployed. Saltanathon purchases young calves at the market, fattens them and sells them for a higher price for meat. Currently she would like to purchase two more calves. Her own savings are not enough and she has decided to take out a loan to finance the purchase. Saltanathon is planning to pay back the loan int he next 12 months.\r\n \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

When she first borrowed money, she used it to breed chickens and pigs. Her income from breeding pigs and chickens was used for expanding the farm, increasing the number of animals. In 2006, Mrs. T. switched from breeding pigs and chickens to investing in building material such as bricks, cements, tiles, etc. Her store provides materials for many building projects and also satisfies local needs. Besides, she collects wasted material. In 2007, Mrs. T. was able to build a 3-storey house of 150 meter square area. This time, she wants to borrow 1200 USD to buy more bricks, sands and gravels. Her average income is 300 USD\/month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Phan Th\u1ecb Th\u1ee7y, 35 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2000.

This loan is urgent because winter is coming up and she needs to have the land ready for sowing. <p> Teacher T. is a loyal client because she started getting loans when the institution opened its doors to the waged-earning sector in 2001, when no banks or micro financing institutions would risk to work with vulnerable sectors.  She feels fulfilled with the attention given to her, that's why she is still with us, she has an excellent sense of morality to pay back and most of the time she repays her loans one or two months in advance.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMilena de 47 a\u00f1os, soltera, no tiene hijos, habita junto a su familia (mam\u00e1 y hermanos), desde muy jovencita a la edad de 17 a\u00f1os inicio el apostolado del magisterio de manera empirica, cuando estudiaba el 3er a\u00f1o de bachillerato, con su propio esfuerzo ha logrado superarse, ya que obtuvo su titulo de maestra de educacion primaria, tecnico medio en contabilidad y actualmente esta estudiando la Licenciatura en Pedagogia.  Como ha sido criada en el campo, ademas de la docencia realiza labores productivas con el apoyo de sus hermanos.  Con los 8 creditos anteriores ha comprado 3 vaquillas y un semental, los que herra con el fierro de su mama, este noveno credito lo utilizara para la siembra de 3 Mzs de zacate mejorado para la alimentacion de sus animales y 3 Mzs de maiz para el autoconsumo, la urgencia de este credito es porque ya se aproxima el invierno y quiere tener el terreno preparado para la siembra. <p>La profesora T. ha sido una cliente fiel, pues inicio con sus creditos cuando la institucion abre las puertas al sector asalariado en el a\u00f1o 2001, cuando ningun bancio ni microfiananciera se arriesgab a a trabajar con los sectores vulnerables.

Because they did not have any money or a place to go and because they did not receive any aid from the government, they decided to establish their villages there. Many of the Marketalia\u2019s inhabitants feel as though they are victims of the current system. Therefore, they often complain about their situations: the fact that they are poor and the lack of opportunities that exist for them to prosper. Further, they believe that the government should be responsible for fixing their problems.<p> \r\nFortunately, however, ever since Fundacion Paraguaya formed a committee of entrepreneurial women in Marketalia, this idea of waiting for the government to fix such problems began to vanish. In fact, the members of committee \u201cLa Esperanza\u201d (hope) realized that they could do many things to bring prosperity to their lives. Indeed, the group members serve as great examples for the other individuals in the area because the group members' successful businesses make other villagers realize that each one of them is capable of changing his or her own world for the better without the need for governmental involvement. <p>\r\nMore specifically, the group is comprised of 15 women whose businesses include: despensas (grocery stores), copetines (mini bar-restaurants), sewing shops, dress-making shops and shops where cloths, drinks, food and ice cream are sold.

He then sells the produce at  Dushanbe markets. Gulom wants to take out this loan to expand the amount of goods he is able to offer at his market stall.

The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot, sticky dough, made from maize flour), a plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":155148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more kitchen utensil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-28T03:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-12T04:38:43Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-06-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":236567,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-07-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":265358,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294314,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":324844,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357327,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-04-28T04:38:43Z","paid_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":46894,"name":"Recho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Kyela Mbeya, Tanzania!

She also plans to extend electricity to her place of work so that she stops using diesel for running the mill.<p>\r\nBetty has paid back more than 7 loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":155175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Her plans are to start buying maize for grinding, packing, and selling flour .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-04-29T01:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-13T07:06:57Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":168000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":237462,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":168000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":266358,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":168000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":295359,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-14T07:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":168000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":326018,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-23T07:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":168000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":359172,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":167999.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334377,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-04-29T07:06:57Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T21:51:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":46907,"name":"Forba John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John N. is married with five children.
