He grew up in a very large family, with 3 sisters and 3 brothers while his parents were simple workers. After finishing high school Omburek was trained as a tractor driver and helped his parents with their farm. In 1985 Omburek  married and chose to remain living with his parents who were raising cattle and farming at the time. His first daughter was born in 1985 and in 1995 Omburek became a father of a second girl. After working with the community farm (kolhoz) for three years Omburek decided to start his own farm. He used a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS) to purchase a cow and start his cattle raising business. At first Omburek has fallen on hard times, as towards the end of the 90s his family grew to six people and he was struggling to provide for clothing and shoes, while his wife had to stay home and take care of the little ones. After the fall of the Soviet Union his community farm fell apart and the money Omburek was making was barely enough to purchase food for everyone. At that time Omburek decided to also start farming, and began growing sugar beets at his house plot. He was selling his harvest to the local sugar factory and using the profits to purchase more livestock. Now Omburek's household has flourished and he owns two milk cows, two heifers and a calf and he also offers his tractor driving skills during the planting season to the other local farmers. His wife is now able to help a lot more with the farm as two of his five children are already in college while the youngest three are all attending school. Omburek himself is not only a good businessman but also a wonderful loving husband and father.\r\n\r\nIn order to further expand his livestock business and purchase more animals, Omburek has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS). In the future Omburek dreams of expanding his farm as well and buying new farming equipment for himself. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":935087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Panfilovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omurbek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T02:51:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366205,"name":"Lutacho No.7 A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is the facilitator of the Lutacho No.7 A group.

He previously worked at a cotton-ball processing facility, but his profit there was low.  He decided to close that business and get involved in fattening up livestock.  He has two cows at that time.  Each cow produced up to 20 liters of milk daily, and neighbors bought dairy products from Uktam, and his grandsons had only dairy products for breakfast.  Uktam was offered a large amount of money for his cows, but he did not want to sell because this was his main source of income.  Having learned about our organization in 2007, Uktam obtained a loan from us and purchased one more bull.  Soon after, he started to breed and sell livestock.  Throughout the four-year partnership, he leased a plot of land outside the town and purchased two more cows and two more bulls.  He spent the entire summer on that land and planted radish and carrots there, using the money from each sold livestock.  And now, he sells his harvest.  Livestock is cheaper during winter than during warm seasons, and this is why Uktam plans to use this loan to purchase four more cows.  Currently, he and his family are grateful to the creditors for the financial support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":935094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T19:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uktam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":651.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":682.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":651.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":682.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-11T10:35:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366257,"name":"Sop Serigne Fallou Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 Sop Serigne Fallou a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e le 20 avril 2010.

They work in the fields and in this way she supported and educated her children, who now have their own families and educations.\r\n\r\nWith the same hard work, Marcela opened a small food store, where she sells primary needs products.  The local inhabitants begin visiting her store during the first hours of the day, because they know the amount of goods she stocks.  She needs to invest in merchandise.  \u201cI never get careless about my businesses, because they are vital for me,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nShe also makes, sells, and repairs clothing.  In this way she generates extra income for any eventuality.  As if that was not enough, she also buys and sells coffee, which she sells to the cooperatives in the city. \r\n\r\nMarcela says that, thanks to her work, she has managed to create an adequate life, which has allowed her to buy some things that she could not previously afford.  She will continue this rhythm into her old age.  Thanks to your help, this will be her 10th loan through MFP.  For this reason, she promises to make her payments on time.  She says that she feels comfortable with her communal bank, because of all the work they do together.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy pants, toys, and some clothing and decorations for her grocery store.  She knows that sales will be greater in the coming days.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.65,"image":{"id":935448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing and toys to sell for the Christmas season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-05T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":148.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":156.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":162.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":171.14},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":176.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":183.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.86,"local_amount":148.96,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":150.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836251,"comment":null},{"amount":58.68,"local_amount":156.48,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":158.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246011,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":162.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":164.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386038,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T10:54:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366408,"name":"Edith Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia es la Sra.

Yanet as a hardworking woman, works as a farmer. On her hectares of farmland she grows bananas and coffee which she sells in the city of Merced to the coffee cooperatives who give her a good price for her products. \"The coffee from this region is well sought after which is why my crop sells quickly,\" she comments. For his part, Hugo, her partner, works in the fields, cleaning and spreading manure; for the harvest he has to hire manual labourers as it is hard work. And when the work in the fields is finished, Hugo works on other neighbouring propeties as a labourer and so earns an income day to day. Not content, Yanet also has a coffee plant nursery and sells the plants at 400 to 450 soles per thousand. Yanet hopes to give her children a good education and will continue to work hard and long to achieve this. This would be her 10th loan with MFP and for this reason she agrees to be punctual with her repayments as she was with her past loan cycles. In addition she mentions feeling very happy with her communal bank as she was one of the founding members. On receiving the money, Yanet will invest in the purchase of manure, coffee plants and bags to be used in the nurseries.\r\n

She lives with her husband and her two children who are 24 and 13 years old, she loves them very much, all living comfortably in their own house. Emilia creates clothing for women such as lingerie and underwear for children. She began the business with financial support that was enough to buy her first sewing machine that she set up in her own home.\n\nHer first customers were her relatives but little by little she won more clients among her friends and neighbors, thanks to the good work she learned from her sister 15 years ago. Currently she is studying in a vocational training center in order to become perfect. \n\nWhat she likes about her work is being able to focus and remain busy permitting her to have income, in order to give a better quality of life to her family. On the other hand, what bothers her is the physical fatigue from being in the same position for many hours, but this does not dishearten her and she hopes to be able to open a boutique in her own home.\n\nThis will be her first loan with MFP, therefore she is waiting for assistance, in order to continue with her plans and she promises to make her payments on time, once again, in order to have a good credit record. She likes being a part of the communal bank because all the people are trustworthy and very supportive.\n\nWith the 1000 soles from the loan she will buy a new sewing machine costing 700 soles and the balance will be used to buy sewing supplies such as fabrics, thread, and other items.

The family business that Reyna has is the manufacturing of iron chairs. She started in this business because she suffered a work accident and is now receiving a pension settlement. From said settlement, she invested in the business that she now has, which is the fabrication of chairs, to later sell to traders in the central zone of the city and also in the zone where they live. What she likes about her livelihood, is working in the company of her husband, supporting each other. In this way, the earnings that it gives them are 300 nuevos soles for each dozen delivered. However, that which she does not like about their business is that the welding is affecting her husband\u2019s vision. For that, she has thought of delegating this part of the job to another shop. At the same time, she has plans to grow her business, opening a new store selling motor parts. This will be her first loan with the MFP Institution, in which she relies on their collaboration to be able to realize her plans.

She\u2019s single and lives comfortably in her parents\u2019 house with her father, her mother and two siblings who are 24 and 15 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nSindy has a family business that she shares with her parents and siblings; she is the manager.  It consists in manufacturing metal, coal-burning stoves.  She started this activity 10 years ago thanks to the initiative of one of her brothers-in-law who taught this occupation to her father and then he passed down these skills to his children.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe business has grown and the product is in high demand.  All the family members participate and they also have a helper who is paid by the completed unit.  What she likes about her activity is the income which helps to cover household expenses as well as the family unity that the business creates.

She lives alone because her husband left for work 15 years ago and never returned.  Her granddaughter helps her with the business.  Besides this, Tuhfa works as a history teacher at the University.  During the days, when she works at the university, her granddaughter helps her grandmother.  Tuhfa cannot travel for merchandise herself due to her health and age, and her friends or relatives deliver merchandise to her.  They bring merchandise from Kyrgyzstan in 4-5 days.  Tuhfa plans to bring in warm clothing, such as sweaters and robes, and fabrics, such as velour, velvet and other stylish national fabrics.  Currently, this is a prime season for her business because sales will be good before the New Year's, since women will be sewing nice dresses for the
