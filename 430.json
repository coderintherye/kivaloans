The parish is known for its church but even better known for its culinary expertise, with a great number of local specialties such as oven-roasted pork and barbecued guinea-pig. \r\n\r\nSonia is a seamstress. She studied her trade in a vocational college and has had her own workshop for the past 6 years now. She works from home, sewing women's and children's clothes. Working from home means she doesn't have fixed hours. Sonia is 33 years old, and married with 2 children aged 13 and 3. Her elder son is in high school and her husband is a carpenter. They don't have their own house, but are renting. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan and it was thanks to her sister-in-law that Sonia became part of this lovely group of determined women. The new loan will be invested in fabric for her business. Her goal is to learn and become more skilled at her trade.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva

is Leticia D. C., a widow at 55, resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She has a child who is struggling through his high school years.  By the grace of God, Leticia has managed to support her child\u2019s schooling by herself.  At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. A dream for most poor Filipino parents like Leticia as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nLeticia operates a bakery. Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine, and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the Pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students and workers. It is also packed hot into a Styrofoam box and sold in the streets, mostly recognized by the honking of the bicycle boy who carries and sells them. Leticia\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nLeticia hopes that her business will be successful one day, enough for her to buy her own house, lot, and car for her retirement.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":570141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"buying raw

She is glad to be associated with Faulu Kenya, a Kiva partner, because she is able to access loans and save money on a weekly basis.  \r\n\r\nShe previously took out a loan of 20,000 Kenyan shillings (KES), which she used to improve her business. She was able to pay the loan without any challenge; hence, she has been allowed to take out another loan of 40,000 KES. She will use the loan to purchase sugar, cooking fat, rice and crates of soda. She hopes to expand her shop into a wholesale business in five

H. is 33 years old. She lives in the small town of La Concepci\u00f3n. She married to Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1ceres and has three children who are 16, 15, and 13 years old. Three years ago she and her husband opened a small grocery store in their home. Now they also have a small store located in the municipal bus terminal where her husband sells all kinds of fruits and vegetables. She works from 5:30AM until 6:0PM. Her father taught her to work.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy a large variety of seasonal fruits and also vegetables, dairy products, basic grains like rice, corn, and beans, pastas, sauces, condiments, etc. With this loan, she will be able to offer her customers more and different products. She will also have more income to use to cover the school costs for her children and also to feed her family.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges she faces is that the location where they have the fruit and vegetable business isn\u2019t very good. Every month they have to pay rent and oftentimes sales aren\u2019t very good. However, she can count on the income from the small grocery store she has in their home, and that way she can help her husband. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her children grow up healthy and for them to be professionals and very hardworking. She also hopes that the location where they have the fruit and vegetable business can someday belong to them. \r\n\r\nShe has been a client with FAMA for 10 years and it is thanks to the loans that she has received that she has her current business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

started her house-cleaning business four years ago in her hometown in Massachusetts, supporting her family who live both in the United States and in Brazil. Gina has no employees and her husband and son both work at different companies.\r\n\r\nFour years ago Gina started her house-cleaning business because she saw that the cleaning business was strong in the U.S. She saw the opportunity to grow in this area by starting a business in her hometown. Now, she hopes to gain more clients by using her first ACCION USA loan to advertise her business. She plans to make her services more visible in the surrounding area because there is a large population she has not yet targeted.\r\n\r\nGina loves being her own boss and having that personal contact with her clients. Her greatest challenge was having the courage to start her own business. Now, she is confident enough in her service and day-to-day operations that she wants to further grow her clientele. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":570288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To

With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She lives in Purok 1, Barangay Albiga, Siaton, Negros Oriental.\r\n\r\nTeresita has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her hog raising and pedicab businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 9,000 a month. \r\n\r\nTeresita is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she can add to her working capital and sustainably operate and expand her businesses. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.\r\n\r\nTeresita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

With that realization, she is requesting a much larger loan to finance the sustainability of her two businesses and to put up a small store in front of her house so that she can sell foodstuffs and vegetables.

hardworking mother and wife, Anita Sta. M. dreams of having their own fishing boat so that her husband, who is a fisherman, will have his own means for fishing and have bigger earnings than working with other people financing his business. With this, the woman who handles the cash flow for her family would be able to have a strong financial source to support their needs, as well as to support the immediate needs of her six children and their own family members. Someday, she hopes that through the business she has been able to grow, she can help improve their lifestyle, especially that of her grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan Anita is requesting presently, she believes that a step to achieving her above mentioned desires will be undertaken. She will purchase a motorboat for fishing. That way, she will have more fish to sell directly to people within their village and in the neighboring villages. Her selling activity would also be more regular because her husband\u2019s time wouldn\u2019t be controlled by other people or an employer perhaps.

D. is from the village of Katutungan, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 42 years old. Rosemela is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosemela owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste and also selling and dealing products from different suppliers in the local community. Rosemela has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 8500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosemela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosemela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Rosemela is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Rosemela from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":570637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

G. is from the village of  Kidahon Malinao, Gingoog City. She is 38 years old and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Noralyn runs a sari-sari (variety) shop selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Noralyn has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Noralyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Noralyn is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Noralyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI: HSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Her determination to ensure that her three children graduate from college and to improve the family's lifestyle has inspired her to have faith and work hard. Throughout her membership in ASHI, she has maintained an excellent performance in terms of her loan repayments, attendance at weekly center meetings and rice production in her farming business, thereby ensuring that the entire amount she requests from ASHI is granted to her. With the support of her loving husband, Gerardo, who is a farmer, Flor has been able to earn additional proceeds with which to finance the education of her children. Thus far, her two eldest children have graduated, while Flor continues to sustain the education of her youngest in college.<p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Flor has only one child left in college, she still has the responsibility of supporting the whole family because her two graduated children are not yet employed and so are without their own sources of income.  As well, her husband had a stroke recently, leaving half of his body paralyzed and his  productivity severely limited. Despite concern for her husband and her entire family, Flor took the opportunity to discover her own productive capabilities for their survival. She is requesting a much larger loan than usual through ASHI to support the increasing financial demands of her rice production since she must now hire a farm laborer to perform the tasks formerly done by her husband. <p>\r\n\r\nAfter harvest, Flor will have to wholesale their rice to have something to re-invest for the next cropping (planting) season, which is twice a year, and for the tuition fees of her child in college. She also has to support the medicines needed by her husband to ensure that he recovers and then maintains his health.

C. is 53 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Tosontsengel, a city of Zavhan province, western Mongolia. His wife operates a clothing sewing business and his elder son works in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia while the youngest son attends a local middle school. The family has been living in their current home for 22 years. Banzragch makes iron items in his own shop near the family home. He started this business in 1995 and has since made quality products for the people of his province. He has found out the advantage of his business is that there are very few people in his province operating an ironsmith business supplying local citizens with ironwork products. Banzragch also wants to expand his business by making more products and further improve his family\u2019s financial situation and the quality of life. Banzragch is a very modest person. He is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT loan to buy more iron and welding products for his

Somehow, it is such a great help for him to provide for some of his needs, but most of the time he is dependent on his mother just like his sister.\r\n\r\nSustainability of her fish-selling business is always the worry of Teresita because most of her income, including the supposed return of investment to her business, is used to support her family, as it is the only source of their livelihood. No matter how hard she carries her fish over head or in a basket held by her two hands to sell her fish directly to people in their houses, and village after village, still her income over the expenses of her family is insufficient. However, she is still hopeful that with the loans she can take through ASHI, her business will be sustainable and profitable until her child has graduated from college and their lives have improved

R. is a married woman who lives in GK Village, Brgy Villareal, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending business.  \r\n\r\nAurelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aurelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus raising her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th cycle loan, Aurelia is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business in order to continue to save up for future renovations of her house. Aurelia R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":570302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Prior to that, 45-year-old M. Nulu was eking out a relatively low-level living with profits from her modest salon business. The tough experience mill she was brought to terms with whilst still running her salon business was enough to help her dispense with the naivet\u00e9 of operating a business. The only reliable stock in trade she had to employ in her new business was a strong resolve to succeed and a focused, clear, and sustainable plan of action. These attributes have been her mileage in an invariably competitive retail business field. \r\n\r\nHer shop has an array of goods on display ranging from bags of sugar, bars of soap, and rice. In the course of time, Nulu has come to the realization that never losing sight of one\u2019s objectives principally in operating a business is of paramount importance if one is to achieve short-term and long-term success. \r\n\r\nThough her business doesn\u2019t bring in hefty profits going by the 20,000 shillings she reckons she makes in a week, she is upbeat that her prospects will only get better as long as she can continue biding her time patiently. She is high on conviction that with this loan, she will be able to buy more retail items for her shop. She is looking at buying more bags of sugar, salt, rice and bars of soap, as these are highly demanded items in her locality. She figures she will be able to earn more revenue as a result of the restocking of her shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":570744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"The purchase of retail items like bags of sugar,salt and rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-27T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nulu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azamu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sauba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2200000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":137500},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":137500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":562750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689462,"comment":null},{"amount":250.43,"local_amount":550950,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":563722.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903608,"comment":null},{"amount":258.98,"local_amount":569750,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":582957.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297080,"comment":null},{"amount":240.59,"local_amount":529300,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":541570.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467356,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-27T19:36:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215877,"name":"Wolale Iv Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":" WOLALE IV  est un regroupement de 10 femmes mari\u00e9es du village de CINZARA dans la pr\u00e9fecture  de SAN r\u00e9gion de SEGOU (quatri\u00e8me  r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).

After the rainy season, the harvest will be warehoused long enough for its value to increase, before it is sold at the great market in San and at the nearby markets, retail (or often wholesale) for cash to resellers who mostly come from big towns.\r\n\r\nAfter their produce is sold, the group members expect to make a profit of 17,000 to 18,500 CFA francs each, which they will use to pay the interest on the loan and ongoing family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":570802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming supplies, seeds and small equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Cinzara","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Poro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foune ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nomi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima Brouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":370000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":370000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":370000,"processed_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":381014.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917848,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-08T16:13:38Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215878,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou F. is from the village of  Blanco , Balingsag Misamis  Oriental.

After the death of her husband, she found herself alone and responsible for two children. So she decided to take charge of the operation of her husband's mini-market. She has been working hard to pay her family's expenses. She offers all types of products: food products, cereals, soft drinks, detergents, etc. The mini-market has been established for almost sixteen years and it is known by a good number of clients. She is requesting to borrow $1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to increase her store\u2019s inventory. She hopes that the variety of products presented to her clients will continue to earn profit for her family.\r\n\r\nIt is very common in Lebanon to find small supermarkets, selling both perishable and non-perishable goods. As members of the communities themselves, store owners have a deep understanding of local consumer needs and can offer products that meet local demands. The strong network of community relationships are an important component of life in Lebanon, especially in smaller towns and villages.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese micro-finance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Richard Lawrence is a teacher and he has been teaching in Kayunga for the last fifteen years. Because of his vast teaching experience, he has enjoyed a reputable status in the numerous schools he teaches in.\r\n\r\nWhat has made Richard successful in his profession is the fact that he researches a lot and he emphasizes a practical approach in whatever he teaches. He mainly teaches sciences. To all appearances, he is a jolly and friendly gentleman and this is an attribute that most of his students have come to cherish.\r\n\r\nThe teaching profession has often been cited as one of the lowest paying professions in the country, with teachers earning in the paltry range of 150,000 to 200,000 shillings.

He has owned a furniture painting shop for the past 27 years. He has a lot of experience in this occupation. He paints all types of furniture. \r\n\r\nHe is the main provider and he works hard to satisfy the demands of his family and its heavy expenses. He cooperates with some galleries and makes paintings for their furniture and he gains his own profit from it, in addition to painting used furniture upon the request of clients.\r\n\r\nHe is thankful for his business income over the years. And in order to continue expanding his business, he is requesting to borrow $1,000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy a new painting compressor. And with the help of the loan, he will be able to take more project orders. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<\/b>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Kiva borrower is a 24-year-old single man living with his family and four siblings. He has run a successful bakery for over five years and his freshly prepared goods are enjoyed by members of his village and neighboring towns. He prepares delicious Lebanese breads and other products.\r\n\r\nLike the majority of the Lebanese community, he cooperates with his father and brothers to assure the needs of the family. With his loan of USD 1,200 requested from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l., he will purchase flour so as to be prepared for the coming holidays in Lebanon and for the summer season. During this time, there are a lot of ceremonies like weddings and special events and the customers will be asking for his products.\r\n\r\nHe is certain that, with the help of the loan, his sales will increase and so will his income.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note:<\/b> Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (e.g. blanking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<\/b>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese micro-finance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in micro-finance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loan from Kiva to offer lower interest loans with faster disbursement to its micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling US$115 million.

In the future, he wants to have a better-equipped workshop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Michael Briggs, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":570919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Buy gas cylinders for welding","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"SEME-PODJI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.383333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-07-19T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Comlan Gratien ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8466.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954813,"comment":null},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8466.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056468,"comment":null},{"amount":17.07,"local_amount":8533.34,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8670.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177348003,"comment":null},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182483029,"comment":null},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617845,"comment":null},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361215,"comment":null},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779908,"comment":null},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401709,"comment":null},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206089387,"comment":null},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8534.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211160247,"comment":null},{"amount":32,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":16256.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216443466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-19T18:47:55Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:29:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215933,"name":"Andaluz Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C.

T. because she is one of the group members.  She\u2019s 34 years old, married and has two children: Linda Mar\u00eda, 9, and Jos\u00e9, 8. Both are in elementary school.  She sells fast-food snacks like enchiladas and sopes (fried masa rounds topped with beans, meat, cheese, shredded lettuce, salsa, sour cream).  She also sells hand-made tortillas.  She has been in business for over 14 years.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda chose to sell fast-food snacks because it\u2019s what she knows how to do best because her older sister taught her to cook.  She says it\u2019s also a very good source of income and it helps her support the family.  She will use the funds to buy ingredients that she uses to prepare her food like:  firewood, corn, potatoes, Poblano (Ancho) chilies, green chilies, green and red tomatoes, onions, garlic and other spices.\r\n\r\nHer business has been of much utility for her because now that her children are about to return to school she has to buy them shoes, backpacks, school uniforms and supplies in addition to the monetary contributions she must give at the beginning of the school year.  She also wants to improve her business enlarging the place where she sells her snacks.\r\n\r\nHer business is also of use to the people living in her community because they don\u2019t have to travel so far to get food and tortillas since some of the area residents prefer to buy prepared food so as not to have to cook at home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wants her children to have professions since she did not have the opportunity to go to school.  She is thinking that besides selling food she can also sell fruits and vegetables since she says it is also a good business that produces excellent profits.\r\n\r\nShe mentions to us that her group works together very well because all the members know each other and are very responsible with their payments.\r\n\r\nThese are the names of the other members with the activities each is involved with:\r\n\r\nDaniel Abraham M.

Virginia In\u00e9s is a candy vendor at an elementary school near her house and she also sells candy at her house.\r\n\r\nShe chose this activity because being a single mother she had to find a way to support her children so she began with this small business.

They decided to give it that name because that is the name of the neighborhood they live in and also because they are very united women.  This story is about Mrs.Marisela L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez, who is a part of this group. She is married and has two children, a 3 year old son and a 9 year old girl. Her daughter goes to elementary school and Marisela has been selling handmade tortillas for a year. \r\n \r\nMarisela decided to start this business out of neccesity. She wasn't financially stable enough to educate her 2 children. She decided to invest the loan in purchasing more ingredients for the torilla preparation, such as: corn and firewood, which are the most indispensable things.  \r\n \r\nHer business is benefitting her a lot since with her earnings she is able to pay for her children's education. She is also saving up to invest in a locale to be able to open a tortilla shop and provide work for the people in her community.    \r\n \r\nShe wants to keep investing in the business to open her tortilla shop and she also wants to keep supporting her children so that they can keep going to school and finish their studies and have a better future. \r\n \r\nShe remarks that all of her fellow members are responsible people who make their payments. They all know each other and have no problems among themselves.

This is her second loan from our institution.  Celia lives in the Cafetal neighborhood in the Dorado area, where she has her own home where she lives with her husband and their 4 children.  She sells breakfasts and lunches, and as a second activity she also has a jukebox, so that while her customers enjoy their delicious lunch they can also listen to good music.  The money she requests will be used to increase her capital for her business selling food, for which she has a lot of demand.  She has a goal of eventually renting out rooms in her house, but she currently lacks the infrastructure for this.  In addition, she wants to buy more tables and chairs; part of the money will be used to do this.  \"I am grateful to the institution for the confidence it is placing in me,\" she says.\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":571081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to increase working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-07-22T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":65.61},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":73.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":79.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.61},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":64.34,"local_amount":64.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":64.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159620219,"comment":null},{"amount":65.61,"local_amount":65.61,"processed_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":65.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834652,"comment":null},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":68.23,"processed_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":68.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172101027,"comment":null},{"amount":71.33,"local_amount":71.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177393799,"comment":null},{"amount":73.78,"local_amount":73.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":73.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182532211,"comment":null},{"amount":76.92,"local_amount":76.92,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":76.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668773,"comment":null},{"amount":79.79,"local_amount":79.79,"processed_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":79.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191412213,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-22T19:10:41Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:59:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215994,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Rodolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJos\u00e9 es un padre de familia de 33 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposa y su hijo en casa de su madre, ubicada en el sector La Holler\u00eda, una de las tantas zonas rurales que conforman el distrito de M\u00f3rrope, distrito perteneciente a la provincia de Lambayeque que se encuentra situado a una hora de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSu profesi\u00f3n original es la de alfarero, confecciona ollas y vasijas de barro en su casa a pedido de un intermediario que viene a recoger sus productos eventualmente.

The house is located in the La Holleria sector, one of many rural areas of the Morrope district of the Lambayeque Province, one hour from the town of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe is a potter by trade, crafting clay pots and pans by request of a middle man who comes to take his products every now and then. With money he had saved he opened a general store in his home. That is where he and his wife attend their customers and offer them basic good for which they would otherwise have to travel to the central village (20 minutes away) to get. \r\n\r\nHe also has a construction job but just as with his pottery job, it is not a permanent position. Because of that, Jose strives as best he can to move ahead with his business. Currently he wishes to expand it by buying more inventory and has requested Edpyme Alternative a loan for 1,500 nuevos soles. \r\n\r\nJose has worked before with Kiva and with our bank. Thanks to his previous loan he was able to supply his general store with inventory and increase his income. He is thankful to the people who supported him the first time and wishes to keep working to accomplish his goals and move ahead. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":470836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of basic goods to expand general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo La Holleria - C.

It is located in the Hueyapan community, Tetela del Volcan, in the state of Morelos.  The group is comprised of four members who are neighbors and know each other.  This is their first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\n\r\nCelia M. F. is the group\u2019s representative.  She is 43 years old, and she has a sixth grade education.  She has three children, one boy and two girls.  Eudocio is 28 years old and works in the United States.  Miriam is 20 years old.  Herminia is 16 years old, and she just finished high school.\r\n\r\nCelia sells soft drinks and \u201cchicharrones\u201d (fried pork rinds) in her house in Rancho Los Tejocotes.  Her house is one of the last houses on the hill.  She requested her loan to buy cases of soft drinks; the brands Jarrito and Red Cola in the two liter size; oil, sugar, and chicarrones.  She says that she started her business two years ago.  Her son that is in the United States sent her money, and she decided to buy soft drinks and chicarrones in order to start selling.\r\n\r\nHer customers are her neighbors.  When they go to work in the fields they pass by and purchase soft drinks or chicharrones.  Her daughters help her with the business because they realize it is important.  That is where they get income for food and the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy with the loan she was given.  She expects to see her business bigger and better stocked.  \r\n\r\nIn her community of Hueyapan there is a lot of vegetation and pine trees.  There are also fruit trees like pear, apple, peach, cherry, and \u201ctejocote\u201d (Mexican hawthorn).  The climate is mild, and there are also animals. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\n*Herlinda P. A.:  Will buy cherry, peach, and apple plants to plant\r\n*Yolanda A.

It is in the community of Axochiapan in the Mexican state of Morelos.  It has 7 members who know each other well because they are all neighbors.  This is their second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Florencia V. S., 51.  She finished 7th grade and has a total of 5 children, 3 boys and 2 girls.  Deyser is 29, Herick is 24, Efrain is 12 and in school, Vianey is 30 and Yussell is 26.\r\n\r\nFlorencia has a business where she sells decorative metal work.  She sells doors, windows, display cases, glass and aquariums.  She requested funds to buy aluminum frames.\r\n\r\nFlorencia started her business 25 years ago.  They lived in Mexico City and a young man from there became associated with her husband and taught him how to do this kind of work in aluminum.  Prior to having this business she only sold glass in Mexico City.  She saved up and gradually purchased merchandise and, with what this young man taught them, they were able to expand their glass business to include aluminum iron work.  Now, they tend to their business from their home in Axochiapan and it\u2019s important for them because it is their future.  They earn income for the future and income from the business has provided for the education of their children and she hopes will continue to provide for the education of her youngest who still is in school.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most is seeing the finished work, the windows, doors and display cases.  She remembers that when her children started to learn the business they liked it too.  One of them even has his own similar business.  Customers from Axochipan and surrounding areas come to her store.  \r\nAxochiapan is a very tranquil place that has all necessary services. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are: Ana Lidia C. R., who will buy women and men\u2019s shoes.  Susana Dias B. who will buy merchandise like tomatoes, chilies, beans, hibiscus flowers, corn, etc.  Agnelica L. H. who will buy soft-drinks at wholesale and by the case.  Aquilina A. A. who will buy vegetables like corn to make masa, disposable dishes and drinking glasses, soft drinks, cream cheese, chilies, tomatoes, etc. for her snack business.  Blanca C.

Quinones will buy flour and sugar in bulk as well as bread baskets.\r\n\r\nFlorencia V.

It is located in the village of Jaloxtoc, in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  The group is made up of 5 members who know each other because they are neighbors.  This is their first loan with Fundacion Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe member Monica B. J. is 30, and went to school through the sixth grade.  She has 2 sons, Juan Antonio, 12, and Cristhian Jesus, 8.  Monica sells perfumes and cosmetics through a catalog of the  \u201cJafra\u201d brand.  She needs the loan to buy perfumes, lipsticks, eye shadows and  cosmetics from Jafra.  She started her business 4 years ago when she was given a flyer to come to a talk and she thought this business was a good idea because she would have time to take care of her children, especially the youngest.    He is handicapped.  He can\u2019t speak and he is slow physically so they go for therapy in the city of Cuatla.   Her business is important because it is what supports the family and she puts a lot of energy into it so that sales don\u2019t fall off.  She will use the earnings to pay off the loan and for her son\u2019s therapy and for her since she has to pay  for each session and for the transportation to Cuatla from her home. \u201c To have a handicapped child is to live life differently from other people,\u201d says Monica.\r\n\r\nHer business has competition from others who sell the same products.  Her dream is to set up her own stand so that she doesn\u2019t have to sell from house to house.  In the village of Jaloxtoc the countryside is beautiful.  There are 2 jagueys (trees).  The village feast is the 8th of December honoring Santa Maria and there is a Mass on that day, mariachis, and food for all the people who attend.\r\n\r\nThe other people of the group are:\r\nMaria de Lourdes M. B. who is going to buy  perfumes for woman and cologne for men, lipsticks and eye shadows to supply her business.\r\nSabina H. M. who will buy sugar, straws, bags, flavorings and fruit, etc to make ice cream popsicles.\r\nRufina R. Canutova who will buy shoes to start a business.\r\nChristina C. B. who will buy vegetables and fruit to increase her business.\r\n\r\nMonica says \u201cthanks for trusting in me, for offering me help and I promise not to be dishonest, and to continue getting ahead.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":570977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy perfumes and cometics from Jafra.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JALOXTOC, AYALA;

K. is 43 and married with 5 children.

She plans to use the earnings (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Malama joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Malama's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

V. is 73 and married with 9 children (ages 34 - 48). She sells taro, which she plants and harvests. Sipaepae has many years of experience in this business.  Sipaepae requests a loan of WST$1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the earnings (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Sipaepae joined SPBD. This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sipaepae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

J. is 58 and married with 5 children. She sells taro, which she plants and harvests. Aufaatasi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Aufaatasi needs a loan of WST$2000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. She plans to use the earnings (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Aufaatasi joined SPBD. This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Aufaatasi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

P. is 22 and single with no children.  She sells bananas, which she plants and harvests.  Jacinta has 1 year of experience in this business.  Jacinta requests a loan of WST$1000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the earnings (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jacinta joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Jacinta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.
