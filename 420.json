according to his own scope of interest, skills, whims and desires. The most important thing is not to slack off and be lazy. For hardworking, ambitious people there are lots of opportunities waiting for them. One has to just see it and grab it outright. This is the distinguishing trait of a successful individual: to see the chance and do his best to use it. And chances and opportunities are always there. Nurgul A. is the leader of this group. She is 42 and has three children. Her husband is a builder. To make a living, Nurgul also works.  She is a saleswoman. She trades in meat. She started working after her husband had gone to Russia to work. She needed money and instead of asking her relatives for help, decided to try being a seller and it did work out. Now, her work allows her to not only meet her family\u2019s daily needs but also pay for her daughter\u2019s education. Nurgul has applied for this loan to buy five sheep for feeding and resale. \r\n\r\nNurgul\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nMirlan T., 23, is single. He has decided to start his own business breeding cattle. He hopes to obtain this loan to buy cattle. Mirlan plans to do this business together with his wife.\r\n\r\nNargiza A., 24, is single. She trades in vegetables and fruits.

His wife works as a cook. As to Nurlanbek, he is engaged in raising cattle. Nurlanbek needs this loan to pay for sowing and tractor services. \r\n\r\nAida A., 31, has two children and works as a saleswoman. Her husband is a builder.

However, we are not able to see the daily struggle of these people to earn their daily bread. Behind their usual expressions is hidden spiritual strength \u2013 determination to survive and achieve success in life. \r\n\r\nThe heroes of our story are ordinary people but, given their mindsets and views, these people deserve special consideration. Gulziya U. is the leader of this group. She is 57 and has raised four children. Her husband works as a school teacher. Gulziya is also a school teacher but, besides that, she works in cattle breeding. Gulziya has long experience in raising cattle (12 years) and therefore does not have any difficulties in combining the two jobs. On the contrary, she is eager to work even harder as there are many things to be done. \r\n\r\nGulziya always strives to improve her family\u2019s living conditions. As soon as they obtained a piece of land from the state, she did not think twice and quickly started keeping cattle. After fattening the cattle, she is reselling them and buying more. Now her joint monthly income comes to around $211. Considering her initial investment of $45, she is doing pretty well! Gulziya hopes to obtain this loan to purchase fuel and sugar for making jam. Gulziya has many plans for the future. Very soon, she is going to make a grand repair of her house. \r\n\r\nGulziya's partners: \r\n\r\nSaltanat A., 31, has two children. Her husband is occupied with farming and Saltanat sells vegetables and fruits. She needs a loan to pay for hay-cutting and tractor services. \r\n\r\nMunara J., 44, is the mother of three children. Her husband is a farmer. Munara works as a school teacher and is also engaged in farming. Munara needs this loan to purchase cattle for breeding. \r\n\r\nMira B., 34, has two children. Together with her husband, she works at a gas station as an operator. Mira has applied for this loan to buy metal roofing for her house.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

Arnold has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arnold joined HSPFI to gain much-needed access to financial services. In turn, he was able to to engage in business activities and to thereby improve his standard of living. Notably, Arnold has already successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide his services. Arnold is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 8,000 PHP ($175), which will be used to purchase additional materials needed to provide his services.

They also guarantee each other's loans, therefore he can easily get a loan from Faulu Kenya.  He previously serviced two loans through the group. This has helped him invest in his business, hence raising his living standards.  He has requested for a loan of 50,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to add stocks of sugar, cooking fat, soaps and sweets.

Mabinuligon, Brgy. Maquiling, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and standing cane businesses.  Her husband Crispin, who is 74 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and he also helps his wife.  They have seven children who are 28 to 50 years old. \r\n\r\nAmparo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amparo has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy standing cane and stocks for her general store so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and to expand her standing cane business.  Amparo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Siporah is a farmer and she does the farming on her own piece of land which she has been doing for the last seven years.\r\n\r\nShe learned about KADET from other women in a group already registered with KADET.

She earns her living by operating a general store and pig fattening business. Her husband Federico D., who is 48 years old, works as a carpenter and farmer to earn his living.  He also helps in his wife.  They have four children who are 17 to  21 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Elena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past seven cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy piglets and for additional capital so she can continue to save up for the future education of children.  Ma. Elena D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

He is married to Sereya K. and a father of two school-going children. Longisa is a farmer and he has been doing farming for the last ten years and later selling his produce at a profit.\r\n\r\nHe learned about KADET from a friend who is a registered client of KADET in his area of residence.

Sylivia is not part of the group photo but her small photo appears in the top left corner of the main picture and she is the person that was interviewed.\r\n\r\nN. Sylivia, a 35-year-old happily married mother of three, has been plying her retail shop business for the last four years in Wabigalo, Mityana. In a cutthroat competitive business like retail, one needs to conjure up ways and means and also one needs to strike a profound first impression with customers to get a niche in the market. Sylvia has used her good customer care skills as her business stock-in-trade.\r\n\r\nLong before Sylivia drew up plans of establishing this business, she was more inclined to a commercial agricultural business. In the course of time, she wanted to emulate the successful businesswomen her village had produced.

N. M. is thirty one years old, married and has two children, ages five years old and four months. \r\n\r\nHe sells clothes, shoes and handbags to local people.

She lives in Purok 2, Brgy.

She now earns an average income of PHP10,000.  \r\n\r\nHelen is now borrowing PHP 18,500 for the renovation of her pump boat.  This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Helen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

years old and is married to Mr. Ronal Ortiz.  They have three children, ages 7, 5, and 3.  She lives in the community of Sumunpaya, in Colcapirhua, in the Department of Cochabamba.  She works in the production of milk and fresh cheese.\r\n\r\nBenedicta is a very hard-working person.  Two months ago, she had an operation for varicose veins because she could not walk, as it affected her feet.  Her husband, Ronal, decided it was at the point where she needed to have the operation so that she could get better, to care for their children and to guide their education.  However, their milk and cheese production has really fallen during her recovery, because her husband has another job and can't dedicate himself to their dairy business.  Benedicta has done the best she can, with the help of her son.\r\n\r\nNow that she is able to work more, Benedicta is requesting this loan to buy soybean husk to feed her cows.  If she provides the cows with nutritional food, they will produce more milk and she can increase her income.  This would allow her to help with the household expenses and to pay for her children's education.  She dreams that her children will have a better future, be able to finish high school, and become professionals.  Benedicta imagines that her daughter would make an excellent doctor, and in this way could help low-income people, especially the children of their community.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

Jesica from Kakinga, Ibanda district.\n\nThis married lady has subsisted on growing a variety of agricultural products for the last ten years. Though adverse weather conditions have constantly affected her gardens, Jesica has managed to consolidate the gains she has made. As a result, her family of four children has enjoyed the benefits. Principally, her children all now attend good institutions of learning.\n\nIn a month, Jesica reveals that she makes close to, or even more than, 200,000 Ugandan shillings from selling her farm produce, depending on the season. She is very upbeat that, with this loan, she will be in a position to improve on the mulching and gardening aspects of her farm and also increase the stock of animals on her farm which will help her increase her productivity.\n\nIn the photo, the lady with the hand up is Jesica K. and the man standing with the hand raised is one of the executive members of Karambi Tutungukye group.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3950,"image":{"id":559824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase mulches for her farm and increase her stock of animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-23T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Denis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fuderi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brighton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frank","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Gideon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Vangi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8900000,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1483333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1483333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1483333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1483333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1483333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1483333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":658.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":658.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":658.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":658.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":658.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":658.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":573.27,"local_amount":1291668,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1294153.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689415,"comment":null},{"amount":565.65,"local_amount":1274497,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1276949.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903564,"comment":null},{"amount":853.95,"local_amount":1924101,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1927803.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297037,"comment":null},{"amount":618.04,"local_amount":1392536,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1395215.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467311,"comment":null},{"amount":702.98,"local_amount":1583930,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1586977.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605450,"comment":null},{"amount":636.11,"local_amount":1433268,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1436025.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744629,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-26T09:57:37Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":210604,"name":"Siama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Siama C. is currently in the business of selling bags of charcoal out of her home  and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of charcaol to sell.

M. is a widow who lives in the Golden Rosary zone of Jonobjonob village, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. \r\n\r\nVeneranda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Veneranda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000 - uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store, so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Veneranda M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":559572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

I. is a married woman who lives in Tuburan village, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two businesses: pottery and passenger transport businesses. Her husband Danilo I., who is 55 years old, works as a driver and pottery maker to earn his living, helping with his wife's business activities. They have two children who are eight and 11 years old. \r\n\r\nCynthia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cynthia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000 - uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy materials for pottery making so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nCynthia I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

H. is a married woman who lives in the Santol zone of Jonobjonob village, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Ronnie, who is 43 years old, works as an auxiliary to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have one child who is six years old. \r\n\r\nDeodima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Deodima has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,500 - uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store, so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nDeodima H. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He has been taking care of his family since then. \r\n\r\nCiprian T. P. is a young man who is very devoted to his work.  He has a small plot of farmland in the Palmeras neighborhood.

She lives in the Sambag zone of Jonobjonob village, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. \n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her livestock trading and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 4,000 per month.\n\nLenatte is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can buy more livestock. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lenatte aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF:  \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

M. is a widow who lives in Prk. Santol, Brgy. Jonobjonob, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store and buy and sell (bananaque) businesses. \r\n\r\nViriginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Viriginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,700!\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to buy more stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and expansion of her business.  Viriginia M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her children are her primary motivation for all of her efforts.\r\n\r\nRobila farms potatoes and peas everyday.  Through much effort she has made her land very productive.  This has generated very good quality crops, and they are very much valued in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is taking care of her crops.  She has been doing this activity for 18 years.  The most difficult part is transporting her products to the wholesale market in the city.  The sacks that she takes are very heavy, which is exhausting to her.  Later, she wishes to have a stand in the wholesale market in order to improve her earnings.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  She plans on being very punctual with her payments as she does not want to cause problems in her communal bank.  She is very happy in her communal bank.  She will use the 2,000 PEN that she is requesting to buy pea seeds.  This vegetable plant is selling very well in these months.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":560019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy pea seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2050.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326855,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T18:43:41Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":210634,"name":"Marie Claire","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie Claire is 30 years old, married with 4 children.

She is a mother and has a very simple, hard-working family.  She lives in her own house with her husband Serapio, 55, and their 5 young children, to whom they want to give a better education. \r\n\r\nPilar has put a lot of effort into making her farm very productive.  She grows potatoes, a product that is in high demand in the Tarma wholesale market, where she sells them.  Her crops have given her the income necessary to provide for her family.  For this reason  she puts all of her effort into getting ahead in this business.  She has been working her farm for 38 years and what she likes most about her job is caring for her crops once they are planted.  However, her crops require a lot of care to keep pests from attacking them.  Also, the variation in climate affects production, but she is confident that everything will turn out well.  Transporting her produce to the market is also difficult for her because it is very heavy.

They decided to request a loan from ASDIR in order to be able to improve their living conditions and those of their families, since they are women of limited resources and this is a great help for them to expand their business capital and improve their sales and their earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":560057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2010-06-25T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Clara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Alvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rogelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina Elisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesi Batsab\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wendy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Toribia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":379.17,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159591376,"comment":null},{"amount":379.16,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166802420,"comment":null},{"amount":379.17,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172072441,"comment":null},{"amount":379.17,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177363945,"comment":null},{"amount":379.16,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-01T08:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182499060,"comment":null},{"amount":379.17,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188634665,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-25T22:00:13Z","paid_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":210661,"name":"Zansi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Z.

Zansi is a widowed mother of three children, all in school, of whom two are still in her care. Zansi lives with her two children in the Agbodj\u00e8do area in Cotonou. She provides for the family by herself. Zansi never went to school. To meet her various needs, she runs a business selling maize, as well as shrimp, at her home. As a secondary business, Zansi prepares and sells akassa ( a local food made from cornstarch). She gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market in Benin.

He currently owns his own land where he grows potatoes.  He looks forward to this work since he supports himself this way.  He has been doing this for 6 years.  He enjoys taking care of the crops the most.  Nevertheless it is diffictult taking the harvest to the market since it is very heavy and he must load various sacks.  He biggest wish is to buy new land in order to increase production.  This is his second loan with MFP.  He knows he must pay all his payments on time and he is prepared to do it.  He doesn\u2019t want to get his communal group into trouble.  He is a very caring and responsible co-worker.

She lives in a traditional family with her husband, her children, and several households in the Sokala neighborhood of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\nShe never went to school due to the refusal of her parents, who felt that school was the road perdition for the girl. She started early on to work with her mother selling cotton clothes. After several years at her mother\u2019s side, she was able to master the mechanics of the business. She started running her own shop selling fruit juice and ice. She has been doing this for 17 years and enjoys great reputation and recognition. She is constantly getting orders for important ceremonies (weddings, baptisms, deaths, etc.).\r\nShe makes her juices using sugar, ginger, tomi (very popular exotic fruit), and packets of vanilla sugar and juice powders (banana and orange). Everything is mixed into three liters of water to achieve the desired flavor. The beverage is then poured in thoroughly washed drums and placed in the refrigerator to chill. \r\nIn order to get a new refrigerator to meet customer demand, she is seeking a new loan with Soro Yiriwaso. She has been associated with the organization for four years, and has already received four group loans and two individual loans, all repaid without incident.\r\nThis will be her third individual loan, which she plans to use to buy a new refrigerator. She can acquire the equipment locally. \r\nMrs. Fatoumata A. sells cash or credit to a clientele consisting of both men and women. \r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA, which will be used to repay the loan and pay her electricity bills.\r\nHer goal is to expand her business and train her grandchildren in this industry.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

She has already obtained two loans through ALID\u00c9 (one of Kiva's field partners), both of which were repaid properly, but with some difficulty because she was sick.

She lives with her husband and their three children in their own home. For more than 18 years she has knitted sweaters that are exported out of the country. She has been knitting her whole life and does it mostly during the early mornings, when she concentrates on making her stitches and lets her imagination help her make the most beautiful designs and forms. After a painstaking review by the company that purchases her merchandise, Rosa has been recognized for the hue and quality of her items. The chair covered with blankets in the photo is where Rosa knits nonstop. She enjoys her work, although lately she has had some problems with her eye sight, which is why in the future she plans to renew her business of selling nutritional products, which she had done to earn additional income.

They work mostly in selling cleaning products, clothing, jams, and custards (flan), hats, food, French fries, typical fried pastries, dressmaking and hairstyling.  The member who was interviewed is Katherine, the education delegate.  In the photo she is in the second row, shown standing second, going from left to right, and she\u2019s wearing a blue sweater. She sells chocolate products, mostly candies and cuchiflis (bars filled with caramelized sweetened condensed milk).  She sells her products in stores and child care centers and has been working in this business for 4 years. She is a beautician and she also does relaxation therapy, shiatsu, and manicures in people\u2019s homes.  Also when she is faced with times of economic crises, she borrows her mother's sewing machine and makes jerseys for a school.  She will use the loan to buy the caramelized milk spread, chocolates, cookies to make the typical candies, and plastic sticks to make chocolate bars.  Her goal is to sell only by the box, because now she sells mostly individually.  Her biggest dream is to have a costume store.\r\n\r\n  Katherine\u2019s motivation for all this is her 2 children, 12 and 5, and her husband, who has been a basic support for her.  What she most likes about participating with Fondo Esperanza is that she has been able to become motivated and appreciate her business more.  She does this knowing that she can continue receiving loans if she is responsible, something that she is always working to achieve.  La Florida is a community located in the southeast of Santiago, the capital of Chile.  Its current population has all economic levels that are found in the metropolitan area: upper, upper middle, middle, and lower middle classes.  The area has modern commercial centers and is a growing community.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She lives with her husband and 2 children in their own house. \r\n\r\nFor the last 7 years her work has been selling chickens. Since then her work has started at 6:00 A.M when she picks up the chickens, in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of her clients, such as owners of restaurants where they sell roasted chicken. These owners place the largest orders for this perishable product, along with housewives.\r\n\r\nSome years back Ysa worked alone, but today she employs one person who is paid daily and helps her serve the clients.  She works from very early until 3:00 P.M in the afternoon at her sales location which is located two blocks from the main market. She feels very pleased with her work which provides her with income. Her greatest wish is to have a location insiD. the market. \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth credit with MFP and she knows that this loan will be very important to her in order to increase the working capital of her business.

Sometimes even a big purchase does not make us feel good whereas some slight help can make us very happy. We never know what feelings this or that occasion will inspire in us, but one thing is true: that regardless of the sum of money a person obtains as help, if it is done in time of need and difficulty, it certainly brightens his day and makes him feel that the world is not that bad, that there are many good and generous people out there, making him wish to become one of them in future.\r\n\r\nAltyngul T. is forty five and is the mother of four children. To provide for the family Altyngul\u2019s husband works as a taxi driver. Altyngul also prefers to be occupied with something, so, using her skill of cooking delicious food, she has been cooking meals for sale in a small caf\u00e9. The meals she makes range from traditional to European and Oriental kitchens.\r\n\r\nDuring the past several years, Altyngul and her husband have worked hard and managed to buy a car and furnish their special kitchen\/caf\u00e9, where Altyngul works. Now her monthly income is around 220 USD.\r\n\r\nAltyngul has raised good children: her eldest daughter is married while her two sons are helping her fetch the foodstuffs and prepare ingredients. Her little son goes to middle school.\r\n\r\nAltyngul has decided to apply for this loan as she needs money to buy flour, meat, sugar, olive oil and many other things needed for cooking. She knows that her business will grow even faster if she can invest in it a significant amount of funds to improve the design and interiors.\r\n\r\nAltyngul\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nAijamal S., 31, is divorced and has an eight-year-old daughter. To provide for her small family she works as a bartender in a caf\u00e9.

The older son provides tractor services and earns 10,000 soms (approximately 217 USD) per month and the other children are students.

Pangasian Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgie P. is from the village of Lower Puntod. She is 30 years-old and she is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by Kiva partner PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVirgie is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Virgie owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Virgie has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Virgie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virgie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Virgie is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Virgie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":559664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jeni joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to to purchase additional products to sell and is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Jeni from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She sells clothes to women and primary school children at a small market in a residential area. One disadvantage is that it is not easy to attract new customers at her current location.\r\n\r\nShe has been in this business for ten years and has two employees. Berigita is married and has four children, two sons and two daughters. \r\n\r\nBerigita plans to use the 50,000 KES loan to purchase more fabric at lower prices for ladies' dresses.

Because he is thrifty and was able to save money, he became owner of the motorcycle which he had borrowed.  He has been a client of ACB since June of 2008, and has already repaid a loan.  He has requested this loan to pay the tuition of his wife, who is in her second year at university. In the future, he plans to sit for the test to obtain a Category D drivers license for a minibus taxi, then borrow enough to purchase a minibus which he would operate himself.  Long term, this would enable him to increase his income and become financially independent.

In the future, he wants to be a good administrator in Rwanda, climbing from class to completing college. His family will benefit because he will find a new job other than a watchman\/securityman.

O. is from the village of Lagonglong, Misamis Oriental. She is 56 years old. Dorotia is married and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Dorotia owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from the buying and selling of banana products in the local community. Dorotia has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Dorotia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dorotia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Dorotia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Dorotia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is from the village of Lagonglong, Misamis Oriental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products in the local community. Minda has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Minda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Minda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Minda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Minda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, Cinderella owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Cinderella has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cinderella joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cinderella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Cinderella is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Cinderella from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

F. is from the village of Kinoguitan, Misamis Oriental. She is 45 years-old and married with eight adult children.  To make a living, Emma owns and operates a business in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling food and daily use products in the local community. Emma has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Emma joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Emma is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Emma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":560582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Two of her children have been to high school.  \r\n\r\nThis is a family that lives from agriculture and raising cattle.  They have a good location near Kivu lake where there is always pasture even during the dry season.  Mrs. M. received a loan from Amasezerano Community Banking in 2009 to buy a cow of a better breed.  Thanks to her investment, she has paid the tuition fees for her two children and put flooring in her house, which had a dirt floor before.  She hopes to acquire 10 better breed cows in the future because these are more profitable than local cows and produce milk, which improves nutrition.   The return on this investment will allow her to support the other two children who are still in school.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eileen Jessop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":560598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a breeding cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Rubavu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-26T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41667},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41663}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":41667,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":42364.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151836789,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":83334,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":84729.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788089,"comment":null},{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":41667,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42364.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172057558,"comment":null},{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":41667,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42364.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177348852,"comment":null},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":41667,"processed_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42364.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182483845,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":249998,"processed_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":254185.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188618623,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T06:33:32Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T11:58:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211016,"name":"Urbana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Urbana S. is from the village of Talakag, Bukidnon.

A. is from the village of Balingasag, Misamis Oriental. She is 48 years old, is separated from her spouse and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Sherlita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Sherlita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sherlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sherlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nSherlita is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This loan will be the second loan taken out by Sherlita from HSPFI.
