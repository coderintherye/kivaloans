She and her husband have helped each other to overcome the poverty that impeded their family. \r\n<br>In 1997, Rufina joined Kiva partner, ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI in the Philippines, in order to acquire capital for her fishing business and embark on her bamboo set (furniture) making business. As a member of ASHI for almost 13 years, she has a remarkably good performance in her credit rating and is therefore being trusted by ASHI to obtain larger loans. \r\n<br>This loan is her fourteenth \u2013 she has made good use of her previous loans to expand her business and income. Rufina has applied for a new loan of 35,000 PHP to buy fishing nets, bamboo, rope, fish traps, and other supplies. The remaining money will be used in her bamboo set making business.\r\n<br>Rufina dreams of expanding her business into a fully-fledged fish farm. She also dreams of sending her grandchildren to school until they finish college and find good jobs. Until that dreams happens, she is happy with the way in which ASHI and Kiva have changed her family's life and given them a good possibility of making their dreams come true. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASHI<\/b><br>\r\nAhon sa Hirap, Inc., or ASHI, has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen methodology to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines. ASHI, as the first practitioner in the field, saw how poor women and mothers work hard to earn money for their family and provide their children with a better life. Since the microcredit ASHI is extending to these women is delivered directly in their villages on the doorsteps of their houses, these loans give the hope that someday they will \u201crise above poverty\u201d (the English translation of 'Ahon Sa Hirap').\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":508001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

R., 44, is making sure that her family has enough provision for their daily needs. Married to Geraldo R., a tricycle driver, she is blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been a tricycle operator for quite some time now.\r\n<br>Lennie has been a regular member of Kiva partner, Center for Community Transformation (CCT), for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she is now able to borrow quite a few times more from CCT\u2019s cooperative. Lennie is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her tricycle business. \r\n<br>Now, with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of 10,000 PHP. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying new tires and paying for a tune-up for the tricycle.

This group is led by Oktofianus J., who is 30 years old. Oktofianus was born to a farming family. He is married and has been blessed with a cute daughter, Nadia, who is 3 years old. Oktofianus only has secondary education as his childhood was mostly spent on the farm rather than at school. He loves farming.\r\n\r\nOktofianus and his family live in a modest house. As a farmer, he relies on agriculture for income to meet his family's needs. He plants vegetables, tomatoes, chilies, bananas and coconuts on the farm. According to Oktofianus, vegetables and tomatoes are the most important agricultural products that he harvests and sells to traders. He works on the farm from 6 am to 4 pm every day. As the breadwinner, Oktofianus has to work hard to generate more income to provide his family, especially his daughter, with sufficient and nutritious food. \r\n\r\nOktofianus says that he doesn\u2019t have to sell his agricultural products at the market since his customers come to buy directly from him. His customers mostly come from Inpres Market which is situated about 37 km from Bone Village. They usually come to buy his crops every two weeks. The income that he generates is unstable. He can generate up to 600,000 Indonesian rupiah (IDR) over a two week period. \r\n\r\nOktofianus has a goal to improve his family's standard of living, but he only has limited skills. He faces difficulties in meeting his family\u2019s daily needs as food and other necessities are quite expensive at the market. This situation drives him to find other ways to better meet his family's needs.  Recently he heard information about the TLM Cattle Fattening Program that assists poor farmers like him. He is interested in joining the program as he has fertile land where the grass grows well for cattle food.\r\n\r\nOktofianus is requesting a loan of 3,200,000 IDR to buy a young cow to be fattened over a 12 month period. Just like Oktofianus, the other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle so they can improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nNote: Melkianus and Lodia were replaced by their family members when the group picture was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":508032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T00:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oktofianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selfiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melkianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yakoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lebrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":28800000,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":28800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3150,"local_amount":28800000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":28869750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195922583,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T18:57:39Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185567,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita M. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kuanputun B is a group of eight members in Bone Village \u2013 Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. It is situated about a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Kupang City. The community supports their family needs by farming and selling the agricultural products in the market.\r\n\r\nThis group is led by Natalia J., a 24-year-old lady. She was born and grew up in Bone Village. Because her parents are poor, Natalia only has a secondary education. She lives with her parents in a modest house. Natalia has two brothers and one sister: Antonius J., who is in Elementary School Grade 5; Bartasar, who is in Elementary School Grade 3; and Margarita, who is not at school yet. Her family relies on the agriculture sector to meet their daily needs. \r\n\r\nAs the eldest child, Natalia usually helps her father on the farm as her mother is recently unwell and her siblings are still too young to help her father on the farm. Natalia is a diligent girl; she usually spends her day on the farm, helping her father from 11 a.m. up to 4 p.m. Natalia and her father plant vegetables, cassavas, tomatoes and then water the coconut and banana trees. She also cuts dried leaves to make the plants grow well. She usually sells the agricultural products in the Inpres Market in Kupang City every Tuesday and Thursday. It is situated about 37 km from Bone Village. She usually gives the income she generates to her father to meet their daily needs and her brothers\u2019 education costs. The income that she generates from selling the agriculture products is unstable, between IDR 300,000 to IDR 450,000 per week depending on how many crops she can harvest from the farm. \r\n\r\nWith the difficulties that Natalia and family face, she got information from the TLM Field Officer about the cattle-fattening program. As a poor farmer, Natalia doesn\u2019t have enough capital to buy young cattle. She is very interested in joinging the Cattle Fattening Program.

That is why she hopes that someday, through the loan she would receive, she will be able to buy her husband his own fishing boat to manage.

He is 59 years old, married, and father to two children, ages 18 and 15.  Both go to school. Marcelino only finished fourth grade and quit when he was drafted into military service.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports his nieces and nephews, who live with him.\r\n\r\nMarcelino left Pemba for Maputo while completing his military service, and after his discharge he did not return to the land of his birth.  He has received a pension from the National Defense Ministry for more than ten years.  He has no employees and receives a monthly pension of 4,089 meticais, which he uses for household expenses and sometimes saves some money at home.\r\n\r\nMarcelino has never taken out loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through the head of his neighborhood.  This is his second loan.  He is asking for 15,000 meticais, which he will use to buy construction materials (cement, iron, blocks, sand and other materials)  to keep building his home.  The previous loan was for 7,200 meticais and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wants to ask for more loans so he can continue building his house and can furnish it.  For this reason, he promises to pay off this loan promptly.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

He is 50 years old, married and the father of a 6 year-old who is in school. He only went to school until the 6th grade due to lack of financial resources.  He lives with his family in his own house and supports a stepson who lives with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Gaza to go to Maputo to learn how to be a mason. He later started working for a company as a locksmith. He has 10 years of experience in that area. He does not have any employees. He earns 4.000.00mt per month that goes to household expenses and a savings account. He has never requested loans from other banks.

She is 46 years old, single and the mother of 4 children who are 28, 24, 21 and 16 years-old. The youngest two are in school. She only went to school until the 4th grade due to emotional problems. She lives with her children in her own house and supports a daughter-in-law who lives with her. \r\n\r\nShe has never left Maputo, has always lived there with her parents. She has had her own business since 2005 and has one employee who helps her with it. She has an average income of 300.00mt per day, equivalent to 9.000.00mt per month which goes to household expenses. She also puts 1.500.00mt into a savings account. \r\n\r\nShe has never requested loans from other banks. She came to know Hluvuku through her business associates who were already partners of the bank.  This loan, in the amount of 15.000.00mt, is her second. She intends to buy supplies (beer, sodas, hamburgers, eggs and others) in order to increase the quantity and diversify her products.  The previous loan was for 9.000.00mt applied towards the same activity. \r\n\r\nShe is committed to duly paying her loan in order to be able to request other loans. In the future, she would like to request more loans to open another business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

When she sold the pigs after four months of raising, the profit she earned from this business was fair enough. With that she was able to make a step towards achieving her goal for her family.\r\n\r\nPresently, Victoria is requesting from Kiva a much larger loan so as to be able to grow her business further. She hopes that her profit will grow and she will be able to have enough savings to purchase a fishing boat for her fisherman husband. At present, in order for him to go fishing, he borrows a fishing boat from their neighbor when it is not being used.\r\n\r\nDespite the present economic situation of her family which is very poor, Victoria is still optimistic that someday, through her business, their way of life will be changed and all of their children will graduate from

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly twothirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Elmurod and his wife are grateful to everyone who chooses to support them. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is because the town is located on the coast of the beautiful Yssyk Kul Lake.  The current situation in the town is fairly sad.  Emptiness and pale cascades of huge factories remind us of the former might of this town.  Aynura C., who is the leader of this group, lives in Balykchi.  She is forty-one years old.  Aynura is a caring mother, wife and also a conscientious teacher.  She is raising three sons.  The oldest son is already eighteen years old.  He attends a conservatory and dreams of becoming a national artist.  The middle and youngest sons are fourteen and twelve years old respectively.  They both attend school for now.  Aynura\u2019s husband tends livestock and is involved in animal husbandry.  He fattens the livestock, butchers it and sells the meat wholesale.  Aynura works as a Russian language teacher at a secondary school.  Because Aynura is closely involved with the education sphere, she understands the importance of education to the future of her children.  Aynura and her husband spent several years planning the financial aspects of their children\u2019s education.  Four years ago, they started using their savings to buy small livestock, which they then sold at the market and among their acquaintances.  This is how they found an opportunity to earn some extra money.  However, one salary of a shepherd and a salary of a school teacher, and a small income from their business are not enough to provide their children with a valuable education.  Currently, Aynura needs a loan.  She needs to repay a debt for her son\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nAynura has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nAygul S. is forty-two years old.  Her husband works at a special purpose squad.  Aygul is a secondary school teacher.  She has a very low salary of just 1850 som.  However, her husband\u2019s salary saves the whole family.  Aygul requested the loan in order to buy furniture or a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nNazgul A. is thirty-eight years old.  Her husband works as a dispatcher.  Together, they are raising three children.  Nazgul\u2019s daughter will complete eleventh grade this year.  Due to this, Nazgul requested a loan in order to buy clothing for her daughter.  And she wants to use the rest of the money to buy household goods.\r\n\r\nDamira Mysagulova is forty-seven years old.  She works at a secondary school as a librarian and also as a teacher.

Durbubu hopes to obtain a loan and purchase some sheep to breed and to plough their field. She believes that daily labor is the best way to give their granddaughter the best upbringing. \r\n\r\nDurbubu\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nRima, 40, is a mother of five children. Her husband works as a shepherd. All her children except the eldest daughter still go to school. Rima has applied for this loan to purchase two sheep.

is married with two teenage children. He lives in Vodyanoye, Ukraine and grows early spring vegetables for sale in the local markets in his region. Vitalyi owns six arch greenhouses where he does tomato and radish farming. He has been in the business for eight years. Vitalyi currently has 70,000 Grivnyas invested in his business. Annually he spends about 30,000 Grivnyas on seeds and polyethylene protective film. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a 10,000 Grivnya loan to buy five rolls of polyethylene film to repair the greenhouses damaged during heavy winter snowfalls and ice. The loan will give him the chance to sow seedlings in his greenhouses on time. One of Vitalyi\u2019s short-term plans is to finish construction of the seventh greenhouse on his property. Profits generated last year enabled Vitalyi to buy a vehicle which helped in many aspects of his business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":508406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase polyethylene film and repair his greenhouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vitalyi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1275,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10053.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159657725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:13Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:25:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185751,"name":"Sepora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sepora A. is currently in the business of selling onions and cooking oil at the market.

is a small-scale farmer from the town of Antonovka in the Kherson region. He grows and sells tomatoes, cucumbers and onions. Petro owns a greenhouse, a garden and a big lot of land. Every spring he buys seedlings and sows them in his spacious greenhouse. Currently, Petro has 100,000 Grivnyas invested in this venture.    \r\n\r\nPetro is hoping to use the loan of 12,000 Grivnyas to buy fixtures for his greenhouse, as well as fertilizers and agricultural pesticides for this farming season.

Y. is the president of the loan group called Tuchukuliane; she is the one in the photo raising her hand with a brilliant smile. She is taking out her 15th loan. She is 36, married, and the mother of 4 children. Three of them attend school and the youngest is not yet school-aged. Her husband is a nurse. \r\n\r\n She opened up her little business with her own money that she had received from her husband. This working capital allowed her to buy a container of oil worth $13. She sells palm oil in a little market in the populous neighborhood of TMK. On Mondays and Thursdays she goes to the big market of Kituku, 15 km from the town of Goma. She has been selling palm oil for 13 years. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from the micro-finance institution Hekima, Ngabo M. Y. wishes to increase her sales by buying 20 jerrycans of palm oil. In future, she plans to stop doing her buying in Goma and go directly to the production centre in OICHA, a rural town in the far north of North Kivu province, and in the long run, she hopes to build a comfortable house. She also intends to buy a vehicle for the transport of her merchandise, and to invest in chicken-farming as well. \r\n\r\n Ngabo M. Y. thanks the MFI Hekima for the loans that she receives without any tangible assets as collateral because it is due to these loans that she manages to support her children. \r\n\r\nThe Tuchukuliane group is composed of 14 members, mostly women.                  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She is married to Leonard Kirui and they are blessed with three beautiful children. Emily lives in Sergoit in Eldoret, where she practices farming. On her piece of land, she plants maize, which she sells to her clients who happen to be her neighbors.

Her husband is a bailiff in a co-op. Please note that this mother has two sets of twins. \r\n\r\nShe began her little business with her own working capital of US$ 10, received from her neighbor as a non-reimbursable loan aimed at helping her situation. She goes around the streets of Goma selling used shoes. She has been in this business for 14 years. She also sells potatoes out of her home to add to her income. \r\n\r\nWith the micro-finance institution Hekima's loan,  Mbavu C. hopes to raise her profit by buying 20 pairs of used shoes. In future, she plans to change businesses by opening a little general store and in the long run she hopes to be able to buy a plot of land for her family. \r\n\r\nMbavu C. thanks MFI Hekima for the loans that she has received without any tangible assets as collateral because it is thanks to these loans that she manages to support her children. \r\n\r\nThis group is made up of 21 members, all women with the exception of one man. Please also note that our client  Kabuo K. is ill and her husband represented her, for which reason there are two men visible in the group photo. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

She has a son, who is 23. The son is a member of a farm association. She and her son make their living by raising cattle. Three years ago, Mira bought some sheep and started breeding. In spite of all the difficulties, she was able to save $340 and invest in purchasing cattle. Now her monthly income constitutes around $135. Mira has applied for this loan as she hopes to buy a cow to feed and subsequently sell its milk. This coming fall, she plans to marry her son. \r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see how people of a relatively old age show this much perseverance and genuine desire to achieve success in their businesses. They are like the runner who has run all the way and, when everybody expects he will fall down from exhaustion and fatigue, suddenly looks ahead and with a smile begins to pick up his pace. \r\n\r\nMira is the leader of this group. Mira\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nGulsyina, 51, is a widow. She has two children. To make a living, Gulsyina keeps some cattle. Her children provide a tremendous help looking after the cattle. Gulsyina's monthly income from trading in cattle is around $95. Gulsyina needs a loan to invest in increasing the total population of her livestock. \r\n\r\nToktobubu, 48, is married and has two children. Her husband is an electrician. They keep cattle and sell some of their livestock from time to time to meet their needs. Toktobubu needs a loan to invest in purchasing more cattle. \r\n\r\nJyldyz, 49, is divorced. She is the mother of three children. All the children help their mother look after the livestock. The eldest son is a farmer; the other two children still go to school. Jyldyz has applied for this loan to increase the total population of her livestock. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3 P's concept: <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

She has reached an old age and still works. She has been working for her whole life with the sole purpose of providing a happy and decent life for her family. Suior, even at this age, does not want to sit on a couch watching TV. \r\n\r\nHer main activity is raising cattle: the activity which has been passed down from generation to generation and has finally reached her. Suior has many years experience raising cattle and this has made her a professional livestock raiser. Now, despite being a widow, she does not feel old and alone. She just does not have time for that. \r\n\r\nAll her children are grown\u2013up and live separately with their families, except the youngest son, Rahatbek. According to the Kyrgyz tradition, the smallest child stays with the parents and looks after them. Her son purchases cattle and Suior looks after them. Rahatbek is just twenty four years old. However, having a mother like Suior, he does not need to be afraid of lacking in experience. Five years ago, he started this business with three sheep which he bought at the cattle market. He sold them after raising them and was able to earn good money. At this time Suior needs a loan to purchase five to six sheep for feeding and resale. \r\n\r\nSuior\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nBorukchu D., 70, is retired. Borukchu and his wife want to start a business. Their children are all married and live separately. Borukchu plans to purchase cattle to sell after feeding. Therefore, Borukchu has applied for this loan to buy cattle. \r\n\r\nSonunbubu I., 68, is a mother of seven children. Her husband is a professional livestock raiser. He is retired now and has sufficient time to get engaged in raising cattle. Sonunbubu hopes to obtain this loan to invest in purchasing cattle. \r\n\r\nJyldyzhan A., 43, and her husband are engaged in cattle breeding. They have two children. Their daughter goes to college and their son is a school student. Jyldyzhan hopes to obtain this loan to invest in increasing his cattle population.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of both its customers and the society), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

They have children and, for the sake of them and their future, these people are making great sacrifices every day. \r\n\r\nKulshara is the leader of this group. She is forty three years old. Her husband is a member of a farm association. When he has free time he works as a taxi driver. Together they have raised five children. Two of her daughters are married while the other three children are school students. \r\n\r\nKulshara is a housewife. Besides running a household, she has about five sheep. Whenever they need money they sell sheep to meet their needs. Sometimes they butcher the sheep and sell the meat. This activity brings them around 45 dollars a month. They started keeping sheep ten years ago. Originally they bought three sheep, fed them and sold them. This made them a pretty decent profit and became their usual way of earning money. As a result, they have been able to raise their children without obstacles. Kulshara is applying for a loan to buy one cow to produce milk for sale. \r\n\r\nKulshara has four partners:\r\n\r\nTurganbubu, 56, raises cattle. Currently she has a horse. Her children have grown up and Turganbubu is already raising her grandchildren. Her husband is a retired man and he actively helps her look after the cattle. Turganbubu hopes to obtain this loan to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nSalkynbubu, 58, is the wife of a school teacher. She stays at home and looks after cattle. Salkynbubu is the mother of eight children. All her children have grown up and now make their own living. Salkynbubu has applied for this loan to buy some sheep.\r\n\r\nSharapat, 58, is the mother of eight children. All her children are grown\u2013up and live separately. Sharapat and her husband are retired. They keep some cattle and need a loan to purchase cattle. \r\n\r\nAinura, 47, has two children. Her husband works in the local municipality. Ainura has a small shop and sells foodstuffs. She needs a loan to purchase some sheep. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of both its customers and the society), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

A. has been operating her business from the corner opposite the central market for nearly 20 years. She is asking for a loan because she would like to stock her store with merchandise that she doesn't have yet. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora M. A. has three children. She knew she had to work very hard to move forward for them. Two are already professionals but are unemployed right now. Although her other daughter is a student, all three help her with sales. \r\n\r\nSeven days a week, she comes to the market at eight-thirty in the morning and stays until around 6 in the evening. They sell hotdogs, sodas, fried chicken with french fries, hamburgers and sandwiches. \r\n\r\nPreviously, Se\u00f1ora M. peddled cosmetics but then decided to put 3,000 C. that she had saved into starting a business. Now her business has more furnishings her clients can enjoy, gets more sunshine better airconditioning and has an awning. She tells us that all this success is thanks to Ceprodel because we gave her the financing she needed to get ahead and support her children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sierra Visher,

She has reached an old age, and specifically, she is already fifty years old.  However, Gulbayra is no hurry to rest.  Her three children have become adults a long time ago.  The oldest son is single and works at a company in Bishkek, and the daughter is married.  The youngest son is also single and works at a furniture factory.  Having such good children, any mother would have preferred to stay home and rest.  But this is not Gulbayra\u2019s calling.  She spends and has spent her life in a water funnel of everyday life, in hard work.  Currently, she sells livestock at the livestock market.  Gulbayra started her business five years ago, when she and her husband fattened and sold one bull and put the profit into turnover.  Now, Gulbayra is primarily involved in the business, but always uses her husband\u2019s support.  He works at a school.  And just like many employees in this field, her husband\u2019s salary is not high at all.  Thanks to Gulbayra\u2019s business, they live fairly well.  Gulbayra achieved a lot over the years: bought a plot of land in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyzstan) to be used for construction, married off her daughter.  Her monthly income is about five thousand som ($110).  Gulbayra decided to request a loan because she wants to buy two bulls for resale.  In the future, she plans to marry off her sons, build a house and expand the business by increasing the livestock headcount.\r\n\r\nGulbayra has four partners in the group:\r\n\r\nDinara B. is thirty-seven years old.  She is a widow and has two daughters, both of whom attend school.  Dinara works as a system administrator at the city registry.  She wants to obtain this loan in order to buy an electric oven, DVD player and vacuum cleaner.\r\n\r\nJanyl M. is fifty-two years old.  Her husband is a specialist at the city registry.  And Janyl sells merchandise at a store.  She has three sons, two of whom still live with their parents.  Janyl wants to obtain the loan and buy two bags of sugar for resale.\r\n\r\nYrysbubu K. is sixty-seven years old.  She and her husband are retired.  Current life, however, showed that a person with desire and will can become whoever she wants to be at any age.  Yrysbubu is a businesswoman.  She sells cattle and horses.  She needs the loan to buy three sheep.\r\n\r\nBolgonay T. is fifty-five years old.  She raised six children, all of whom are grown and lead independent lives.  Bolgonay still works.  She makes women\u2019s knitwear to-order.  She hopes to obtain the loan and purchase thirty rolls of knit thread.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":508478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of two bulls for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulbayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dinara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janyl","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irisbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bolgonay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10389},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10869},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":11372},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":11898},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12449},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13023}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":237.46,"local_amount":10389,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10484.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715761,"comment":null},{"amount":248.44,"local_amount":10869,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10968.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748608,"comment":null},{"amount":259.93,"local_amount":11372,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11476.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931582,"comment":null},{"amount":271.95,"local_amount":11898,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":12007.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670595,"comment":null},{"amount":284.55,"local_amount":12449,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12563.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884248,"comment":null},{"amount":297.67,"local_amount":13023,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":13142.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T02:08:25Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185810,"name":"Leonardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"este cliente es originario de la cuidad de leon, ha resibido diferentes creditos con el animo de mejorar las condiciones de vida, ya que ha tenido varios creditos, como construccion de vivienda, compra de motos,y este ultimo para lo antes mencionado.

She collects the garments once a week and later applies the embroidery to the front of the sweaters, including flowers or the landscape of the mountains.  These sweaters are in high demand in other countries.  She likes this work very much, since it keeps her occupied and is profitable because they pay for each embroidered item according to the details of the needles, the complexity and the time spent.  When she has a lot of work she supports her daughter, since the more embroidery she does the higher her earnings.  In this way she wants to provide a college education for her daughter.

She is a single woman who lives alone and covers her expenses herself. Juliette lives in the Agla neighborhood of Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. She went to primary school only. In order to provide for her needs, she has a business selling shoes and clothes for men and women. Juliette gets her supplies in Lom\u00e9 in Togo, but also on the Missebo market in Cotonou. However, she sells her products in front of her house in Agla. Juliette has been carrying out this business for the past twelve years and has already benefited from three loans from ALID\u00e9. She made all the repayments on the previous loans she took out. Juliette would like to increase her stock of products and diversify her business in order to satisfy her customers more. For this reason she is applying for a fourth loan. Later on, Juliette is planning to open a shop to sell her products there and attract more customers.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":508484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of second hand clothing for women and men, as well as shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-19T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":15481.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653264,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15481.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835471,"comment":null},{"amount":260,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":123851.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575868,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-19T15:52:52Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185816,"name":"Asociaci\u00f3n Sin Fronteras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Asociaci\u00f3n sin Fronteras est\u00e1 conformado por tres mujeres trabajadoras y emprendedoras provenientes de Masaya ciudad de la flores y cuna de folklor nicarag\u00fcense.

Her house is in an urbanized area south of the city.\r\n\r\nFor 25 years she has been making military clothing like shirts, berets, slippers, and pants.

Her two daughters help her.  She takes the clothes to a specialized sewing house because they need to have good finishings, and they need to be reinforced.  This can only be done with special machines.  Even though she needs to pay for the sewing, making these items is very profitable.  They contract her to make large amounts of clothing.  That is why Hilda dreams of one day setting up her own business.  She already has a good customer list.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she promises to make all of her payments punctually.

This is the first time they have had a loan together.\r\n\r\nIdania Aurora E. D\u00edaz is the president of the group.  She is 30, and she went to school until the third year of pre-university.  She does not have children.  She sells meat, a business she started 15 years ago.  She is asking for a loan to buy animals for her butcher shop.  Her customers think she is a responsible person because she sells good meat at fair prices.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda is another member of this group.  She is 47, and she has an elementary school education.  She has four daughters (two are 24, one is 26, and the other is 30).  She has been working as a seamstress for ten years.  She is asking for a loan to buy fabric.  Her customers seek her out because she is a responsible woman and her sewing has the guarantee of being good quality.  As she is asking for this loan, she feels capable of paying the loan, and she has a great desire to work.  She wants this loan to buy material to make uniforms for the school cycle that is coming.  She wants to have her business stocked in order to give her customers good, quality service.  She also hopes to use her earnings to paint her house and to be able to buy a dining room.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\u2022 Idania Aurora E.

She has a grocery business and operates the small store from her home which is in a very populous neighborhood in the south of Lima. She has had this business for nearly eight years. At first her partner would help her but now its her mother who helps out when she has to purchase merchandise. She is happy with this activity because its very successful, particularly in the mornings. In the afternoon, after her friend suggested it, she embroiders cotton polo shirts.

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the Hamdallaye \"B\" district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Having been to a Koranic school rather than a classic school, for religious reasons, she abandoned her schooling in the 6th grade of the Mali education system in order to go into a small business with her mother who sold incense. After several years at her side and having gained a rich experience in commercial activity, she began to develop a business alone, opting for the sale of various articles including thermos flasks, bed sheets, bedovers etc.. and has been doing this for ten years now. She enjoys a large customer base and pubic renown. \r\n\r\nWith a view to increasing her business and in order to carry it out more effectively she has turned to Soro Yiriwaso. She has taken out an individual loan which she is planning to use to buy 20 sets of sheets and 15 thermos flasks. She gets her supplies in Burkina Faso and sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of women and men.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she envisages making a monthly profit of 75,000 FCFA. This profit will allow her to contribute to social events and to family expenses.

At 3 p.m. Dominga opens up a clothing stand at the entrance to her home, where she has sold clothing for many years.  She really likes this business because it generates good profits; she gives most of the credit to the items she sells and to her neighbors.  On weekends she dedicates all of her time to selling clothing, since those are very busy days for her business.  Dominga\u2019s greatest wish is to have a large quantity of garments, especially the ones that are sought after by young girls in the neighborhood, as those are what sell the most quickly.

Her husband works as a courier at the Yanbal cosmetics factory. They live in the city of Cuenca, where they can enjoy the colonial beauty of a historical center. The rivers nourish the city, people and gastronomy, making it one of the most visited places in the country by natives and foreigners. Adriana dedicates herself to the household chores and caring for her niece. On Saturdays, she works cleaning other people's homes until midday. Her friend Alexandra encouraged her to join this group of enterprising women, which joined forces with Kiva partner Comunal Pro Mujer to make headway for their families and to have more and better opportunities for personal and economic advancement. This is the group's first loan, and with her portion Adriana plans to start a small bazaar for which she will purchase cards, stuffed animals, gifts, jewelry, school supplies, clothing, and other personal and household products. Her goal is to resume her studies since she has a first-grade education.\r\n\r\nSandra D. is another member of the community bank, and she lives in the city with her husband and their three children, ages 22, 21 and 17, all of whom are either studying in college or high school. It is not her own home, but her in-laws live in a separate area. Because her husband is a veterinarian, he runs his office out of the home to save on expenses.

She has made a living for the past four years selling groceries out of a small convenience store installed in her home. The business started out of the necessity to find an activity to generate income to solve personal expenses and support her family, whose finances depend on agriculture, which isn't permanent income. At her small business, she offers all kinds of snacks and drinks to her customer. This is very useful to her neighbors since the area is located a little ways outside of the city. She prefers to buy products in small quantities and always travels to the city of Chiclayo to stock her business with fresh products.

Since she has separated from her husband she has worked in several offices. She saw that she was neglecting the upbringing of her children. So she decided to work selling sodas and ice cream from the first floor of her mother\u2019s house. She has worked for fifteen years in this business and she has enjoyed it. Actually, she also sells beer. The largest quantities of beer sales are during the weekends. She is well known to her neighbors and thanks to them her business has generated a good income. She is very motivated to continue working. In the upcoming months she is going to begin to knit sweaters. Her neighbor, who knits, invited her to join her in this work. She can knit while she works in her store. In the future she would like to install booths with Internet access in her large location. She would like to sell time on the Internet. This is her seventh loan with MFP and she promises to punctually pay all her payments as she has done in the past. Also, she is well regarded by the other members of the community bank who are very responsible and very hard working. Elsa would like to purchase cases of beer with part of this loan and with the other part she would like to buy yarn in many colors in order to begin knitting sweaters.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":508628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"She will buy many cases of beer ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T03:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":422.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993376,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":422.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718174,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":422.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751849,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":422.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934309,"comment":null},{"amount":89.72,"local_amount":249.23,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":252.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673082,"comment":null},{"amount":209.8,"local_amount":582.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":591.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886908,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-19T01:57:13Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185875,"name":"Eliot","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

Currently he lives with his wife in the Olmos district, located in Lambayeque province, an hour and forty-five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years he has worked in public transport with a mototaxi (motorized vehicle used to transport people and cargo).  He covers the routes inside the city of Olmos and its farm villages.  These transports are a big help in the rural areas where they are the only means of transportation that the poor can use to get to their farms.\r\n\r\nSegundo is very dedicated to his work.  He tells us that this work makes him feel useful, active, and he really enjoys it.  The problem is that the rural roads are very rough and this always causes damage to vehicles.  Now his mototaxi has begun to experience some technical problems that urgently need repair  to be able to run correctly.  That is why he is asking for a loan for the first time with Edpyme Alternativa of 1000 new sols.  He plans to use it to repair and maintain his vehicle.\r\n\r\nSegundo is well-known and respected by the neighbors in the area where he lives.

It has been a year since she became a member.  She says that one of her colleagues invited her to participate.\r\n\r\nGloria is 24 years old and single.  She studied in the San Antonio Abad University in Cusco, in the education department, and she specialized in teaching at the primary level.  She worked in the private school \u201cRosa de Am\u00e9rica\u201d for 3 years and now is hoping to be hired as a national teacher so that she can work for the state.  Gloria needs to specialize, because the Peruvian state only hires people who have an educational specialty at the level of a Master's or Doctorate, and for this reason Gloria is studying toward the Master's degree in the private university \"Cesar Vallejo,\" for which she pays 500 Peruvian soles per month.  Gloria will use the loan to pay her monthly fees and for her personal expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is very pleased with the opportunity provided through these means, and is committed to making the payments according to the established timeframe.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":508645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay monthly educational fees for Master's program in education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-03-19T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":235.49},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":244.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":254.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":264.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.31},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88.4,"local_amount":235.73,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":249.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128906077,"comment":null},{"amount":91.93,"local_amount":245.16,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":259.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633556,"comment":null},{"amount":95.61,"local_amount":254.96,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":269.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667975,"comment":null},{"amount":99.06,"local_amount":264.15,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":279.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851633,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-20T00:27:39Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185885,"name":"Joel De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Joel De Jes\u00fas Hern\u00e1ndez M..

It is made up of 18 members, residents of the city of Temuco. They work in different independent businesses such as: pastrymaking, manufacturing of saddles and spurs, sewing, selling used clothes, firewood and charcoal, and recycling copper, bronze and aluminum.  \r\n\r\nThe member who was interviewed was Mar\u00eda Magdalena, the president of the group. In the photo, she is seated in the first row, fourth from the left. She sells recyclable materials such as cardboard, bottles, metal, iron, and scrap (such as beverage cans). She has been at the business for 39 years.  She has two adult children and her daughter also belongs to this group and sells fast food.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magdalena will invest this loan in merchandise, since she doesn't only collect but also buys whatever she needs.  She also has the motivation to begin to sell french fries in a cart she outfitted a little with previous loans. The cart is at her house. For this she will buy oil, potatoes, paper, condiments (ketchup and mustard), and napkins. \r\n\r\nFor her it has been very important to work with Fondo Esperanza. It has been a big financial, moral and motivational support, thanks to the weekly meetings in which she shares with the other members and learns about how to manage her business. For  Mar\u00eda Magdalena, it is very important to stay busy and useful. Some time ago she was depressed and her business helped her to get better. \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. The city is 670 kilometers from Santiago ( the capital of Chile). It has a series of lake beaches and very striking native flora and fauna. It's worth noting that in this region live 50% of the Mapuches, an indigenous group that exists in our country. This area was damaged by the recent earthquake that affected Chile, but this communal bank suffered no ill effects from it.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

Her house is located in a crowded neighborhood in the south of the city.\r\n<p>\r\nPreviously, she was employed as a seamstress, but it was very exhausting work, and required her to neglect her children. She left her seamstress job 6 years ago and began embroidering sweaters.  Since then she has applied embroidery to all the sweaters that are brought to her, and when they are finished they are exported to other countries.  She likes this work a lot since she is able to work in the quiet of her home and, in addition, is paid a set price for each garment depending on the complexity of the design that she embroiders and the amount of work required.  For this reason she prefers to accomplish as much embroidery as possible.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to get ahead, her wish is to supply herself with a large quantity of wool in order to be able to weave and apply embroidery consistently.  She believes that in that way her earnings will be better.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP, and she promises to be punctual with the payment of each one of her installments.  Guillermina is planning on investing the loan applied for in the purchase of different types of wool with which she will be able to apply embroidery to sweaters more easily.

She sells general merchandise such as clothing and cosmetics, and she also markets products in large quantities such as cooking oil, rice, soap and skin creams.  She has worked with the Fundaci\u00f3n for more than 7 years.  She started out working in a solidarity group, but as her business was growing she became independent and acquired her own credit account.  She now requests a loan in the amount of $2,000.00 which she will use to buy products in large volume, such as cooking oil, rice, soap and foodstuffs to supply to stores and to meet the demands of some housewives.\r\n\r\nHer family raised livestock in the Magdalena department (region), but for questions of security they sold the house in that town and when they arrived they bought another in the Siete de Abril neighborhood of  Barranquilla.  From there they began to sell gold and silver jewelry, but their first business was a store, which they closed because they were not familiar with the way that the market works in Barranquilla; later they started to sell merchandise in Pelayo in the Cesar department with a friend, with whom they shared the profits. They traveled to Maicao (a municipality of Colombia located on the Venezuelan border) in order to buy electric appliances such as blenders, fans, irons, etc.  In her business they have two markets: the main one is selling to stores that sell food products, and the second is selling directly to housewives. This second market, although it generates a higher return, is conducted on a smaller scale.  These housewives live in other communities because she does not want to compete with the stores where she sells her products; she does not want to lose them as customers since they generate a good cash flow, so in this way she cares for her market.  In the future, her goal is to improve her home and her main challenge is to build a second floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

El nos comenta que tuvo la oportunidad de trabajar en este rubro gracias a una bolichera que el y sus seis hermanos heredaron de su padre. Actualmente todos se valen de esta para ganarse el sustento.\n\nEllos se hacen a la mar cuando el tiempo es favorable y se quedan ahi por varios dias, los productos que logran extraer son vendidos en el mismo muelle a los comerciantes que luego los ofrecen en el terminal que queda en el mismo distrito.\n\nIsidro y sus hermanos han estado invirtiendo algunas ganancias en brindarle mantenimiento a su instrumento de trabajo,  el desea hacer algunas mejoras en la infraestructura de la bolichera para optimizar su funcionamiento, por ello se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles que le ayuden a lograr su objetivo.\n\nIsidro es una persona responsable y que conoce mucho de su trabajo, su mayor anhelo es poder equipar a la bolichera con instrumentos que optimicen su labor como por ejemplo un transmisor de radio que acaba de comprar y que nos muestra en la imagen.\n\n","en":"Isidro is 53 years old, married, and lives with his wife and three children in the Santa Rosa district, an area whose economy depends principally on fishing, and which is located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nIsidro has worked in fishing for 15 years, and this work has provided him with sufficient income to support his family during this time.  He tells us that he had the opportunity to work in this field thanks to a small fishing boat that he and his six brothers inherited from their father.  Today they all count on this boat to earn their living.\r\n\r\nThey all go to sea when the weather is favorable, and they stay there for several days.  The fish that they are able to catch are sold from the dock where they land to the merchants who later sell the fish in a market at that district's terminal.\r\n\r\nIsidro and his brothers have been saving some of their earnings to put toward the maintenance of their instrument of work.  He hopes to make some improvements to the infrastructure of the boat in order to optimize its functionality.  To do so, he has seen the necessity to request a loan of 1000 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa, which would help him to achieve his goal.\r\n\r\nIsidro is a responsible person who is very knowledgable about his profession.  He greatest longing is to be able to equip his boat with instruments that optimize he and his brothers' labor, including items like the radio transmitter he holds in the photo, which he just purchased.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":508744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Gastos de mantenimiento de infraestructura de bolichera.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa -

Mrs. Bernarda owns a food business, which she started three years ago in order to help support her family. Even though the business is not very old, she has 26 years of experience selling food. Her mother taught her at a very young age that she had to learn to earn a living and would send her out to the street to sell tortillas and sometimes bread. She has asked for the loan in order to buy a large enough supply of staple grains to avoid the price fluctuations of these items. It is worth mentioning that she also owns a small general store at home, thanks to which her earnings have improved. Mrs. Bernarda hopes to give her children a university education, something she was not able to do. It is with that goal in mind that she works hard in order to provide them with opportunities her mother was never able to provide her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

However, because of the large amount of expenses her family incurs, especially her 10 children whose age range is from two to 23 years old, her income would not be enough to cover everything, including the sustainability of her small business. Despite that, Jocelyn wouldn\u2019t want to stop dreaming and hoping that their lives would change someday. Therefore, she joined ASHI, the first Kiva field partner in the Philippines, in order to request a loan, which will be used to start her own business. Having the opportunity that ASHI is giving her (especially access to loans), she is optimistic that she will be able to have a source of capital to finance the needs of her hog\/pig fattening business. Her fattened animals will be sold either slaughtered or alive to people around their village or to meat vendors in the public market. \r\n\r\nFor Jocelyn, there is no reason to give up the fight against poverty because her children are innocent about dealing with it; thus, she and her husband have to do it for them.

PMPC.

Engaged in her business for over five years, she earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Genesia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from PMPC that was used to purchase additional products to sell, Genesia is requesting a new loan, her fifth, of 10000 PHP to purchase new items to expand product offering.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
