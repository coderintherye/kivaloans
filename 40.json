Karena itu Wartini sangat memerlukan tambahan modal usaha agar bisa memelihara 3 ekor induk  babi dengan harapan dalam setahun Wartini bisa panen 6 kali. Perhitungannya, setiap induk babi melahirkan anak 10 \u2013 12 ekor dan setelah dipelihara selama 4 bulan, bisa dijual dengan harga Rp. 250.000.- per ekornya. Dan harapannya kedepan usahanya akan tetap berkembang dan menjadi besar untuk kelangsungan hidup kelurga mereka."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":69809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy animal feed and a mother pig to increase animal population <p>Membeli Induk babi untuk meningkatkan jumlah populasi ternaknya dan pakan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-29T14:05:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu Wartini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-13T16:23:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":175,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-10-16T02:04:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67788,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:38:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86618,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:43:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100276,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:17:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119080,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138539,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164688,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-09-29T16:23:09Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":19647,"name":"Edward","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edward is a married man with one child.

Since Mr \u0110\u1ea1i became a demobilized  soldier more than 20 years ago, the family's  financial situation is fragile. Being that they did not have higher education, their wish is to be able to provide a good education for their children. So when \"Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng\" fund got implanted in the district of Nghi L\u1ed9c in 2001, Ms \u0110\u1ecbnh jumped at her only chance to realize her wish. She contracted a loan of 75 USD to buy ducks for breeding. She made a small profit but that was a big motivation for her to continue. In 2004, she switched to beer brewing. This business is much more profitable. Her revenue from  beer brewing is about 125 USD a month. Her wish had been realized: her 2 children are now attending university. She's requesting a new loan of 425 USD to expand her beer brewing business.             \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khanh Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ec9 tr\u00f4ng v\u00e0o m\u1ea5y s\u00e0o ru\u1ed9ng, vi\u1ec7c nu\u00f4i 2 con \u0103n h\u1ecdc l\u00e0 \u0111i\u1ec1u kh\u00f4ng d\u1ec5 d\u00e0ng \u0111\u1ed1i v\u1edbi ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ecbnh.

Then the Banco Comunal \"Jesus Maria\" formed, and with her first credit os S\/300.00 (approximately $.96) that she received, she bought chickens and guinea pigs to breed and sell.  Little by little she went buying other, bigger animals like ewes and cattle.  \r\n<p>\r\nActually livestock and producing quesillos and cheese, also since that which she produces does not manage to cover her orders, she also breeds and sells guinea pigs, chickens and ewes; and in her shop she sells meat and other products of primary necessity.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the recent loan granted by Manuela Ramos for  S\/.800.00 she will buy ewes to fatten them up and have them to sell in the end of year celebrations.

Harapan kedepanya ternak  yang dipelihara semakin banyak dan dapat menambah pengasilan keluarga untuk membiayai kebutuhan hidup istri dan seorang anaknya yang baru ber umur  6 bulan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":70265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Membeli Pakan dan bibit Babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-29T14:05:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Putu Suryadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-13T15:37:05Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-16T03:05:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67802,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:38:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86628,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:52:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100282,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:17:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119084,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139671,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164695,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-09-29T15:37:05Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":19826,"name":"Saniyem","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Saniyem has 3 grown-up children and although some are already married, she is not freed of her responsibility because they are still living with and dependent on her.

Her children help her in her work. Before she became a client of MicroInvest, she would have to borrow the money necessary to increase turnover from local illegal moneylenders that asked for high interest. She was thrilled to hear about interest free borrowing that MicroInvest has to offer. Currently, she was able to increase turnover and secure a permanent sales location in one of the central parts of the region.

felt.\r\nThe loan being sought will be used to pay for the repair of a larger vehicle used for bigger hauls. \r\nMiriam's credit history demonstrates that she has timely and responsibly made her

Churac X., 38 years old, sells fruits and vegetables in front of her house and at the market. She learned the ropes of buying and selling fresh fruits and vegetables by working alongside her mother for 22 years. When she got married, she started her own business called \"La Guadalupana fruit sales\". She sells fruits both wholesale and retail, including apples, mangos, pineapples, and papayas. In the summer she specializes in selling fruits that grow in coastal low lands, and in the fall she sells elote, cooked corn on the cob. She travels every Saturday to the main market in the regional center of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa to purchase her whole week's inventory and then returns back to her home where she sells the fruit.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmen is married and has 6 children ranging in age from 19 to 4 years old. Her husband works in the fields cultivating crops and brings home very little money due to the poor wages and seasonality of his work. So her income is an important part of supporting her family, and she is very proud to have the wherewithall to earn it. Her dream is to provide an education to all of her children. So far she has been successful. Her oldest daughter has already graduated and now is employed as a teacher. Paying back the loan monthly is another important goal which because of her own commitment she has been successfully doing. She realizes that by being in this program she can grow her business a little bit at a time and better herself and her family slowly but surly.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a religious person and calls upon God to help her resolve the lingering problems with her first husband. She decicates her free time to working in her church and hopes that with God's help she can find her way though this challenge. \r\n<p>\r\nInterviewed by Lucia Tunay Ixcol<br\/>\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":70541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase fruit for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Yepocapa, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.504167 -90.956944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-09-30T23:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-15T01:42:01Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-11-15T10:21:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81886,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-12-15T10:21:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97478,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-01-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116028,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135750,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158364,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183035,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210563,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238684,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267549,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-01T01:42:01Z","paid_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":19937,"name":"Dina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dina A.

Karena sadar akan penghasilan suaminya yang pas-pasan sebagai petani musiman. Bersama suaminya dia merintis usaha ini. Dua tahun yang lalu dengan modal Rp 500.000,00 dia membeli 2 ekor babi yang dipelihara secara  tradisional - mengikatnya di bawah pohon. Makanan yang di berikan berupa  ubi umbi talas \/ daun kangkung yang ada di sekitarnya. Hasil yang diperoleh Rp 800.000,00 \/3 bulan. Melihat hasil yg diperoleh tersebut, Bu Win menambah jumlah peliharaannya dengan membeli 2 ekor bibit lagi dengan meminjam modal dari DINARI. Dengan 4 ekor induk babi yang Ibu Win miliki saat ini, maka hasil penjualannya mencapai Rp 2.000.000,00 \/ 3 bulan. Bu Win berharap dengan usaha ini dia dapat membantu memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga sehari - hari yang mencapai Rp 400.000,00 \/bulan, bahkan bisa membeli bambu anyaman (gedhek) untuk mengganti dinding rumahnya yang sudah lapuk"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy feedstock

The daughter no longer receives treatment at the Fundabien Institution so the burden falls on Maria's shoulders Sometime she gets depressed and feels overwhelmed. But she has 6 other children that need her love and care, so she carries on the best she can. Her dream is to make sure the rest of the children get an education so they can get a good start in life. So she tends the store in the morning and sells her prepared food in the afternoon  and cares for her family. Every day is a struggle; but, for the sake of her family, she fights on knowing someday things will get better.\r\n<p>\r\nInterviewed by Lucia Tunay Ixcol<br\/>\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":71166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase supplies for the store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Yepocapa, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.504167 -90.956944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-10-01T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-16T00:50:21Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:23:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82337,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:24:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97975,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116529,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136364,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159083,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183846,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211408,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239557,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268485,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-02T00:50:21Z","paid_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20006,"name":"Guljamol","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Guljamol has been a MicroInvest client for 3 years.

Suaminya bekerja sebagai petani. Bu Luh Taman membantu suaminya bekerja di ladang. Meskipun repot mengurus tiga orang anaknya, dia masih menyempatkan diri mengurus usaha yang sudah di tekuni sejak menikah yaitu beternak babi. Pagi hari sambil mengerjakan pekerjaan di dapur dia dibantu Komang Yuli Astuti - anak gadisnya - mengurus ternak babinya. Babi peliharaannya ditempatkan di kandang sederhana tidak jauh dari belakang rumahnya. Per bulannya dia bisa mendapatkan tambahan pendapatan sebesar Rp 300.000,00 dari hasil penjualan 6 ekor ternak babinya saat ini.

She sells chickens to entrepreneurs like herself for their businesses.  People from nearby communities come to Maria to buy her chickens, and they in turn sell them in their own communities.  Maria estimates that she sells an average of 300-400 pesos' worth of chicken in a day (US$ 9-12).  She has three staff: her husband, herself, and her son are in charge of running the business each day.  She supports six people in her household on a daily basis\u2014herself, her husband, her son, and her 3 grandsons.\r\n<p>\r\nNOTE: This is a group loan. The $1,200 will fund Maria's business plus 4 others in her community. She and four other entrepreneurs have formed a solidarity group that received business training from Esperanza and guarantee each other's loan repayment. This group-lending methodology fosters accountability among the members because they all must pay in full and on time.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is very thankful for the loans from Esperanza and hopes to continue taking them out as long as she can.  Before she had her loans, she had to depend on her husband\u2019s earnings, which were not stable.  She is now very proud that she maintains a constant source of income, and that she has been able to expand her business with each loan.  Just this week she bought a pig for 8,000 RD pesos (about US$ 240) with savings from her and her husband\u2019s income\u2014without the loans they would never have had the savings to invest in a pig.  She hopes one day to build a home out of concrete blocks, and a cement roof; her house right now is made from wood with a corrugated zinc roof; she worries that if a hurricane comes her house will be destroyed.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is a savvy micro-entrepeneur. She explains that with the income she earns from the loans, she is careful to both save and re-invest her money.  Buying a pig with her savings will allow her to earn more money in the next year from the pork she is able to sell.  Once she begins to earn more money from her pig, she will begin saving so that she can build a better and safer house for her family.  Maria is most thankful that she has had the blessing of these loans and is grateful that she is being given the opportunity to take out another one."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":71337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase chickens for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"El Seybo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.8 -69.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-10-02T16:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-16T21:52:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:22:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82784,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:24:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98478,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117159,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137138,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159915,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184738,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-02T21:52:45Z","paid_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20077,"name":"Lidia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lidia is asking for her third loan.

Her dream of becoming a successful business owner however has already been shaken on two separate occasions because the people with whom she tried to forge her dreams abandoned her while she was pregnant. This affected her deeply, nevertheless, thanks to her abilities as a strong woman she has continued on full-speed ahead and will not allow herself to be brought down by adversities. She sees in her daughters the meaning and importance of life. They give her the strength she needs to keep going and reach her goals.  Luz has started selling fuel again, but the high price of the leasing of the space takes up most of her earnings. It is for this reason that she asks for a sum of 325 dollars in order to begin the construction of her own space in which she can sell her fuel and a small house in the same place so that she can administer her establishment directly.

Setiap 4bulan sekali kedua induk babi ini akan melahirkan anaknya dan akan siap dijual setelah berumur 1,5 sampai 2 bulan sejak lahir.Satu ekor babi biasanya mempunyai anak 6 sampai 10 ekor.Dari penjualan anak-anak babi ini biasanya Wayan Kolih mendapat keuntungan Rp.1.500.000 setiap 6 bulan sekali.Keuntungan ini dipergunakan untuk biaya sekolah  kedua anaknya yang kini duduk dibangku SMU, karena penghasilan suaminya sebagai seorang petani tidak tentu sehingga tidak bisa mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga,keuntungan ini juga sedikit demi sedikit dipergunakan untuk memperbaiki rumahnya yang kini masih semi permanen.Sedangkan pinjaman yang diperoleh dari DINARI dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit babi yang lebih bagus dan berkwalitas karena akan dipelihara sebagai penggemukan ,agar hasil yang didapat  lebih baik."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig feedstock<p>Membeli bibit babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-04T03:15:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Kolih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-18T05:18:15Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T01:55:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70368,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86640,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:52:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100296,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119100,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139687,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164707,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-04T05:18:15Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20114,"name":"Goma Khan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goma Khan lives in District 16 of Kabul, Afghanistan.

That does not apply to Ni Putu Warniasih. She is a mother of three. Two of her three children are in elementary school. That condition creates the needs to cover school tuitions in addition to the living costs. One of her obsessions is to have the children to get the highest education possible so they can transform their life to be better than their parents. Although her husband is selling vegetables door to door, Ni Putu Warniasih does not want to sit around and do nothing. Utilizing a small lot in her yard, she and her husband made a small shed with three compartments. The first compartment is to grow the piglets, the second compartment is for the sow and the third compartment is for breastfeeding. With the loan from Dinari, Ni Putu Warniasih can buy a sow that will soon deliver the piglets which will then occupy the shed. She plan on harvesting every three months. She decides to do so to get a fast turn around to allow her to use the profit for additional capital and to help cover her family's living expense. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nDi adat Bali kuno, seringkali muncul pemahaman bahwa wanita hanya diam dirumah untuk merawat anak dan melayani suami. Namun, hal itu tidak berlaku bagi Ni Putu Warniasih. Ni Putu Warniasih adalah ibu dengan 3 orang anak. Dua dari tiga anaknya sudah mengenyam pendidikan di bangku Sekolah dasar ( SD ). Kondisi seperti itu tentunya membutuhkan banyak biaya, baik untuk kebutuhan sehari \u2013 hari atau biaya sekolah. Satu keyakinan Ni Putu Warniasih adalah ia berkeinginan anaknya dapat menempuh pendidikan setinggi mungkin sehingga mereka akan dapat mengubah hidupnya menjadi lebih baik atau menjadi lebih baik dari orang tuanya. Walaupun suaminya berprofesi sebagi pedagang sayuran keliling, hal itu tidak membuat Ni Putu Warniasih berdiam diri saja. Dengan memanfaatkan sepetak tanah dibelakang rumahnya, Ni Putu Warniasih dengan suaminya membuat sebuah kandang dengan 3 ruangan. Ruangan pertama untuk anak babi yang digemukkan, ruang 2 untuk induk dan ruang 3 untuk induk yang menyusui. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Ni Putu Warniasih membeli induk babi yang sudah dikawinkan. Perhitungannya induk babi itu akan segera melahirkan anak dan segera mengisi kandangnya. Ni Putu Warniasih berencana memelihara babi untuk babi guling yang dipanen 3 bulan sekali. Hal itu dipilihnya karena perputaran modalnya cepat, sehingga Ni Putu Warniasih bisa menyisihkan untuk modal dan kebutuhan sehari \u2013 hari. Dengan kegiatannya sekarang, Ni Putu Warniasih mampu membantu keuangan keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":71498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase sows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-04T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu Warniasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-19T01:00:27Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":175,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T01:57:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70369,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86641,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:52:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100300,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119103,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139690,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164710,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T08:04:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779,"comment":null},{"amount":11,"local_amount":11,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T01:22:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225233,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T01:25:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259338,"comment":null},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300483,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-25T07:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331172,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-31T07:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365243,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-05T01:00:27Z","paid_date":"2008-10-31T07:16:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20116,"name":"Ahammd Sadiq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahammd Sadiq lives in District 6 of Kabul, Afghanistan.
