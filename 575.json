Constantemente viaja a la ciudad de Tarma, donde vende frutas al menudeo, pues en la sierra del pa\u00eds no se encuentran estas frutas, por ello en cada viaje que realiza le brinda buenas ganancias. Asimismo se dedica a la crianza de animales menores como gallinas, patos y cuyes, que tambi\u00e9n son animales muy escasos en la selva central, por ella la venta de carne de estos animales obtiene regulares ganancias mayores al dinero invertido. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta, es \u201ctrabajar\u201d, pues le gusta mantenerse ocupada, es por eso que ahora tiene planeado sembrar mango, con lo que podr\u00e1 variar la venta de diferentes frutas.

She travels constantly to the city of Tarma where she sells fruit retail.  The type of fruit she sells is hard to find in the mountain area so she makes a good profit everytime she travels there.  \r\n\r\nShe also raises small animals such as hens, ducks and guinea pigs, which are also scarce in the central forest.  Income on sales of these types of animals is greater than money invested.

She says few people grow this type of fruit and the ripening and harvest season are once a year so the market price is high.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank, \"Las brisas\".

She lives in a house that is her own, together with her husband Roberto, 54 years old, and their 3 grown children. For the past two years she has had a produce business, selling from a stand in her neighborhood market. It is located thirty minutes away, by car. In order to acquire the produce and tubers that she needs, she sets out at 4am to the wholesalers market in Lima (La Parada), where she makes her purchases in wholesale. At 7am she arrives at her stand and she sells until 2pm with her daughter\u2019s help.  This is how Bernardina is able to acquire good earnings, with which she is able to pay the rental fee of her stand without any problems.  She loves her business, especially when the stand is stacked with fresh vegetables and tubers.

During the afternoon she provides public transportation services with her mototaxi, a vehicle that consists of a motorcycle with an attached cabin used to move people from place to place.  With these activities she\u2019s able to help her husband cover family expenses.\r\n\r\nShe will use part of the loan to increase her corn husk sales with the purchase of more merchandise.  She also needs to maintain her vehicle in good working order to continue providing good customer service.  Because of this, she has deemed it proper to request a 1000 new sol loan from Edpyme Alternativa.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":745532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"  to repair her mototaxi and to buy more corn husks to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-04-07T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lindaura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72.21},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":86.77},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":92.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":98.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.91},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.46},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.86},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.23,"local_amount":69.95,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":73.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206138203,"comment":null},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":72.21,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":75.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210763,"comment":null},{"amount":26.91,"local_amount":71.75,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":75.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489018,"comment":null},{"amount":29.46,"local_amount":78.56,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":82.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205197,"comment":null},{"amount":29.48,"local_amount":78.62,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":82.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181940,"comment":null},{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":80.56,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":84.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232778935,"comment":null},{"amount":31.92,"local_amount":85.12,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":89.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583525,"comment":null},{"amount":32.54,"local_amount":86.77,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":91.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244541783,"comment":null},{"amount":141.17,"local_amount":376.46,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":395.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752407,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T12:24:14Z","paid_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288213,"name":"Jonhy Richar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johny es padre de casa de 30 a\u00f1os de edad.

Teresa de Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez is a member of the group.  She is 56 years old and didn't attend school.  She has one son.  Teresa has been selling cosmetics and tamales for 30 years.  She is requesting this loan to buy merchandise.  Her customers say that they like to buy from her because she is very hard working and kind to everybody.  Whenever they have a problem they ask her point of view because of the experience that she has.  At the time of requesting this loan, Teresa feels very happy and has a great desire to work.  She requested this loan to buy more merchandise such as beauty products and also corn for making her tamales.  She needs both of her jobs because she can't cover her family's expenses with just the one.  Her customers make a lot of orders and sometimes she doesn't have enough money to buy everything.  Teresa hopes that she will be able to provide a better education for her son since she never received an education

Now she lives with the oldest, Paul, in his house which is located in the city of Santa Ana in the central Peruvian rainforest. \r\n\r\nShe works in agriculture and plants two hectares (20,000 square meters) of agricultural land which she inherited from her mother with a variety of citrus fruits including oranges and tangelos as well as coffee, products that she sells in the city of La Merced. Her work requires a great deal of physical work so she contracts with agricultural workers to help her with the effort. At the same time she works as an administrative person at a state school, a job she has had for eleven years to the present and for which she continues receiving monthly income. What she likes most about her work is to be able to remain busy especially since she really likes being independent. \"And I can help my older children with the things they need\", she says. \r\n\r\nNow she is preparing for the coffee harvest in the months of June and July. She belongs to the communal bank Los Milagros and this is the eighth loan she has with MFP, where she is very grateful for all the assistance they have provided over the years.

She says that her most difficult challenge is to improve her house.\r\n<p>\r\nKirsy is the coordinator of her group Caminando Con Jesus 3 (Walking with Jesus 3). She began with Esperanza International Dominican Republic because she wanted to improve her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. \r\n<p>\r\nKirsy is excited to be taking out her second loan with Esperanza. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to save for future investments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":745988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

He is married to Antonia, age 40, and they have a three year old daughter named Yasmin.  They live together in their own home in the District of Kimbiri.  Cevero is a mason by profession and learned the trade as a young boy from his parents.  Through his experience, he earned the title of master builder.  He builds houses, bridges, schools, and drainage systems.  Cevero is knowledgeable about building and construction, which helps him obtain contract jobs.  When he acquires municipal contracts, the work usually lasts a year.  His job requires the help of workers, officials, and assistants who are divided by their own ranks.  Juan feels very important in his job because each new assignment puts him in contact with civil engineers.  His greatest challenge is the change of plans that occurs because modifications are almost made constantly, which delays the completion of the project.  His job is profitable and enables him to bill in advance for his services.  However, the loan he is requesting will be used to maintain his cacao and coffee crops that are looked after by workers who are in charge of providing the proper care.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  Cevero knows that this loan will be of great help to his farm work.  He is grateful to the Institution for the support it has provided.

The loan would put fresh life into her business. \r\n\r\nDoris wishes to put the business on a stronger footing, and she hopes that this money will enable her to do that, and at the same time allow her to help her children financially while they are in school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":366.83,"image":{"id":746033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy seafood such as puches, crab, olominas, dried fish, and oysters","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ozatlan, Usulutan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2011-04-20T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Emelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.47,"local_amount":27.47,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":27.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211285658,"comment":null},{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":28.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":28.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216565674,"comment":null},{"amount":61.13,"local_amount":61.13,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":61.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221735414,"comment":null},{"amount":62.15,"local_amount":62.15,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":62.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866813,"comment":null},{"amount":147.06,"local_amount":147.06,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":147.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257264816,"comment":null},{"amount":40.7,"local_amount":40.7,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263406131,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-21T16:53:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288399,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":354.45,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy dress shoes, runners, and sandals.

This gentleman strives to succeed in life.  He is married to Virginia, age 35, and they have three children with whom they live in their own home.  Juan is the breadwinner of their family.  As a young boy, he learned from his parents how to work on a farm.  He is now a farmer and has three hectares of land on which he grows cacao and coffee, which are native plants of the Peruvian jungle.  Juan has worked hard on his land for eight years.  During the harvest season, he has the help of his children and of workers who can pick the fruit at rapid speed.  What he enjoys most about his work is harvesting because he feels the months of hard work are rewarded through the quality of his products.  He considers the most difficult part of his job to be transporting his products from the field to the collection centers located in the Districts of Quimbiri and San Francisco.  These places offer the best prices for both cacao and coffee beans.  His greatest challenge is not having enough income to pay his workers in advance so that they can assist him in the fields.  For this reason, he has applied for the loans provided by MFP.  Now his greatest priority is to sow more coffee plants since he has one hectare of land that remains uncultivated.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.  Juan feels that the loans have been a great help in advancing his business.  In his Communal Bank, the other members have great respect for him.  The loan of 2000 PEN that he requested will be used to hire workers who will be able to help him with the coffee harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":746039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire workers for harvesting coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-11T07:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":302.57},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":314.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":325.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":339.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":352.47},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":365.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.03},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.68,"local_amount":302.57,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":308.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196498,"comment":null},{"amount":114.03,"local_amount":314.57,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":320.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270175,"comment":null},{"amount":117.88,"local_amount":325.19,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":331.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550195,"comment":null},{"amount":123.24,"local_amount":339.95,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":346.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718871,"comment":null},{"amount":127.77,"local_amount":352.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":358.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350339,"comment":null},{"amount":132.4,"local_amount":365.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":371.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850829,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-15T19:39:59Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288401,"name":"Francisco Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco, tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Concepci\u00f3n Batres, departamento de Usulut\u00e1n, vive con su esposa y una hija de 3 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l se dedica a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda, aprendi\u00f3 el oficio por su padre, y hoy en d\u00eda este oficio es el que genera las ganancias para sostener a su familia.\nActualmente solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar ganado, el cual comercializara dentro de un tiempo, este negocio le permite obtener de cada venta su ganancia y el valor de los gastos incurridos en el cuido del ganado.\nEspera mejorar el negocio, que las ventas sean provechosas y que su familia cuente con una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"28-year old Francisco lives in Concepci\u00f3n Batres in the department of Usulut\u00e1n with his wife and 3-year old daughter.

At the moment, her greatest priority is to acquire additional farmland so that she can expand her plantings and increase production.  This is her fifth loan with MFP and she is willing to complete all of her payments on time.  Macedonia wants to be able to access additional loans in the future.  She is a well-respected member of her Communal Bank.  The loan of 2000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy cacao plants that she will later plant in her fields in order to take advantage of the abbreviated harvest season.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":746057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase cacao plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-11T07:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Macedonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":302.57},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":314.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":325.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":339.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":352.47},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":365.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.03},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.68,"local_amount":302.57,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":308.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196500,"comment":null},{"amount":114.03,"local_amount":314.57,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":320.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270177,"comment":null},{"amount":117.88,"local_amount":325.19,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":331.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550197,"comment":null},{"amount":123.24,"local_amount":339.95,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":346.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718873,"comment":null},{"amount":127.77,"local_amount":352.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":358.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350341,"comment":null},{"amount":132.4,"local_amount":365.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":371.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850831,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-11T23:40:18Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288407,"name":"Angela Concepcion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngela, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en El Transito departamento de San Miguel, vive con su esposo y tres hijos de 19, 17 y 15 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l se dedica a la venta de frutas y verduras de forma ambulante, no tiene un horario fijo para el trabajo, y actualmente quiere un pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en mariscos, elotes, frutas y verduras.\nLa compra le ayudara a contar con todo lo necesario para le ofrecer a los clientes, comercializando variedad de productos.\nSu sue\u00f1o es establecer un negocio fijo, dejar de ofrecer los productos de forma ambulante y proveer para su familia todo lo necesario para subsistir.\n","en":"Angela is 34 years old and lives in El Transito in the department of San Miguel.

She is a hard-working woman who strives to provide the best she can for her daughter, Briyid, who is 11 years old.  They live together in a rented house in the Kimbiri district.  They used to live in their own home but, because of family problems, had to move out.  Her parents taught her how to work to make a living for herself.  Her business is buying products such as coffee, cocoa, annatto and tumeric, mainly forest area crops, from the indians.  She's been in the business for four years and has the help of workers who load and weigh the items she purchases.  She uses a vehicle to travel around to different communities in search of her products which she then transfers to the well-known co-ops such as \"Cooperativa Agraria\", \"Cacao Vrae\" and \"Machupichu\" who pay her a percentage for each kilogram she delivers.\r\n\r\nHer business is very profitable and she receives an annual premium from the co-ops.  The months of January, February and March are the rainy season and roads are flooded, so during these months she lags behind in her business.  Her plans for the future are to continue working in the same way to provide for her daughter.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used as capital to buy products form the indians.  This is her 11th loan through MFP and she has always paid back the previous loans on time and is committed to doing so this time.  She is well loved in the communal bank by the rest of the members.  The 2000 PEN will be used as capital to buy products from the indians.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":746066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cocoa, coffee, annatto and tumeric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-08T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":302.57},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":314.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":325.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":339.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":352.47},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":365.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.03},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.68,"local_amount":302.57,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":308.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196501,"comment":null},{"amount":114.03,"local_amount":314.57,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":320.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270178,"comment":null},{"amount":117.88,"local_amount":325.19,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":331.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550198,"comment":null},{"amount":123.24,"local_amount":339.95,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":346.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718874,"comment":null},{"amount":127.77,"local_amount":352.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":358.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350342,"comment":null},{"amount":132.4,"local_amount":365.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":371.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850832,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-08T14:19:48Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288411,"name":"Ely Vanessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ely, reside en el departamento Usulut\u00e1n, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su madre y sus hermanos, es madre soltera de una ni\u00f1a de 2 a\u00f1os de edad, administra un negocio el cual comenz\u00f3 con la ayuda de una cu\u00f1ada, su horario de atenci\u00f3n es de 6:00am a 5:00pm, en el negocio ofrece productos de la canasta b\u00e1sica necesarios en todo hogar.\nElla est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en el negocio, comprando mercader\u00eda para ofrecer a los clientes.

Sus productos de cacao y caf\u00e9 los comercializa  en la ciudad de San Francisco y Quimbiri, lugares donde mejores precios le ofrecen por la calidad de sus granos de cacao. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos, ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos. El pr\u00e9stamo solicitado es para la compra de madera y calamina ya que tiene planeado restaurar su vivienda a base de material rustico como madera y calamina. Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es trasladar sus productos desde la chacra hasta los secaderos que est\u00e1n ubicados a 02 horas de caminata. En adelante espera comprar nuevas tierras, para aumentar su producci\u00f3n. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, siente que este aporte le ayudar\u00e1 mucho en el progreso de su trabajo y esta dispuesto a cumplir puntualmente con sus cronogramas de pagos. Agradece a los socios de su banco comunal por permitirle integrarse al grupo. Con los 1,000 nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 madera y calamina, para restaurar su vivienda ya que esta a punto de colapsar.\n\n\n","en":"Sebastian is 36 years old and was born in the city of Quimbiri. He lives together with Marlene, age 28, and from this relationship he has a daughter named Geraldine who is 1 year old. Together, they live in their own house, where harmony reigns. Sebastian is a farmer; he parents taught him this profession since he was a very young boy, and now he has been working his own lands for the past 12 years, growing cacao plants with agricultural technology. During harvest times, he has support from day laborers. He knows very well that the money he obtains comes from the good quality of his harvest. He sells his cacao and coffee in the cities of San Francisco and Quimbiri, places where he is offered better prices thanks to the quality of his cocoa beans. What he likes most about his work is harvesting the beans, because he feels that the months of arduous work are now paying off with a quality harvest. The loan he is requesting is to buy wood and corrugated metal sheets, since he is planning to renovate his home using rustic materials such as wood and metal sheets. He considers the most difficult part of his work to be taking his products from the fields to the drying facilities which are located a 2-hour walk away. In the future, he hopes to buy more land in order to increase his production. This is his first loan with MFP, and he feels that this support will help him greatly in the progress of his work, and he is prepared to be punctual with his payment schedule. He is grateful to the members of his communal bank for allowing him to join the group. With the 1,000 Peruvian new soles he is requesting, he will buy wood and metal sheets to renovate his home, since it is now about to collapse. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":746093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy wood and corrugated metal sheets to renovate his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-10T00:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":151.27},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":157.26},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":162.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":169.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":176.22},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":182.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.73},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.97},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.73},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.73,"local_amount":151.27,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":159.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196503,"comment":null},{"amount":58.97,"local_amount":157.26,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":165.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270180,"comment":null},{"amount":60.96,"local_amount":162.57,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550200,"comment":null},{"amount":63.73,"local_amount":169.95,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":179.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718876,"comment":null},{"amount":66.09,"local_amount":176.22,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":185.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350344,"comment":null},{"amount":68.52,"local_amount":182.73,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":192.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850834,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T04:36:53Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288422,"name":"Flores El Campo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Dorotea Pricilia T.

Armanto began his adventure as a farmer on his parents\u2019 land when he was a boy.  His passion for agriculture took him to acquiring his own land, where he has been working independently for the six years.  He raises cacao, and coffee on 5 hectares.  During the harvest season he hires farm hands who pick the crops with great speed and he is able to get his work done efficiently.  He is very committed to his work because he sees that his efforts pay off when his plants produce a good crop, which generates income for every kilogram he sells.  He says that he does not really like the winters because there are many insects during that time and the rains impede his work and damage his plants.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for this loan of 2,000 PEN so he can buy cacao plants to plant and harvest their bounty in a short time.  He also wants to buy some more land so that he can increase his production.  This will be his first loan through MFP and he is prepared to make all of his payment on time.

She lives in a simple structure with her one of two children, which she raised after becoming a widow. Ana is excited about her second loan with Kiva partner, Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing clothing, cosmetics products, and shoes in the main market in Santiago, and then bringing them back to her community to sell in her home or by walking. She will use her profits to invest in her business. She intends to invest in her home by building a concrete structure in the short-term future and improve her business into a big store.\r\n\r\nHer story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti).

This will make her more income and she will be able to aspire to a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":746258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy paper, detergent, salt, sugar, sweet bread, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Lourdes Col\u00f3n, departamento de La Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-04-12T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":33.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-20T07:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":33.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206733295,"comment":null},{"amount":35.44,"local_amount":35.44,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":35.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211388602,"comment":null},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":36.2,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-18T07:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":36.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216448774,"comment":null},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":38.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":38.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221612832,"comment":null},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":38.63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":38.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226982111,"comment":null},{"amount":40.48,"local_amount":40.48,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T07:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":40.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233430757,"comment":null},{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":42.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238545738,"comment":null},{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":43.77,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505336,"comment":null},{"amount":45.11,"local_amount":45.11,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250712821,"comment":null},{"amount":46.97,"local_amount":46.97,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":46.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257115701,"comment":null},{"amount":98.86,"local_amount":98.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263240840,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-15T20:59:56Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:26:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288477,"name":"Luzminda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luzminda I. is from the village of Tagpako, Gingoog City.

A. is from the village of Canicapan Clarin Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buy and selling RTWs in the local community. Leny has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Leny joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leny is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products like mosquito nets and blankets for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Leny from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 31 years old. Dioleta is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Dioleta owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, junk foods, shampoo, coconuts and green bananas in the local community. Dioleta has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Dioleta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Dioleta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI.  This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  Dioleta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products like canned goods and green bananas. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Dioleta from HSPFI.
