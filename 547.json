She\u2019s married to Teofilo, 58, and they have four children.  They live together in their own house in the community of Pampahuasi in Samugari.  With great effort Ysabel and her husband have managed to till their lands making them very productive. Ysabel grows cocoa beans, coffee and coca leaf which are economically sustainable products.  During harvest time Ysabel has to hire helpers in order to quickly harvest the fruits and transport the heavy sacks from her fields to the community of Pampahuasi.\r\n\r\nShe has been working in agriculture for 35 years and she knows its requirements.  What she enjoys most about the work is caring for her crops since her income depends on them.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to local neighbors. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. Marilyn earns money by purchasing inventory at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors from the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages in order to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes to be able to expand soon.

With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carol has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to save up for the future security of her family and to continue growing her business.

Her husband Wilmer, who is 38 years old, works as an administrator of a fishing boat to earn his living. They have four children who are between 2 and 12 years old. Dareen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Dareen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional capital to save up for the future education of her children and to build their own house. Dareen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is 42 years old, married and supports her family by operating three business ventures: food vending, providing tricycle transportation and selling ready to wear clothing. She lives in E. B. Magalona, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. Shirley is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase raw materials. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Shirley aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Alfredo, who is 58 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 24 and 34 years old. Helen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks for her sari-sari store to continue to save up for future business improvement. Helen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 25,000. Caridad is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase feed and vitamins for the pigs. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Caridad aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 37-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fish vending business. She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 30,000. Carmelita is borrowing PHP 22,000 to fund operations. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Carmelita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Emelita has 10 children who are between 16 and 40 years old. Emelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use as funds for her business operations to continue to save up for future expansion of her business and for family needs. Emelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Julia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Julia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy plywood & fish net for fishing so that she can save up for the future education of her children. Julia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nShirley hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is a married woman who lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: Pig Fattening, Videoke and selling frozen foods. Her husband Rex, who is 50 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have seven children who are between 15 and 28 years old. Genara joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Genara has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Genara is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a business selling fish. Her husband Arnie, who is 39 years old, works as a plumber to earn his living.  They have three children who are 2 to 13 years old. Georgette joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Georgette has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000. She intends to use the loan to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for children's education and family needs. Georgette is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C., 51, is one person who definitely has the motivation to follow her dreams. She finished only high school but is confident that she will become a successful micro entrepreneur. Nicky, as she is called by friends, is married to Emildo, a motorcycle taxi driver. They reside in Parola, Binondo, at the heart of Manila and together they are raising three children. One of them studies in college, another is in elementary school, while the third stays at home.\r\n\r\nNicky has run her own sari-sari (variety) store at home for two years now. She sells goods at a cheap per-piece price to accommodate the immediate needs of her neighbors, such as a sachet of shampoo for an employee who needs to bathe before going to work, or a small amount of salt that a cook needs to season her food. Nicky is also into the buy and sell business. With these, she earns roughly PHP 11,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Nicky has requested a loan of PHP 14,000. With this she plans to buy four sacks of rice, which she will repackage for retail. She also intends to purchase more grocery items to add to the various products on her store shelves. With this loan, she knows she will be able to earn more profits and save more.\r\n\r\nNicky's biggest challenge is that she has lists of debts that her customers sometimes fail to pay because of financial constraints. But being the determined micro entrepreneur that she is, she seeks a solution to this problem. This is all for the purpose of achieving her dream of having a profitable business, a good life, and a sustained education for her children.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":714365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For Ediza R., 41, a poor educational background will not necessarily end in poverty. Ediza did not even reach high school. She is married to Freddie, a factory worker. They have two children, who are both in elementary school. Their family resides in Binondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nTo fight off poverty, Ediza set up a sari-sari (variety) store at their home, by which she also helps her fellow community members by providing them with what they need most: basic toiletries and instant food, among other things. She has been running her sari-sari store for five years now. Aside from that, she also repackages garlic and onions and includes them in her sets of products for sale. These enable her to earn 12,000 PHP monthly. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to request a 16,000 PHP loan. She knows that sufficient finances on hand will ensure that she will have enough products in her store to meet the various needs of her community. Basically, she plans to buy additional products for her store.\r\n\r\nJust like any ordinary sari-sari store owner, it is her struggle to go after customers who do not pay their debts on time. But a strategic microentrepreneur like Ediza finds ways to solve such problems. Ediza is focused on growing her store into a big grocery someday. She desires to prove that her failure in terms of her education will not be experienced by her children, whom she hopes will finish their schooling well.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meetings, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Milyn A.\u2019s Group\".\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Milyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Milyn has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Milyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Milyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Milyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the third taken out by Milyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.

She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,800. Ma. Brenda is borrowing PHP 12,000 to purchase raw materials. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ma. Brenda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Merie Ann has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Merie Ann joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merie Ann has successfully repaid a previous loan  from GDMPC. Merie Ann is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to repair existing engine. This will be the twelfth loan taken out by Merie Ann from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to continue to save up for future business expansion. Vilma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is married to Felipe, a tricycle driver, and mother to their children. By the grace of God, Dolores has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Dolores, as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nDolores operates a charcoal retailing business along with her buying and selling of tropical fruits. She also oversees the tricycle transport business. In the Philippines, many still use the old ways of cooking (on an earthen stove where charcoal is used) to save money. Charcoal is much cheaper than LPG fuel, which, in the current market, costs as much as Php600.   Many people prefer to buy charcoal, which is so cheap that it can be bought for Php5. More people are also switching to firewood, which can be foraged or found in the trash.  Dolores also sells tropical fruits on her stall because they are usually requested by her customers.  Among these three businesses, she earns an estimated net income of around Php9,000 monthly.\r\n \r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of charcoal in sacks to be repackaged and retailed to her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nDolores hopes to be able to see her business mature and grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":714501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more quantities of charcoal in sacks to be repackaged, and also varieties of tropical fruits to add to her current inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-17T22:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2181.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814262,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256827,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123520,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194818,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-17T23:23:47Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":274300,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet I. is from the village of Dban Calamba Misamis Occidental.

Bellaflor has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 15000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bellaflor joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bellaflor has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Bellaflor is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods, junk foods & beverages. This loan will be Bellaflor's 5th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":714518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is married to Josephina B., a housewife, and is father to their children. By the grace of God, Eligio has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to send his children all the way through college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Eligio, as he himself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nEligio operates their jeepney service, which is basically used for public transportation.  He is also a farmer who grows, tends and harvests his own crop from his land. He mostly grows seasonal fruits that are native to the Philippines, like pineapples, which are grown mostly in the south region of Luzon. Also in his product inventory are garlic and onions, tomatoes and other staples for simple cooking recipes. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a small income of around Php400 every day on his jeepney operation.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting a Php9,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizers, seedlings and other farming needs for the crop. He will also use part of this loan to pay for the cost of renewing the registration of his jeepney. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n \r\nEligio dreams to be able to give his children a good and high quality education through all his hard work in his business. He faithfully meets with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns her living by operating a business venture selling fish. Her husband Bernie, who is 43 years old, works as a fish vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 11 and 21 years old. Sonia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sonia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10.000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for fish vending so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children & for house improvements. Sonia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Ayungon, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store and a dried fish business. Her husband Romeo, who is 61 years old, works as a farmer\/carpenter to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children who are 16 and 31 years old. Gleceria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gleceria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 4,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10.000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and to support their daily needs. Gleceria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 28 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruby has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 29th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy items for her store and mineral water so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Ruby is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 30 years old. Rammynel is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Rammynel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling seafood products  including fish like sardines & milk fish aside from having a retail store business in the local community. Rammynel has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2010, Rammynel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rammynelhas successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Rammynel is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell like milk fish & salmon. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Rammynel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 49 years old. Diosa is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Diosa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling hotdogs & sausages from PUREFOODS in the local community. Diosa has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Diosa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Diosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Diosa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, like hot dogs & sausages. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Diosa from HSPFI.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC of 3000 PHP, which was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Elisa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She lives in a traditional family with her children, co-wife, and other relatives in the Bougoufie district of the city of Segou (4th most populous administrative region in the republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nNot having attended school for social reasons, she started a small business early on beside her mother who sold condiments.  After several years of apprenticeship at her side, she went alone to start a business selling fresh fish. It has now been 30 years and she enjoys a great experience and reputation.  The strength of her sales is due to the quality of her fish (large) that is very much appreciated by her customers.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy customer demand, she has been in a relationship with Soro Yiriwaso for the past 24 months.  After two small individual loans, both completely repaid, she is on her third individual loan that she plans to use for the purchase of 200 kg of fish.  She buys locally. Mrs. Minata Soriba C. sells for cash and for credit to male and female customers.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA, which will allow her to repay her loan and feed herself since she is widowed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":714612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  perfumes\/cosmetics sales and fish vending.  Her husband Roland, who is 46 years old, works as a government employee to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 12 to 24 years old. Elisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy perfumes\/cosmetics to sell to continue to save up for future house renovations.  Elisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a vegetable plantation\/farming.  Her husband Ivan, who is 54 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have no children. Helen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for house improvements and prepare for her future.  L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 61-year-old single woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: selling Ready-to-Wear clothes and selling hardware merchandise. She lives in Valladolid, Negros Occidental. Luisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future needs of her family.  R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 45-year-old widow who supports her family by operating three business ventures:  used clothing, Avon & Natasha dealer and a manicure\/pedicure\/weaving business.  She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. Lilian joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilian has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy items for her used clothing business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and to have her own business area. Lilian is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Each of the group's members carries out her own business activity every day in the city of Puerto Plata.  This is a city whose main businesses are tourism and a rum factory.  The property sector is also strong in this city.  These are the main sources of work.  The ladies in this group mainly sell jewelry, clothes, shoes, accessories, cosmetics, food and other miscellaneous products.\r\n\r\nYsabel's family is made up of herself, her husband and her son.  As a mother, she tells us that her greatest difficulty is going out to work and having to leave her son at home alone without her attention.  For this reason, she works in her own business which allows her to spend more time at home looking after her son.  Ysabel's favorite activity is going to church and sharing with her fellow group members.\r\n\r\nYsabel runs a business selling shoes and jewelry.  She saw the need for someone to sell gold jewelry in her community and other nearby communities and she started selling these products gradually.  After having received five loans from Esperanza she is now able to sell shoes as well.  Ysabel will invest this loan in both lines of products, devoting 50% of her loan to each.  She would like to have a stable business, with her own premises, and for it to be sustainable.  One of her future plans is to build these premises as well as her own home.
