With 15 years of experience, she enjoys much fame in this business. She learned the craft with a neighbour. To meet the increasingly significant demand, she decided to take part in the loan program of the Siri Yiriwaso micro-finance institution (with whom she has been working for 2 years) in order to have more financial resources at her disposal. She is on her first individual loan, after having taken advantage of one group loan.\r\n\r\n<p>She supplies herself at the market in Sikasso and in Bouak\u00e9 (a city in the Republic of the Ivory Coast in West Africa) by order 4 times each month. Then she sends the merchandise to her home in Sanoubougou, where she makes her atti\u00e9k\u00e9, using the standard means of transportation. She needs this loan to buy more cassava from which to make lots of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 in order to satisfy her clientele, which continues to grow.\r\n\r\n<p>She runs this business throughout the year without major difficulties. The turnover of her business is very high, and she realizes a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA. Thanks to this profit, Mrs. Safiatou D. helps her husband especially by paying for certain family expenses.\r\n\r\n<p>She finds that the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso helps the poor in getting out of their desperate situation.\r\n\r\n<p>The sum being requested is reasonable given the need.

Despite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country (forgive the label, there remains no consensus on an acceptable definition), it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general. Not just professionals, but grandmas in villages, school kids, street sellers. It can probably be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people, because there are few landlines, and mobile phones are relatively cheap  here.  The mobile phone business is a very good business. Mariam requests a loan to purchase additional stock, such as batteries, cases, and chargers.

Since she doesn't have enough funds to realize her plan, Kurbongul decided to take out a loan for 3 months.    \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0448. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435. \u041f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0445\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0440. \u0422\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u044b.\u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 6 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c  \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0443 \u043e\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432.\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430 ,\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 .\u0422\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442 ,\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443\u043b \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 3 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0430."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":172258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase inventory assortment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vahdat","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T21:10:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kurbongul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T22:15:19Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-10-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-14T07:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":514.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":358401,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T05:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":514.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5340091,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":514.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9962960,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T22:15:19Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T01:54:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":53148,"name":"Kadidia","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"<p>Mrs. Kadidia T. is a 64 year old widow with 9 children living with her in the home of her late husband in the Pelengana Nord district of the city of S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\n<p>She began working in income-generating activities in her youth with her mother.

Indeed, producing palm kernel oil is one of the most common occupations among local women in the town of Obuasi. Even so, she has experienced a decline in her production of palm kernel oil as of late because she has little in the way of working capital to afford a machine to process her oils. Therefore, she is seeking a loan to buy seventy bags of palm kernel and an electric milling machine, which ought to both reduce the need for manual effort in the production process and produce oil in larger quantities. In turn, she feels that this loan will enable her to generate greater income in order to provide food her family and to finance her children\u2019s education. <p>\r\nShe belongs to the community group called \u201cMegyefo Tease\u201d (My Redeemer Lives) Trust Group. In this group, members guarantee one another as social collateral in order to access loans and apply peer pressure to ensure that the group members' loans are promptly repaid."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":172269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To increase her business' production and efficiency by purchasing additional raw materials (i.e., bags of palm kernel) and an electric milling machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Obuasi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.2 -1.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2008-06-18T22:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayeshetu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-03T04:23:48Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":63.16,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285058,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":60,"local_amount":63.16,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":63.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315250,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":60,"local_amount":63.16,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-04T07:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":63.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346815,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":57.49,"local_amount":60.52,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5349399,"comment":null},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9971989,"comment":null},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10235128,"comment":null},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20437368,"comment":null},{"amount":59.4,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27131567,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-06-19T04:23:48Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:58:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":53155,"name":"Shahida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahida baji is the wife of M.

A. is fifty years old.

Normally, she alternates production between the two products: that is, after producing palm oil, she automatically obtains the raw materials to produce palm kernel oil, and so on. In this way, she produces and supplies her oils to food vendors so that they can prepare their meals. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is now seeking a loan to buy more bags of palm nuts and an electric milling machine in order to increase her efficiency and to thereby produce her oils in larger quantities.

Z. is a 62 year old woman, who is a widow and has 4 children. Thanks to her work, she has supported her 4 dear children and their home, and now all of her children are independent. Sharofat is a farmer, and she plants crops like wheat, potato, carrot and other vegetables on her land. She also raises cattle, which she buys as calves at the market for a low price. She then feeds and raises them to then resell at the same market for a more profitable price. Her younger son helps her with the business.

She sews traditional women's clothing. She had been in this business for the past 5 years. Currently, she has only one sewing machine. There is a demand for her products, and that is why she wants to open a mini tailor shop. To do that, she needs to purchase more textiles and an additional sewing machine. This will help her to increase efficiency and, in turn, profits. Hadisa is 25 years old, divorced, and has 4 children. She is the sole provider for her family. For this reason, she needs to develop her business. Moreover, many residents of her town use her services. To achieve her goals, she decided to apply for a loan, which will solve many of her problems. She is planning to pay it off within the next 10 months. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0447\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430

R. lives in the town of Vahdat. She is in the business of food sales. She has been in this business for the past 10 years. She purchases produce from farmers and sells it at higher prices. This business allows her to earn significant profits. However, she does not have enough funds to support larger inventory turnover during the season. For this reason, she often needs to loan money from friends and family. Once Matluba learned about our organization, she decided to seek our help. After obtaining a loan, she will be able to continue and grow her business.

S. lives with her family in the town of Vahdat.  She is 49 years old, married, and has 5 children. Her main occupation is animal farming. She would like to purchase a milk cow so she could provide her family with milk. In addition, she will be able to sell the extra milk to her neighbors. This will allow her to earn additional income and, at the same time, she will help her neighbors, who will have an opportunity to purchase fresh milk at low prices. For this reason, she is applying for a loan, which she plans to repay within the next 12 months.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

R., 38, lives with his wife and three children in Vahdat.  He raises livestock for a living, buying and re-selling cattle.  Mahmadroib would like a loan in order to buy two additional calves.  This way, he can increase his sales volume.  The more calves he has, the more offers Mahmadroib gets at the market.  He can repay the loan within twelve months.  Since his wife does not work, Mahmadroib is the sole breadwinner for his family.  If things go as planned, this loan will improve his family's living conditions. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva

He has six children, and his oldest child is now working in Russia.  However, the family still needs money, so Abdujabor raises livestock as a business.  He purchases calves at low prices and sells them on for a small profit.  Since the earnings from his business are not large, Abdujabor has applied for a loan in order to buy another pair of calves.  This will help him increase his sales volume.  In addition, the calves that he sells provide fresh meat for the local population.

That is why she plans to take out a three-month loan. \r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Russian by Anya Ezhevskaya, Kiva volunteer. <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\n\u0422\u0430\u043b\u0431\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041e\u0439\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0448.\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 44 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435. \u041e\u0439\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043c\u0438.\u0421\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 , \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u041e\u0439\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440. \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438. \u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442   \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438.\u0414\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 3 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0430."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":172679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Increase product line","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vakhsh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.710833 68.831111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T21:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oybonu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T21:37:19Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-10-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-14T07:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":514.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":358408,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T05:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":514.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5340102,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":514.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9962971,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T21:37:19Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T01:54:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":53348,"name":"Sam-Oeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Sam-oeun P., 51, and his wife, Mrs. Phalla Khin, who about twenty kilometers from Phnom Penh, were married in 1985 and have five children, two sons and three daughters.

is a native of the District of Paucarcolla, but for more than 2 decades she has lived in the city of Puno.

Upon seeing that her children were already approaching the conclusion of their secondary school studies and wanting to pursue a professional career, she saw the need to open a secure business that would bring in good income.  In this way, she began travelling sales of API with delicious cheese empanadas, a typical Bolivian dish that Natalia fortunately knows very well how to prepare.   Within a short time after establishing her business, she felt great satisfaction because, thanks to the contributions of all of her family, she was able to establish a regular clientele.  Her customers expressed a desire for greater comfort; for this reason, Natalia's family rented a space where they now offer their delicious sandwiches.

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"This group of women come from Chuichijojche, a community located in the high mountains of the Nahuala municipality, which is covered by plantations of corn, bean, wheat and potato.  Nahuala is know for its winters, where heavy rain and thick clouds fall over the municipality.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Chuichijojche group has been working together for five years.  This creates a very special dynamic within the group, creates an environment of trust, and it also sees to it that the years don't pass in vain.  You notice this trust in the cheerfulness of the group at the repayment meetings.  This positive feeling which is abundant in this group is based in the most essential foundation - the responsibility.  This group has been able to stay together for such a long time because they are responsible women who pay on time.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the group members sell traditional Guatemalan dresses.  They sell fabrics, long skirts, traditional hand-woven and embroidered blouses and hipbelts.  The women sell their goods at the main markets of the plain, such as Solola, Xela and Totonicap\u00e1n.  They already have regular buyers.  A few of them work as street traders or tend to clients in their homes.  The women not only have assigned buyers, but also have craftspeople who sew for them on demand.  Many of them also already have a group of craftswomen they buy from directly.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group members believe that the credit has supported them because they can purchase more typical clothing wholesale and thereby increase their profit.  They all think that without the loan they wouldn't be able to get ahead.  Because of this they are excited about breaking the taboo of coming together for a group loan.\r\n<p>\r\nThe biggest challenge facing this group of women is coping with both their businesses and also their domestic chores.  Many say that looking after their children and husbands and also keeping up with the housework is an additional job.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Chuichijojche group is a cheerful and united group.  They have already made a lot of progress over the last five years and it's because of this that we should support them so that they can continue fighting.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from [Spanish] by [Lisa Ritchie], Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nP>El reto m\u00e1s grande para este grupo de mujeres es el de lidiar con sus negocios y los quehaceres de la casa.

Nahuala es conocida por sus inviernos, donde fuertes lluvias y densas neblinas recaen sobre dicho municipio. \r\n\r\n<P>El grupo Chuichijojche ha venido trabajando junto desde hace cinco a\u00f1os. Esto crea una din\u00e1mica muy especial dentro del grupo, crea un ambiente de confianza, esto se debe a que los a\u00f1os no pasan en vano. Esta confianza se hace notar cuando las integrantes del grupo se r\u00eden constantemente durante las reuniones de repago. Este sentimiento positivo que abunda en este grupo yace en la base m\u00e1s ensencial, la responsabilidad. Este grupo a podido permanecer tanto tiempo juntas porque son mujeres responsables que pagan puntualmente. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las integrantes de este grupo son vendedoras de trajes t\u00edpicos de Guatemala. Ellas venden cortes, faldas largas, huipiles, blusas tejidas a mano y bordadas, rebosos y fajas. Las se\u00f1oras salen a los mercados principales del altiplano, tales como Solola, Xela, Totonicap\u00e1n a vender. Ellas ya tienen sus compradores listos, muy pocas son las que venden de manera ambulante o que esperan a los compradores dentro de sus casas. Las se\u00f1oras no solo tienen su compradores asignados, pero tambi\u00e9n tienen las artesanas que les tejen a su disposici\u00f3n. Muchas, ya tienen un grupo de artesanas que les compran directamente. \r\n\r\n<P>Las integrantes del grupo creen que el cr\u00e9dito las ha ayudado porque ellas pueden comprar m\u00e1s ropa t\u00edpica al por mayor y as\u00ed incrementar las ganancias. Todas piensan que sin el pr\u00e9stamo ellas no podr\u00edan salir adelante. Es por eso que ellas se animaron a romper el taboo de unirse a un grupo de cr\u00e9ditos. \r\n\r\n<P>El reto m\u00e1s grande para este grupo de mujeres es el de lidiar con sus negocios y los quehaceres de la casa.

She has 5 children. 3 of whom are living separately, one of whom is working abroad and the last child is living with her to help her. Her husband is a retired worker with a pension of 80 USD\/month. Not only because of old age but also because her children are not all available to help her, she decides to stop fishing and start breeding pigs. This time, she wants to borrow 375 USD to invest in breeding pigs.

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The woman from the Tzanjay community come from a delightful village located at the banks of Lake Atiti\u00e1n in the bay of San Juan.  It is a very progressive village.  In this you can see beautiful murals, painted by local artists, a small but modern library, clean streets and a central market which has very interesting architecture.  Furthermore, several foreigners have gone to San Juan to invest in different environmental projects which will benefit the community; projects such as low-energy cookers and recycling, among others.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Banco Comunal Tzanjay has been working together for four years.  All this time the same group of women have been applying for loans from The Friendship Bridge.  This institution appealed to them because it doesn't ask for exclusionary prerequisites.  Instead, a group of twenty women, photocopy the applicants' identity documents offers them a relatively inexpensive loan plus advice.\r\n<p>\r\nThis group of woman manage their credit very well.  So that they could apply for this loan as soon as possible, they decided to accelerate the repayment of their previous loan.  The main reason for this loan is the upcoming village fair.  They would like to have capital to invest in their businesses and thus meet the demand that will arise at this event.\r\n<p>\r\nHalf of the group are craftswomen.  They sew beautiful linen textiles, which are used for making \"huipiles\" - traditional backstrap blouses from the Guatemalan plain.  They are also good businesspeople.  The other half of the group have grocery stores, selling ham, noodles, sugar, rice etc.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women say it is thanks to God that their businesses are running well.  The previous loan enabled them to increase their working capital to a point where they always have enough to meet the demand from their clientele.  For example, one woman says that her clientele is still stable, despite the heavy rain which drenched the plain of Guatemala,  The craftswomen who produce textiles and dyes with natural colours say there is a lot of foreign demand for these products, and that it's because of this that their sales are stable throughout the year.  Another said that she has a grocery store, and has been investing the profits in the production of \"hacky sacks\" - small textile balls filled with rice - which are also sold abroad.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women like working in this group because they like the advice, which the credit agency provides them.  They also have fun while chatting with their clients.   However, what's most important for them is that all the clients are courteous.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dream of these women is that their dear bay of San Juan continues developing to the point that it becomes an example to the rest of the neighboring communities around the lake.  They also dream that their businesses grow and that their family situations improve.  Such noble goals should be supported by noble investments.  Think about it!\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from [Spanish] by [Lisa Ritchie], Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres de la comunidad Tzanjay provienen de un hermoso pueblo ubicado a las orillas del lago Atitl\u00e1n, San Juan la laguna. San Juan, es un pueblo muy progresista. En este se puede ver bellos murales hechos por artistas locales, una peque\u00f1a pero moderna biblioteca, calles limpias y un mercado central que tiene una infraestructura muy interesante. Adem\u00e1s, en San Juan varios extranjeros han ido a invertir en distintos proyectos medio ambientales que benefician a la comunidad, tales como cocinas ahorradoras, reciclaje entre otros. \r\n\r\n<P>El banco comunal tzanjay ha venido trabajando juntos desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os. Todo este tiempo este mismo grupo de se\u00f1oras han venido pidiendo pr\u00e9stamos a The Friendship Bridge. Ellas acudieron a dicha instituci\u00f3n porque esta no le ped\u00eda requisitos salvo un grupo de veinte mujeres, fotocopia de su documento de identidad nacional y fotocopia de c\u00e9dula y ha cambio les ofrec\u00eda un pr\u00e9stamo relativamente barato m\u00e1s capacitaci\u00f3n. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras se nota que dominan muy bien el cr\u00e9dito ya que ellas decidieron adelantar el pago de la \u00faltima cuota del pr\u00e9stamo anterior para poder solicitar este cr\u00e9dito lo antes posible. La raz\u00f3n principal, es la feria del pueblo. Ellas quieren tener capital para invertir en sus negocios y as\u00ed aprovechar la demanda que trae dicho evento. \r\n\r\n<P>La mitad del grupo son artesanas. Ellas tejen bellos lienzos de tela que son utilizados para hacer los huipiles, blusas tradicionales del altiplano de Guatemala. Tambi\u00e9n, podemos encontrar comerciantes. La otra mitad del grupo son tienen tiendas de consumo diario. En ellas, las clientas venden jabones, fideos, azucar, arroz, etc. \r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras argumentan que gracias a Dios les va bien en el negocio. El pr\u00e9stamo las ha ayudado a incrementar su capital de trabajo al punto donde siempre tienen lo necesario para satisfacer la demanda de su clientela. Por ejemplo, una se\u00f1ora dice que a pesar de las duras lluvias que han venido asotando el altiplano de Guatemala, la clientela es estable. Las artesanas que trabajan elaborando tejidos y ti\u00f1endolos con tintes naturales dicen que esos productos tienen mucha demanda en el exterior, es por eso que su venta es estable a lo largo del a\u00f1o. Otra clienta, cont\u00f3 que ella tiene una tienda de consumo, pero con las ganancias ella ha estado invirtiendo en la elaboraci\u00f3n de hacky sacks, peque\u00f1as pelotas tejidas rellenas de arroz que tambi\u00e9n se venden al extranjero. \r\n\r\n<P>A las se\u00f1oras les gusta trabajar en grupo porque les gusta las capacitaciones que les da las agentes de cr\u00e9dito, adem\u00e1s de divertirse mucho durante las din\u00e1micas de rompe hielo. Sin embargo, lo m\u00e1s importante es que todas las clientas son cumplidas. \r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de estas se\u00f1oras es que su querido San Juan la laguna siga desarrollando al punto que sea un municipio ejemplo para el resto de comunidades alrededor del lago. Ellas tambi\u00e9n sue\u00f1an con que su negocio crezca y sus familias est\u00e9n mejor.

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The Lucianitas group come come from the Paquip village, which is situated in the municipality of Santa Clara.  The only way to reach this location is by travelling to the Palestina canton by a microbus, before walking for 45 minutes.  However, when I went there for the interview, I had to walk another 45 minutes in the rain, as the bus driver didn't reach Palestina, and so I had to walk to the center of Santa Clara.  This was an incredible experience, as I was walking through the green mountains surrounded by a deep calm.  \r\n<p>\r\nAll of the Lucianitas manufacture belts from beads.  These belts are used by indigenous women to decorate their materials or long skirts.  The Lucianitas sell the belts to traders who come to Paquip to collect the goods.  Together with their respective families, this group of women work very hard to earn their daily bread.  \r\nEach belt sells at US$6 and it takes one person a whole day to produce one belt.\r\n<p>\r\nThese women usually work alone and are helped by their daughters after they arrive home from school and do their homework.  In Paquip, all girls start producing these belts from the age of 9.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Lucianitas have been working together for 6 years.  During this time, the clients have achieved a unique harmony.  This harmony is due to the courtesy of the women.  Furthermore, all of these years they have felt very comfortable with the credit agent Gloria Cholotio and also with The Friendship Bridge.  They say that they like the Friendship Bridge because an alternative local loan would be very expensive, with monthly fees of up to 10%.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dream of the Lucianitas is to see their childR. complete school and maybe even university.  They all support their childrens' education.  They see that their childR. have the opportunity to get an education that they never had.  It's because of this that they blindly support the development of their families and we really ought to do the same.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from [Spanish] by [Lisa Ritchie], Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las Lucianitas provienen D. la aldea Paquip ubicada en el municipio D. Santa Clara. La \u00fanica manera D. llegar a este lugar es llegar al cant\u00f3n D. Palestina en un microb\u00fas y luego caminar por 15 minutos. Sin embargo cuando yo fui a la entrevista tuve que caminar 45 minutos bajo la lluvia, ya que el conductor D. los microbuses no llegaron a Palestina y tuve que caminar hasta el centro D. Santa Clara. Esta fue una experiencia realmente incre\u00edble ya que estaba caminando al medio D. las monta\u00f1as verdes rodeado por una paz \u00fanica. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las Lucianitas elaboran cinturones a base D. mostacilla. Estos cinturones son utilizados por las mujeres ind\u00edgenas para adornar sus cortes o faldas largas. Ellas venden sus cinturones a los intermediarios que vienen a Paquip a recoger la mercader\u00eda. Junto con sus respectivas familias este grupo D. mujeres trabajan muy duro para ganarse el pan D. cada d\u00eda. Para elaborar un cintur\u00f3n una persona se demora un d\u00eda entero y venden cada uno a US$6. Lamentablemente, el intermediario se lleva gran parte D. la ganancia. \r\n\r\n<P>Usualmente estas mujeres trabajan solas y cuando sus hijas llegan del colegio las ayudan a elaborar las cintas despu\u00e9s D. hacer sus tareas. En Paquip todas las ni\u00f1as empiezan a elaborar estos cinturones desD. que tienen 9 a\u00f1os D. edad. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Lucianitas han venido trabajando juntos por 6 a\u00f1os. Durante este tiempo las clientas han logrado una armon\u00eda \u00fanica. Esta armon\u00eda se debe a que todas las se\u00f1oras son cumplidas. Adem\u00e1s, todos estos a\u00f1os ellas se han sentido muy c\u00f3modas con la agente D. cr\u00e9dito Gloria Cholotio y con la instituci\u00f3n. Ellas dicen que les gusta Friendship Bridge porque un prestamista local les cobra muy caro, esto pueD. llegar hasta un 10% al mes. \r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o D. las Lucianitas es D. ver a sus hijos graduarse del colegio y porque no la universidad. Todas ellas apoyan la educaci\u00f3n D. sus hijos. Ellas sienten que sus hijos tienen la oportunidad D. educarse que ellas no tuvieron o no le ofrecieron. Es por eso que ellas ciegamente apoyan el desarrollo D. sus familias y \u00a1nosotros deber\u00edamos D. hacer lo mismo!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":172892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy beads and

is 27 years old. She is single and lives with her parents. She is the head of a sewing shop. She needs a loan to be able to repair her apartment. Her parents have given her an apartment and she would like to repair it. However, she does not want to take money out of the business because during the past winter there were issues with electricity and it was necessary to close the shop. Guzal let the workers go home because it was impossible to work in the cold and without light. In addition to that most of the sewing machines require electricity. She has already borrowed money before for the business and was able to fully repay the loan.

Thi Tran, 57 years old, joined the Fund in 2003.  Her husband is a government worker in the culture ministry; besides his government work he also has an electronics repair shop at their house.  Due to his many years of experience in electronics repair, his shop is the destination of choice for many families.  The couple has 6 children, 3 of which are grown and live on their own, the remaining 3 live at home.  Joining the Fund gave the family the opportunity to invest more in their livestock business and to buy more electronics repair equipment.  The children are all working and have a steady income to contribute to the family, so borrowing from the Fund and repaying on a weekly basis is a good fit for the family.  In this round of funding Mrs. Tran is requesting 6,000,000 VND to invest in raising pigs.  Their average income is 4,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb N. 57 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng n\u0103m 2003, ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 c\u00e1n b\u1ed9 v\u0103n h\u00f3a x\u00e3 ngo\u00e0i nh\u1eefng c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c t\u1ea1i x\u00e3 ra anh c\u00f2n l\u00e0m ngh\u1ec1 s\u1eeda ch\u1eefa \u0111i\u1ec7n t\u1eed t\u1ea1i nh\u00e0, c\u00f3 nhi\u1ec1u n\u0103m kinh nghi\u1ec7m trong ngh\u1ec1 n\u00ean c\u1eeda h\u00e0ng s\u1eeda ch\u1eefa nh\u00e0 anh lu\u00f4n l\u00e0 \u0111\u1ecba ch\u1ec9 c\u1ee7a c\u00e1c gia \u0111\u00ecnh c\u00f3 nhu c\u1ea7u s\u1eeda ch\u1eefa, ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 6 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con, 3 con \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh v\u00e0 ra \u1edf ri\u00eang, 3 con  \u0111ang \u1edf c\u00f9ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 vay v\u1ed1n gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i v\u00e0 mua \u0111\u1ed3 linh ki\u1ec7n \u0111i\u1ec7n t\u1eed, c\u00e1c con ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 \u0111i l\u00e0m v\u00e0 c\u00f3 thu nh\u1eadp \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111\u1eb7n ph\u1ee5 gi\u00fap gia \u0111\u00ecnh, vay v\u1ed1n c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 v\u1edbi ph\u01b0\u01a1ng th\u1ee9c tr\u1ea3 theo tu\u1ea7n l\u00e0 ph\u00f9 h\u1ee3p v\u1edbi gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb.

In every round of funding, she put the loan towards the livestock business.  Although the family\u2019s livestock venture is not very big, it still brings them a steady annual income.  Besides raising livestock, in her free time Mrs. Tran weaves baskets to sell for extra money.  She has four children, one of which is grown and has established his own family and three who live at home.  All her children have jobs and stable incomes; with these multiple incomes the family\u2019s ability to repay the loans is very good.

Thi Vien, 24 years old, joined the Fund in 2004.  Her family lives near the ocean so their primary source of income is from fishing.  Although the fishing profession is unpredictable, their income is still high.  In the first rounds of funding the family used the loan to invest in fishing equipment, and since it was and is their biggest source of income, the investments have brought many favorable changes to the family.  Besides the fishing business, the family also works the fields and participates in livestock raising cooperatives.  The couple has one small child.  In this round of funding Mrs. Vien is requesting 6,000,000 VND to invest in more fishing equipment.  Their average income is 3,500,000 VND a month.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Vi\u00ean Th\u1ecb Tu\u1ea5n 24 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng n\u0103m 2004, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb s\u1ed1ng  g\u1ea7n bi\u1ec3n n\u00ean ngu\u1ed3n thu nh\u00e2p ch\u00ednh c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 l\u00e0m ngh\u1ec1 \u0111\u00e1nh c\u00e1, tuy ngh\u1ec1 \u0111\u00e1nh c\u00e1 v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3 nh\u01b0ng thu nh\u1eadp c\u0169ng cao, c\u00e1c v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n vay gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o mua s\u1eafm \u0111\u1ed3 ngh\u1ec1 \u0111\u00e1nh b\u1eaft c\u00e1, anh ch\u1ecb sinh \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c 1 con hi\u1ec7n ch\u00e1u \u0111ang c\u00f2n nh\u1ecf, ngo\u00e0i c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c \u0111\u00e1nh c\u00e1 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb v\u1eabn l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng v\u00e0 k\u1ec7t h\u1ee3p c\u00f9ng ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 nhi\u1ec1u v\u00e0o ngh\u1ec1 \u0111\u00e1nh b\u1eaft c\u00e1 t\u1eeb \u0111\u00f3 c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c \u0111\u00e1nh b\u1eaft c\u00e1 c\u0169ng l\u00e0 ngu\u1ed3n thu nh\u1eadp l\u1edbn nh\u1ea5t c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb, v\u1edbi ngu\u1ed3n thu nh\u1eadp h\u00e0ng ng\u00e0y gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 nhi\u1ec1u thay \u0111\u1ed5i.

His neighbors offered to sell him a calf at a very low price, that's why he decided to take out a loan and buy the calf, so that the neighbors wouldn't sell it to someone else. This deal will be very profitable for his business and will bring in the necessary income.

A. lives in the Gissar area. She works as a teacher at the high school number 8 of the Gissar region. Other than teaching, Hurmat has been engaged in the trade of fruits and vegetables for 25 years. She brings the goods, buying them from wholesale traders, and then she sells them at the Gissar market. To increase profit, Hurmat has decided to raise the commodity circulation by receiving a loan. She plans to extinguish the loan within 12 months. Hurmat is married and has five children. Since her husband does not work anywhere, it is necessary for Hurmat to work a lot to provide food for her children.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva
