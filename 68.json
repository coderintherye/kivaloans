One of the most widely spread meals, called \u201cplov,\u201d is made with rice. Plov is cooked very often; you can hardly find any family occasion that can be conducted without that delicious meal. There are various types of plov, and each depends upon the meat and the rice that are used for cooking.

Da Graca","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Lidia da Graca is single and has a 4-year-old child. She does not live with the father of her child because he has a wife and children. She ended her relationship with him because he would not take her on as his wife. Besides her son, Lidia also has a nephew living with her, who is her younger sister\u2019s son. <p> Lidia lives in Inhamissa, a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city of Xai-Xai. <p> Lidia is on her 3rd loan. Because she lives in a somewhat rural area, she was not attracting as many customers as she would like. So she decided to begin another business selling beauty products such as jewelry, perfume, gloss, lipstick, eyeliner, etc. This new business has drawn many clients. For that reason she will temporarily stop her hair salon business so that she can invest most of the money from the loan in purchasing beauty products, since it brings in more profit. Lidia purchases her products in the neighboring country of South Africa twice a month, because such products are cheaper there than in Mozambique. She spends 9,000.00 MT on purchases and about 450 Randes for each round trip. <p> Lidia takes her beauty products from place to place where most of her customers are. She sells her products on credit, and then collects the debts at the end of each month. However she faces some problems in this process because not all the customers pay on the agreed-upon dates. These late payments affect her planned buying trips to South Africa, which many times she has had to postpone for one or two weeks. But she has slowly been able to get around this problem due to the loan granted by Kiva through FDM. She has paid off her FDM loans in a timely manner, and now wants to take out another one. <p> Lidia sees many positive changes in her life. She plans to open a small boutique where she can sell her products without having to circulate from place to place. She also thinks about improving her house. Lidia says one day she might marry a man if he agrees to live with her and take on her son. But otherwise she prefers to live alone. <p> <b> Translated from Portuguese by Jill Haring, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>Lidia da Graca e solteira mas tem um filho de 4 anos. Ela nao vive com o pai de seu filho porque este tem esposa e filhos.Ela ja terminou o relacionamento com ele, porue nao a quis assumir como esposa.Para alem do filho ela vive com o sobrinho, filho de uma irma mais nova.Ela vive em Inhamissa um dos bairros perifericos da cidade de Xai-Xai.Lidia da Graca esta agora no terceiro ciclo de emprestimo. Pelo facto de ela viver numa zona um pouco rural. ela nao consegue ter tantos clientes como seria de desejar. Assim sendo ela resolveu iniciar um outro negocio que e o da venda de artigos de beleza a saber, joais, perfumes, vernizes, batons, lapis de sombraetc. Com este novo negocio ela conseguiu angariar muitos clientes. Neste contexto ela diz que vai parar por uns tempos com o salao de cabeleireiro. Assim a maior parte do emprestimo sera investido na compra de artigos de beleza, porque  e o negocio que esta a render-lhe mais.Ela adquir os produtos de beleza num Pais vizinho a Republica da Africa do Sul. Ela viaja duas vezes por mes para a compra destes produtos por serem mais baratos naquele Pais do que no nosso. Ela gasta 9.000,00 Mt na compra destes produtos e paga pelo transporte de ida e volta por cada viagem cerca de 450 Randes.Estes artigos de beleza ela os vende de reparticao em reparticao onde estao a maior parte dos seus clientes. Ela faz a venda dos artigoa a credito e no fim do mes ela faz a cobranca dos valores em divida. So que neste processo ela enfrenta alguns problemas pois que nem todos os clientes pagam nas datas acordadas. Isso tem reflexos no seu programa de viagens, pois que muitas vezes tem de adiar a viagem para a RSA por uma ou duas semanas porque algumas clientes so pagam uma ou duas semanas depois da data acordad. Mas aos poucos ela esta conseguindo contornar isso devido ao emprestimo que lhe foi concedido pelo KIVA atraves do FDM.Ela reembolsar ao FDM todo o dinheiro dentro da do prazo que foi acordado. Assim ela quer obter um outro emprestimo. A sua vida esta a registar muitas mudancas positivas.

Intially Valina\u2019s husband was FDM\u2019s client, but they decided that the husband should leave the business to Valina so he could take on the job as a truck driver. So, Valina has run the business since March 2007 and the business has grown. She has already repaid her first 9-month loan taken out in March, and now she wants a second one. She is an honest person and has always made her payments on time. Many things have changed in Valina\u2019s life. She had such good results from the first loan that that she was able to open another stand for selling staple goods, improve her home, and says that she is really happy for having received the loan. If the business continues to do well, she and her husband plan on building a better quality home. Valina\u2019s children, except the youngest one, are in school, and if everything goes well with building their house, the couple plans on legally marrying. <p> <b> Translated from Portuguese by Jill Haring, Kiva Volunteer. <b\/><p> Lidia nao casou oficialmente , mas vive com um homem com quem tem 3 filhos.

In 1992, she borrowed 20 USD to buy pigs. By doing business on pigs, her family life became better. Then, she used other borrowed money to invest in breeding poultries. In 2000, unfortunately, her husband passed away. Since then, her life became very difficult. Yet, being hard-working, she overcame the difficulties to raise her children to maturity. In 2004, her oldest son got married and is living separately. Since joining the TYM Fund, she is very reliable and is promoted to become the Local Manager by other women. Her current activity is selling groceries like fruits, candies, dried food. She wants to borrow 950 USD to buy more merchandises.

After a while, she believed she could do it. She talked to her husband and joined the Fund in 1996. The first time, she borrowed only 30 USD to buy 3 pigs. Then, her family earned a decent amount of money from selling pigs. Being confident, she continued to improve her pig-breeding plan and as a result, her family started to have a better life. In 2000, she expanded her pig-breeding plan into breeding poultries, pigs, hens, and her income increased day by day. In 2005, she and her husband decided to send their oldest child to a vocational school and he\/she now is working abroad. In her breeding farm, there are always 6 pigs, 700 hens and 1000 chickens. This is a great source of food for local residents to prepare for the upcoming Tet holiday. Her family current income is 420 USD\/ month. She is borrowing 1200 USD from the Fund this time to buy more chicken and pig-feed. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nKhi Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng tri\u1ec3n khai ho\u1ea1t \u0111\u1ed9ng t\u1ea1i th\u00f4n B\u1eafc H\u1ea1 n\u0103m 1995 \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 r\u1ea5t nhi\u1ec1u ch\u1ecb em tham gia vay v\u1ed1n, nh\u01b0ng ch\u1ecb Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb T\u1ea5c c\u00f2n \u0111\u1eafn \u0111o suy ngh\u0129 vay v\u1ed1n l\u00e0m sao \u0111\u1ec3 ph\u00e1t huy \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3 \u0111\u1ed3ng v\u1ed1n v\u00e0 h\u00e0ng tu\u1ea7n ho\u00e0n tr\u1ea3 cho t\u1ed1t.

M. is 52 years old, has finished high school, is married and has 5 children. Shamigul has been embroidering and selling Tajik folk costumes for the last 8 years. She is planning to use the loan to purchase necessary embroidery supplies for her business. This loan will provide the locals with a source of hand-made folk costumes, since it is increasingly difficult to find high quality work like this. Locally, national Tajik costumes are in high demand, since they are used in weddings and other traditional ceremonies. Mrs. M. is planning to pay back the loan in the next 10 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

integrated by eighteen women. All the women in this group show an incredible willpower, they are cheerful and extroverted. They all work in the town of Panajachel where they bring happiness to the community whilst they work in their different activities. <p>\r\n\r\nThe women in the group are very happy because they will receive the first loan in their lives. With it, they hope to see their businesses flourish and consequently improve their standard of living.\r\nEven though this is their first loan, all of them have ventured to ask the highest amount that can be given as an initial loan (263USD per person). They are proud of themselves because it is the first time that someone, in this case Friendship Bridge and Kiva, are betting on them and believe in their capabilities. <p>\r\n\r\nMost of them will use the loan to buy and then sell clothing (both new and used) at the market or in the streets. Some will use it to buy ingredients in order to prepare food that they will sell during lunch and diner time. Others will use it to buy and sell jewelry and cosmetics. Finally, one of them is a midwife and she will use the money to buy medicines. <p>\r\nThe midwife is the town's doctor and she takes care of the deliveries, mostly those of indigenous women. Moreover, she also assists with other sicknesses. <p>\r\n\r\nMany of them dream of having their own shops so they don\u2019t have to be street vendors. Others want to pay their first loan in order to show themselves that they are capable of having a good business. <p>\r\nThey all dream of having sound businesses that will allow them to count on a steady income and of course, they all dream about the general wellbeing of their families and community.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe women of the group \u201cBrisas del lago Panajachel\u201d only need an initial support so they can move forward, please help them with this credit and they will not let you down.

A pesar de que este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo, todas las integrantes se van a aventurar a pedir la cantidad m\u00e1s alta que se puede otorgar en un cr\u00e9dito inicial: US$263. Ellas est\u00e1n orgullosas de si mismas ya que por primera vez alguien, Friendship Bridge y Kiva, est\u00e1 apostando por ellas y creen en sus capacidades. <p>\r\n\r\nLa mayor\u00eda van a pedir pr\u00e9stamos para la compra y venta de ropa nueva y usada en el mercado o de manera ambulante. Otras van a pedir para comprar insumos para la venta de almuerzos y comidas. Tambi\u00e9n, hay clientas que venden joyer\u00eda y cosm\u00e9ticos. Finalmente, en el grupo hay una comadrona que va a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar medicinas. La comadrona es la doctora del pueblo que se encarga de los partos de las mujeres ind\u00edgenas en este caso. Adem\u00e1s de asistir con otro tipo de enfermedades. <p>\r\n\r\nMuchas de ellas sue\u00f1an con tener un local propio ya que venden sus productos como ambulantes. Otras quieren pagar su primer pr\u00e9stamo para poder demostrarse a si mismas que son capaces de tener un buen negocio. Tambi\u00e9n sue\u00f1an con tener un negocio estable a lo largo del tiempo para que puedan contar con un ingreso estable. Por supuesto sue\u00f1an con tener un bienestar general para su familia y su comunidad. <p>\r\nLas brisas del lago de Panajachel solo necesitan un apoyo inicial para poder salir adelante, ap\u00f3yenlas con est\u00e9 cr\u00e9dito y ellas no les fallaran.

V., who is 40, is not married, and has 2 children. Mavluda is in the business of selling clothes on one of the markets in the town of Vahdat. She has been doing that for the past 4 years. She plans to use the loan to increase the assortment of her inventory. This loan will permit her to increase the inventory turnover rate, which in turn will help her to increase profits that will be used to pay off the loan and support her family. This makes a difference because she is a single parent who upbrings 2 children. Mavluda will be paying off the loan within the next 6 months.   \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

Kalandarov, who is 40 years old, has a Bachelors Degree in education, is married, and has 7 children. M. is currently working in a middle school \u2116 29 in the town of Yavan. He owns some land right next to his house that he wants to use to grow wheat. He has been planting wheat there for the past 15 years. Using the loan, he is planning to purchase seeds for planting on his land. He will sell part of the crop to local residents and leave the rest for himself. This will also give an opportunity to the people from his town to purchase wheat seeds at a price lower than on the markets. In that region, seeds are in demand because they are commonly grinded and further used in baking bread for individual consumption. M. is planning to pay off the loan during the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

R. is 36 years old, has a college education, work as an instructor at the Tajik National Teaching University, is married and has 1 child.  Holmahmad has a small plot of land next to his house.  He would like to get a loan to purchase wheat seeds because their price is much lower now than it will be in one month.  He has been planting wheat for 10 years.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Holmahmad to purchase wheat for planting, plant his land, collect a harvest and use the wheat to make flour and bread for personal use.  A bag of flour costs much more at a store and Holmahmad\u2019s teaching salary is often not enough to pay for it.  He will pay back the loan by using part of his salary.  Holmahmad plans to pay back the loan over a 12 month period.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432

T. is 30 years old, has a high school education, is married and has 4 children.  Toshgul has a small plot of land next to her house.  She would like to use the loan to purchase seeds for planting wheat as they are currently cheaper than they will be in one month.  She has been in this business for 5 years.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Toshgul to purchase wheat for planting, plant her land, collect a harvest and use the wheat to make flour and bread for personal use.  A bag of flour costs much more at a store.  Toshgul plans to sell part of her harvest in order to pay back the loan.  She will pay back the loan over a 12 month period.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0422\u043e\u0445\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430

A. is 56 years old and has a college degree in education. He is married and has six children. Kuvvat currently works as a teacher in the local school in the Yavan region.  To supplement his salary he has also been raising cattle for sale for the last 15 years. Kuvvat is planning to use the loan to purchase cattle for fattening. Every 40-45 days he will sell the animals and purchase new calves. He will use the income from the animal sales to support his large family, since the salary of a teacher is not always enough. Kuvvat is planning to pay back the loan in the next 18 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432

He plans to use the loan to buy wheat seeds for sowing of his land. After the harvest he will keep a part of it to make flour and bread and the rest of it will sell to the locals at the below market price.

U. is 38 years old, has a professional degree in accounting, is married and has 4 children. Mr. U. works in the regional center for disease control. He also has a plot of land alloted to him by the farmers co-op (kolchoz) on which he plants wheat every year. He has 15 years experience with growing wheat. He is planning to use this loan to purchase wheat seeds to plant his land. After the harvest he will keep some of the grain for milling into flour and baking bread, while he will sell the rest to the local residents at a price below the market value. Local residents will be able to purchase wheat for making flour. Mr. U. is planning to pay back his loan in the next 10 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0423\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432

the fund. She borrowed her first loan of 20USD to raise few pigs. Her pigs raising business prospered, next rounds of loan she applied to the maximum limits. She always maintains 7 or 8 pigs ready for slaughtered in her inventory. In 2000, she sent the oldest son to a mechanical school. Upon his graduation she invested 2000USD to open a shop for him. Her youngest daughter is still in school. The family\u2019s economy is adequate. Besides raising pigs and farming the family\u2019s rice paddy, she sells scrap material. Subsequently she built a scrap material processing plant. The plant is prosperous and employs 15 workers with monthly salary of 50USD per employee. The net profit is 380USD a month. This time she would like to apply for a loan of 1200USD to finance her business. \r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/>\r\n\r\n\r\nN\u0103m 1994, khi Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng v\u1ec1 \u0111\u1ebfn x\u00e3 Ti\u00ean D\u01b0\u1ee3c, ch\u1ecb Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb O., 45 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t trong nh\u1eefng ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean tham gia v\u1edbi Qu\u1ef9. \u0110\u1ea7u ti\u00ean ch\u1ecb vay m\u1ee9c v\u1ed1n 20USD \u0111\u1ec3 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i l\u1ee3n. \u0110\u01b0\u1ee3c c\u00e1i duy\u00ean m\u00e1t tay, ch\u1ecb ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i r\u1ea5t ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n.

M. is 31 years old and has a secondary education. He is married and has three children. Usmonali raises livestock. He has been raising livestock for 2 years. He also has a small plot of land that he wants to plant wheat on. He will use a portion of the loan to purchase fuel for his tractor so he can plow the fields before he plants wheat. He wants to use the other portion of the loan to purchase food for his livestock as they cannot graze during the winter. He is planning to sell the wheat to local residents who would have a chance to purchase wheat at lower prices to make flour for bread. Usmonali plans to repay his loan within 10 months. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jamilya & Keith Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0438\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0435\u0432

She joins the TYM Fund in 1999. In the first few years she borrowed money to invest an animal husbandry, her husband, D\u0169ng, worked as a general laborer to pay the loan weekly. After awhile she started a grocery store. The income from the store is used for the repayments so her husband now can stay home farming and helping in her store. Few years later, the family\u2019s economy is getting better. All children are grown up. She would like to apply for a loan of 1200USD to replenish her store getting ready for T\u1ebft.  \r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;\">From Wikipedia: T\u1ebft Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00e1n, more commonly known by its shortened name T\u1ebft, is the most important and popular holiday and festival in Vietnam. It is the Vietnamese New Year which is based on the Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar. The name T\u1ebft Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00e1n is Sino-Vietnamese for Feast of the First Morning, derived from the H\u00e1n n\u00f4m characters \u7bc0\u5143\u65e6. In modern Chinese, the characters for Nguy\u00ean \u00d0\u00e1n (\u5143\u65e6) have evolved to refer to New Year in the Gregorian calendar, that is, January 1.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/> \r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb H\u01b0\u1eddng, 50 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 2 con t\u1ea1i \u00dd Y\u00ean, Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh.

Her husband brews rice wine and the waste (rice husk, bran), which has good nutrient value, was used to feed the animals. Her last loan was used to build a  Biogas system so nothing gets wasted and she has free gas to use. This enables her to save money which is then re-invested in her business. After a few years of hard work and saving, she has built a 2 storey house worth 15000 USD. Her family living condition has changed for the better.

Being encouraged to join the Fund, and realized that the Fund\u2019s working mechanism was suitable for her family, Mrs. L. joined the Fund. Taking advantage of living near a factory, and being sociable, she switched to selling vegetables and food. Her main customers are the factory workers. She has more and more customers and her income is stable now. Currently, her husband is a motorbike taxi rider, helping her repay the money weekly. Her 2 children are workers. Her family income is 320 USD\/ month. She would like to be a long-term member of the Fund and borrow more money to expand her business, and increases the family income.

When the TYM Fund became active in Tam Hong village, she is one among the earliest members. Realizing the benefits of the Fund, she encouraged other women to join. She has been investing in husking the rice, and then using the bran as pig mash. Her profit from breeding the pigs and husking rice is 1000-1200 USD\/year. Besides, Mrs. S. and her children also collect chickens from other areas and sell them. Her business is going very well, and she has lots of customers. The need for money of her business is so high that she is one among the maximum borrowers of the Fund. Since her business is going well and effectively, she wants to borrow more money to improve the household income.
