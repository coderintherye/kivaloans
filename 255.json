The women all live in traditional extended conjugal families with their brothers, sisters, children, and spouses in the village of SOGOLA, in the town of BOUGOUNI, belonging to the 3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali. \r\n\r\nThese women know one another by ties of marriage.  To maintain their farms better, in order to improve their production, they decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  They are now on their fifth farm loan.  All the preceding ones have been correctly repaid.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, they intend to buy 15 sacks of fertilizer, including 10 sacks of a blend for grains, 5 sacks of urea, 200 kg of peanut seeds, and plowing services to work the fields (namely 4 hectares of peanuts and 3 hectares of corn).  All farm supplies will be purchased at the BOUGOUNI marketplace.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of the planting campaign, the group members plan on a total production of 3 tonnes of peanuts and 9 tonnes of corn.  Home consumption will take up a portion of this production, and the rest will be sold in cash at the BOUGOUNI marketplace in order to allow for the repayment of the loan and for covering certain family expenses.  \r\n\r\nThese women hope to obtain a profit of 350,000 francs CFA at the end of the planting campaign.  The profit will be used towards the costs of raising children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":364397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Planting, farm supplies, and the cost of labor ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia Ali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dandjo                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rachelle               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata  Daouda  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bandjan                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramou Baba    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banan                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Broulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":650000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1450,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":659614.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021344,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-03T14:36:15Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":127156,"name":"Blessing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Blessing sells charcoal at her house.

Damira is the leader of this group. There are women who do not wait until a knight comes to them on a white horse and offers his hand and support. They take life as it is and work hard to provide for themselves. Damira is of this type. At the age of thirty-one, she is not married. She has a father, an old retired man, whom Damira has been taking care of for years. To provide for both of them she works in a market, selling macaroni, buckwheat, rice, vegetable oil, and many other retail consumer goods. Three years ago she made a brave decision to go and work in Moscow, Russia. Being a thrifty person, she saved all her earnings and in the end returned home with pretty good funds. She opened a shop investing 1,600 dollars, bought a car, and celebrated her father\u2019s jubilee. Now her monthly income is around 240 dollars. Damira would like to obtain a loan for purchasing more consumer commodities and sending them to the village. She has big plans for expanding her business. After achieving that, she is going to repair her house, prepare a dowry, and get married. \r\n<p>\r\nDamira\u2019s partners are: Kyalbek, Cholpon, and Alfiya. Kyalbek is thirty-one. He is married and has four children. He prepares shish-kebabs in a caf\u00e9 near a brewery. His wife works as a waitress in the same caf\u00e9. Kyalbek needs a loan to purchase sheep for feeding. \r\n<p>\r\nCholpon is twenty-six. She has a husband and a son. Her spouse works at a construction site, whereas she keeps cows and sells milk and yoghurt. Cholpon wants to sell more milk, so she hopes to obtain a loan for buying one more cow. \r\n<p>\r\nAlfiya is thirty-one. She is married. Even though she has two small kids, she has to work to help her husband support the family. She sells underwear, women\u2019s clothes, skirts, and pants. She needs a loan to purchase more clothing and also purchase provender for chickens and ducklings.\r\n<p>\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3 Ps concept&#8212;People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and society as well), Profit (being profitable to grow further), and Planet (taking care of the environment).

Part of this production will be consumed by their families and the rest will be stockpiled and sold wholesale and for cash to the business people of Bougouni. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter reimbursing the interest on the loan, the group expects to have a profit of 150,000 F CFA at the end of the growing season, which will be used to raise goats. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":364422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of seeds and agricultural inputs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata Moussa        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Adama            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teje                                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Tiecoumba     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanco                                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Fousseni                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sounounkou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":330000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":330000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":330000,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":341179.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021346,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-01T20:29:57Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":127169,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther sells sarongs.

He lives in the Jabbor-rasulov region. Most of the population of the region keep cattle and Rustam also feeds small cattle. Together with his family they keep a herd of sheep and shepherd them on the pasture every day. Rustam feeds the herd for five to six months and sells it on the market. Autumn and winter are the most profitable time to sell sheep, thinks Rustam and prepares his sheep for sale. He wants to use our loan to buy another stock of sheep and keep them for the winter.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":364449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"To expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T04:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105850,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022960,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868201,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757397,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146491,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-06T16:44:33Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":127194,"name":"Annah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annah, age 30, is a member of the Tushikamane borrower group in Kola Morogoro.

He has a shop in Wayerma I opposite the Malian Agency for Press and Publicity (AMAP) in Sikasso, not far from the central prison. Mr. K. is much in demand with his clientele for the quality of his products. <P>\r\n\r\nWishing to better satisfy his ever growing clientele, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about two years ago. He is on his second individual loan after having reimbursed the first one without difficulty.<P>\r\n\r\nHe intends to buy 15 lengths of \u201cbazin\u201d (damask), 10 sacks of potash, 15 packets of caustic soda, and 10 boxes of dye of various colors. He will buy these goods in Bamako and then re-sell them to a clientele composed generally of women who do dyeing in Sikasso and surrounding areas, retail, for cash, and sometimes on credit. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 150,000 F CFA which will be used essentially to grow his working capital, help support the family, and pay the interest on the loan, investing any remainder back into his business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She buys the \u201cbazin\u201d, caustic soda and dyes where she lives, and the scarves in Niono (S\u00e9gou region) to order, before dyeing them and then selling them for cash or credit at the truck and bus stop of Sikasso. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 120,000 F CFA which will be used essentially to grow her working capital, contribute to supporting her family, and pay the interest on her loan, investing any remainder back into her businesses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":364470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"purchase of damask for dyeing, light scarves, caustic soda, and dye","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":125099.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112763,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":62549.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028333,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62549.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873660,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":62549.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763370,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-17T10:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":62549.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152193,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":62549.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991082,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62549.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021352,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-02T08:02:05Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":127209,"name":"Pendo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pendo started her own clothing business selling clothes two years ago.

Gloria is grateful for the financial assistance and business education she receives from Manuela Ramos (loan officers from the organization give an educational session at every monthly meeting of each communal bank).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":364524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy staple foods for her restaurant\/catering business and feed and medicines for her farm animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T14:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2100,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":420}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145,"local_amount":420,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":432.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635565,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":420,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":432.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074673,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":420,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":432.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990005,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":420,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":432.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834911,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":420,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":432.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726814,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T20:11:21Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":127249,"name":"La Buena Fe Group 11","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edita O. F. is 20 years old and has just recently opened her own business selling new women's and children's clothing. When Edita first began selling clothing eight months ago, she found it difficult to obtain capital to invest in her business. And so, two weeks ago, she opted to take out her first loan from Kiva and Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nWith this new access to capital and credit, Edita will finally be able to buy larger quantities of merchandise, including women's tops, blouses, and pants and children's clothing. With her new loan, Edita hopes to begin selling women's shoes and sandals as well.\r\n\r\nOnce her loan is fully funded, Edita will travel several hours by bus (called a guagua) to the larger city of Higuey on the eastern coast to buy her merchandise. She will then sell her wares to her neighbors in the Villa Guerrero neighborhood of El Seybo, which lies in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nRevenues from Edita's clothing business will help supplement what her husband earns working for a local construction company, and will also support the family's two children: a 4-year-old son and a 3-month-old daughter.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the family lives in relatively difficult circumstances: they have no electricity in the home, and the 3-month-old girl currently has an untreated skin infection over much of her body. Furthermore, the family, like the majority of their neighbors in Villa Guerrero, is of Haitian descent, which means it is generally more difficult for them to secure economic and political rights as compared to Dominican citizens.\r\n\r\nWith these challenges in mind, Edita recognizes the importance of her clothing business to her family's well-being. She has hopes to keep selling more clothing in the future so that her children may eventually attend school and have better lives.\r\n\r\nHere, Edita is pictured with her fellow borrowers in La Buena Fe (The Good Faith) Bank of Hope, Group 11. She appears second from the left, along with her daughter.

Their granddaughter also lives with them sometimes, since their daughter is independent. For the past two years, Rosa has been selling jewelry by catalog, thanks to her daughter, who introduced her to the business world and encouraged her. Her daughter used to sell catalog jewelry, but as time went by she found more stable work and passed her catalog jewelry business on to her mother. Rosa has fully taken over the business, now, and it is going very well. She is selling more and more merchandise thanks to her cordiality, friendliness, and persuasiveness. The jewelry she sells is of guaranteed high quality and comes bathed in different karats of gold. Rosa really enjoys her work, since it keeps her busy and helps generate some extra income to add to to her husband's earnings. She hopes to increase her income very soon so that she can use the profits to start another business renting out rooms; she's currently fixing up a mini-apartment to rent out. This is her sixth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and she has always made all of her payments very punctually.

She lives in her own home with her husband WIlliam, who is 37 years old, and the couple's greatest goal is to get ahead in life. She has been making bricks for the past 10 years.

She and her husband wake up very early each morning to start mixing and molding the clay, which they then allow to dry for 10 days before firing the bricks. Antonia enjoys selling bricks, since she feels well compensated for her work. She says that the hardest part is working through all kinds of weather conditions, since sometimes the hot sun makes work more tiring, or the rain prevents the bricks from taking the correct shape. Still, she continues to work hard each day to improve her quality of life. In the near future, she hopes to open a small grocery store, since there are very few in her neighborhood.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Julia de su trabajo es realizar el acabado a sus prendas, lleva 20 a\u00f1os en esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda en su sastrer\u00eda. Julia anhela que su negocio crezca con el tiempo y que se convierta en uno de los talleres de confecci\u00f3n m\u00e1s reconocidos de la ciudad de Juliaca. Este es su quinto pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y est\u00e1 dispuesta a pagarlo puntualmente, ya que no desea causarle problemas a las socias de su banco comunal, donde participa activamente. Con los dos mil nuevos soles solicitados comprar\u00e1 nuevos materiales para la confecci\u00f3n de sus prendas.","en":"Julia is 34 years old and is a simple, hard-working woman.  She lives by herself in a house that her parents gave her, since she never married.  What she wants most is to live a quiet life.  The tailoring business runs in her family, as she learned this art from her father when she was still very young.  Her shop is very busy, and her customers line up for her to make them a garment.  Although she has many customers, she works alone because her income still does not allow her to hire an assistant, who would help her make the orders faster.  What Julia likes most about her job is finishing a garment.  She has been doing this for 20 years, and the most difficult part is staying in the tailor shop all day.   Julia is eager for her business to grow over time and to become one of the most recognized tailor shops in the city of Juliaca.  This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she is prepared to pay it on time.  She does not want to cause problems with her partners at the communal bank, where she actively participates.  With the requested $675 (2,000 PEN), she will buy new materials to make her garments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel McRoberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":364570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-07T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641694,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081136,"comment":null},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997286,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842630,"comment":null},{"amount":225.45,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":671.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734205,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She is employed as a teacher.  When she was a little girl, she began working in the sales world by helping in her parents' business of selling vegetables.  Until now, they have preserved that business thanks to the help of Mayra and her brothers, who have learned how to work through their parents.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayra budgets her time well when she travels in her car to deliver vegetables to her clients, such as tomatoes, onions, broccoli, potatoes, cauliflower, and more.  She has certain cities where she delivers the vegetables, such as Pajan, Machalilla, and Puerto Cayo, among others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayra believes her business is very important because through it, she has been able to fund her education.  Although for her brothers, it has not been easy because they had to stop their studies in order to dedicate themselves entirely to the business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conversation with Mayra, you can see that she is a person full of strength with great challenges, and because her desire to work is so strong, she plans to complete a new degree course at the university in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked her how she would invest her loan, and she excitedly responded that she will invest it in more products to supply her business, which includes trips to the cities of Ambato, Guayaquil, and Portoviejo to buy the products she needs.  She will continue selling, without problems, like she was doing before the loan. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayra is happy because she now has her regular clients that wait for her in order to receive her vegetables, which are fresh and ready to eat.  She credits this to her strong confidence in her self to continue helping her parents.  Despite her age, she loves her students and involves herself with them, and she is an excellent teacher.  None of this overtakes her dream of getting farther and obtaining more experience in the business world.<\/p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzy Marinkovich, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":364615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more vegetables to supply her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Mayita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035142,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035143,"comment":null},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947398,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947399,"comment":null},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947400,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789249,"comment":null},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789250,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-01T14:30:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":127281,"name":"Abejitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eulogia C. es la presidenta del grupo \"Abejitas\" que a su vez pertenece al Centro Focal \"German Busch\".

She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tauva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nTauva is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be her 5th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 320 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tolotea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.\r\n\r\nTolotea is now requesting a new loan of 1,250 WST which will again be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be her 3rd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L.

She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 350 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Ruta is now requesting a loan of 1,000 WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. The loan will be her first from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They are from Masatepe Municipality, located in southern Masaya Department. \r\n\r\nMasatepe is a very old city, dating from the pre-Hispanic era, and is one of the so-called Pueblos Blancos (White Villages) or Pueblos Brujos (Witch Villages); the first because there are many white adobe buildings, and the second because some locals still practice traditional indigenous beliefs. \r\n\r\nIn these villages, crafts, flowers, folkloric music and traditional sweets still predominate. This group produces and sells traditional Nicaraguan desserts like rosquillas (a traditional snack made from corn and cheese), pastries, cakes and sweets. However, in order to continue with their businesses, the group members need money to buy the raw ingredients. \r\n\r\nMrs. Julia Argentina C. C. is the group's coordinator; she is 45 years old and has been producing and selling rosquillas for 10 years. She starts making rosquillas at home very early each morning, then goes out to sell them. She needs a loan to invest in raw ingredients (corn, cheese and sugar) to make rosquillas and face the national economic crisis. She wants her business to grow to thus allow her to pay for her children's education. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are: Junieth Jos\u00e9 T.

(0) is a 28-year-old woman living in the town of Vaovai. She is married and has four school-aged children.\r\n\r\nLoluama owns and operates a business raising crops, primarily planting and harvesting taro for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 350 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Loluama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 1,000 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be her first from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. Moelu (0) is a 29-year-old woman living in the town of Vaovai.

She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Grace M. joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nGrace M. is now requesting a new loan of 1,250 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A., Mar\u00eda Teresa Z. M. and Martha Argentina V. G.. They are from Diriomo Municipality, located in the south central part of Granada Department, over a plateau near the base of the Mombacho volcano. \r\n\r\nThe group's coordinator is David Antonio P. A., who is 38 years old. He started selling milk in his community and in Granada from his bicycle about seven years ago. Today, he sells milk and hot milk toddies (a drink made from cinnamon, milk, rum and sugar), which he distributes from his motorcycle. \r\n\r\nHe has worked with Adim perviously, which allowed him to improve his sales, but he still needs to invest a larger sum in his business to buy milk and pinol (a corn\/cocoa-based powder used to make drinks) to later resell. For P., his greatest challenge is expanding his business. His greatest desire is to prosper and to ensure the well-being of his family. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are Mar\u00eda Teresa Z.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":364705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from baking and selling bread to the local community. Marlyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baking equipment. Marlyn is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional cooking ingredients. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business and for her daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

M. is the 42-year-old responsible wife of Mr. Gil M. and a loving mother to her five children who age from 23 to 3 years old. Her husband is laborer while she is a woman who runs different kinds of small businesses. Before she had an access to credit through ASHI, sufficient income to cover all her family expenses and business sustainability were the problems she encountered. These were also the reasons why she had been doing different kind of businesses. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Charmarose decided to join ASHI to address the problems she had. Firstly, she wanted to finance the business she thought best capable of generating a bigger profit. Then, the next problem, which is covering her family expense, would be solved once her business became stable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Charmarose\u2019s first and second loans were used to support her rice buy-and-sell business. She has been able to grow the business and has increased their family income. She was able to payback the loans on time and has been attending center meetings of ASHI on time, too. Every week she manages to save through ASHI for her other personal and family needs.\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, Charmarose is planning to use her loan to purchase a motorcycle as an additional business. Motorcycle-for-hire is one of the most common businesses of people in the municipality of Hamtic where she and her family live. This is the most convenient kind of transportation and people would rather choose it than a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar), since a motorcycle doesn't take long in the parking area waiting for passengers and can easily reach farther and more uphill places which is the typical landscape of the municipality. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Charmarose hopes that her businesses will grow more and that she will be able to purchase another motorcycle to have a bigger income. With this income, she wants to send all her children to college so that she will have the capacity to offer them a more worthwhile kind of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":364840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

K. is a 54-year-old man living in the town of Eva 3. He is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Lotu owns and operates a business making and selling food.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community. Lotu has been engaged in this business for more than six years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lotu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lotu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Lotu is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST, which will also be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lotu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":364853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

O.'s main source of income comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community (0). She is a 58-year-old woman living in the town of Puipaa. She is married and has eight adult children. Opeta has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Opeta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Opeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fish to sell. \r\n\r\nOpeta is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. This will be her sixth loan from SPBD. Opeta plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

F.'s main source of income comes from making and selling baked goods in her community (0). She is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Sesee K. She is married and has four school-age children. Lino has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 400 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lino joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Lino has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. \r\n\r\nLino is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her second loan from SPBD. Lino plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":364859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

P. is a 44-year-old woman living in the town of Toamua A.  She is married with four adult children. To make a living, Filifili makes and sells food. While not the only means for generating revenue, her main source of income comes from selling baked goods to the local community.  Filifili has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 1000 WST a month.\r\n\r\nFilifili joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Filifili has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  Filifili is now requesting a new loan of 1700 WST which will be used for the same reason.  The loan will be her fifth from SPBD.  Filifili plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

V. is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Salamumu Tai.  She is married with one school-aged child.  To make a living, Aleta raises crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Aleta has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n\r\nAleta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Aleta has successfully repaid a previous loan, to purchase general farm supplies and equipment, of 750 WST from SPBD.  Aleta is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used for the same purpose.  The loan will be her fifth loan from SPBD.  Aleta plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

E. is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Safaatoa Uta.  She is married and has six adult children.  To make a living, Karoline owns & operates a sewing business, selling a variety of clothes in the local community.  Karoline has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 1000 WST a month from these activities.\n\nKaroline joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Karoline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2750ST WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase a new sewing machine.  Karoline is now requesting a new loan of 3250ST WST, which will be used to purchase additional cotton materials and fabrics to make clothes.  The loan will be the sixth loan taken out by her from SPBD.  Karoline plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

P. is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Saleaumua.  She is married and has five school-aged children.  To make a living, Tinei owns & operates a business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Tinei has been engaged in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tinei joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tinei has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Tinei is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tinei plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F. is a 30-year-old mother of two children ages nine and three years old. Her loving partner and the father of her children, Jerry Gallano, is a fishpond caretaker and sometimes a carpenter. In 2006, Joan joined ASHI in order to have access to credit, which enabled her to put up her own business and own source of income to augment her husband's. \r\n\r\nWhen Joan started with her fish buy and sell business, she only sold a small volume of fish since her business capital was small. After several loans from ASHI and after showing her good performance in attendance during weekly center meeting, repayment, and business, she was allowed to have a larger loan. Eventually her business grew. The volume of fish she bought and sold increased. She also saved with ASHI every week. \r\n\r\nWith Joan's new loan, she plans to add crab, shrimp, and prawn to the variety of fish she sells. Jerry has been very happy for Joan's business since they can work together and have the opportunity to run their own business. Joan and Jerry can't wait for their business and their savings to grow because they want to have a fishpond of their own. Joan is praying that her business will be successful and that she and Jerry will be able to sustain their family's financial needs.\r\n\r\n

Josephine has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josephine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Sto.

Florencia is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Florencia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florencia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase a secondhand pedicab. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Florencia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":363720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase a second hand pedicab","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

Both are high school students and are sincere about studying. Salvador, Lorna's husband is a delivery helper for gas tanks, while Lorna is an entrepreneur. She is as hard working as her husband because she is determined to give her two children the opportunity of going to college - an opportunity which she and her husband never had when they were young because of poverty.\r\n\r\nLorna had different kinds of businesses when she had an access to credit for business capital through ASHI in 1997. However, none of those became successful until 2004. Lorna never thought of fish to buy and sell as a business, although the village where she and her family lives is surrounded by the sea and fish ponds. It was after several failures that she tried the said business. In 2004, Lorna's loan from ASHI was Php20,000. She used the loan to finance her first endeavor with fish to buy and sell. After years of doing such business activity, she found success and contentment. She has been a vendor of fish since then until now. With her previous loan she planned to buy crab, shrimp and other varieties of fish for her avid costumers to have many choices in buying. Lorna rents a space in the market where she sells her fish. \r\n\r\nDespite her busy schedule in attending to her business, Lorna gives time to attend to her weekly center meeting in ASHI and pays her weekly amortization from the loan she has taken out. Through ASHI, Lorna was able to realize the importance of savings thus making her save weekly in preparation for her other personal needs.

The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting corn and cassava for sale.

Godofredo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. Godofredo is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Godofredo from GDMPC.

S. is 37 years old and is married to Mr. Jun S.. She has five children and lives in Brgy. Canroma, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She is a dedicated wife who is determined to help her husband improve their life situation.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. has been engaged in food production for the past fifteen years. She and her husband, with the help of their older children, sell snack food, corn, vinegar and other food products to the neighboring towns, especially where there is a fiesta going on (and there is always a fiesta going on somewhere in the island of Negros).\r\n\r\nThis is not easy work because they need to wake up early to travel and set up their station, stay up late selling their product, and when the crowds are gone, pack up and go home. However, it earns a good income of about PHP 9,800 per month, so they persevere because it sustains the education of some of their children, and the needs of the family. Hard work, patience and discipline are the key elements to Mrs. S.'s continuing success.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 and the unsecured loans she has borrowed over the last ten years have enabled her to make her business a sustainable endeavor which is a great help to their family.\r\n\r\nAt present, Mrs. S. needs to purchase a transport vehicle to facilitate the delivery of her products and transport them from town to town as they transfer selling locations. This is why, for her 17th loan, Mrs. S. is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that, with her own transportation, she will be able to reach farther and stay longer in the towns and not be dependent on the availability of public transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":365011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The group is composed of 26 micro-entrepreneurs, including a member named N\u2019sila B..  This city of Kisangani, located north of the equator, is in Orientale province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it\u2019s on the border with Sudan and Uganda to the northeast.  The city was the victim of wars between two foreign armies in 2000.  \r\n\r\nN\u2019sila sells palm oil, rice, and corn at the I.A.T market in the city of Kisangani.  Since 2000, he has gained a fair amount of small business experience.  Selling fuel was his first business with $20 in initial capital.  Over the years, he changed businesses and has managed to establish a loyal customer base for advancing his business.  \r\n\r\nHis ambitions are, first of all, to take business trips in the future with the aim of supplying the people of the city with sought-after goods.  Secondly, it\u2019s to build a house for his family.  He obtained five loans from the micro-finance institution HOPE RDC, and he repaid them appropriately.  Right now, his business generates a profit of $40 a week.  Given the ever-increasing demand, the loan he\u2019ll receive next will allow him to bolster his inventory of merchandise by purchasing food items of the same type. \r\n\r\nN\u2019sila is 36 years old, married, and the father of two girls and two boys, ages 8 to 16.

Lidia is a widow who lives at the bank of the Popocatepetl volcano. She has a small chick farm, and because the village's climate is cool she occasionally loses a few of them since not all the chicks are able to survive.

Cristina T. admits that it is very hard to raise 11 children, especially when the family income cannot support the needs of the family. But determination, and being armed with her knowledge of handling a business, has helped her to survive the difficulties.\n\nMrs. Cristina T. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 and used her first loan of Php 3,000 to open a \"sari-sari\" or general store. She slowly expanded her business with each loan until she was able to add new lines to her business like selling Ready-to-Wear (RTW) clothes. Her general or \"sari-sari\" store now earns her a monthly income of Php 6,000. The income she earned in her business has enabled her to make a down-payment on a motorcycle for her husband which will also be used in her business.\n\nAt present Mrs. T. is on her 10th loan and is borrowing Php 17,000 which she intends to invest in expanding her business.\n\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams.

is a vegetable trader in an open-air market in Thika.

He buys the produce directly from farmers in the rural areas of Matuu, a rich agricultural area, transports them and then sells them to residents and small-scale retailers in Thika, Nairobi and the coastal region. He has been doing this for the last four years but the declining rainfalls are threatening crop production. Paul has requested a loan of KES 50,000 in order to increase his stock of potatoes, cabbages and carrots in readiness for the holy month of Ramadhan, as demand for these products is quite high then.

Her husband is a policeman.  \r\n<p>\r\nNorita has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about three years and belongs to the communal bank \"Los Manguitos\" (The Little Mangoes).  She used her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) to purchase shoes for sale.  Norita plans to use this loan of 3000 soles for several purposes.  She will have maintenance work done on her car, invest in a fish pond that she owns and purchase more shoes for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nNorita has many plans for the future and additional ideas for business ventures.  She wants to have a spare parts shop for cars, build a home for her family, rent out some of the rooms in this home, and also construct an event hall which can be rented out.  Norita is pleased to be working with Manuela Ramos, in part because it is an organization specifically dedicated to making credit available to women entrepreneurs.

Lizbeth sells clothes, costume jewelry and other merchandise.  She works independently with the loans she receives from the Kiva partner, Manuela Ramos.  Lizbeth is thirty-three years old and is married with two young children.  Her husband is a high school teacher.  The family lives in the city of Pucallpa.  \r\n\r\nLizbeth has been working with Manuela Ramos for about ten years and belongs to the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  With her first loan of 300 soles (about $100), she purchased regional farm products such as plantain and chickens to later resell in the city.  Lizbeth will use this loan of 1600 soles to purchase clothing and costume jewelery to sell.  All of her merchandise is ordered in advance by her customers.\r\n\r\nLizbeth's goal is to construct a second story for her house.  Once this construction is finished, Lizbeth plans to convert the first floor into a store where she can display her merchandise and hopefully increase her sales.

Before she started this business, Charity sold clothes in a market on the outskirts of Nairobi. Due to declining demand for clothes, she decided to open a cyber caf\u00e9 in April of this year. The cyber-business has been good, and she has requested a loan of Ksh. 20,000 to redo the cabling and wiring in order to improve the ambiance of her business. With increased traffic, she hopes to relocate her business from the third floor to the more accessible ground

Irma is twenty-five years old and is a single mother.  She works hard for the sake of her young daughter.  \r\n\r\nIrma has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about five years and is a member of the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  Irma invested her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in the business of selling beauty products.  This business partially financed her university studies. She plans to use this loan of 2500 soles to purchase undergarments and basic grocery products to sell in Masisea, where she works. Irma spends most of her time in Masisea but returns to Pucallpa at the end of every month to collect her teacher's salary.  \r\n\r\nIrma's goal is to design undergarments and to have her own boutique from which to sell them.  She is pleased to be working with Manuela Ramos because the organization gives loans without much bureaucracy and paperwork, unlike most other banks.

It is located in the Valle parish, which is 30 minutes outside the city of Cuenca.  Its members work in sales and agriculture.  Most of them are farmers.  Part of the population has emigrated due to lack of employment and the desire to give their families a better future.  For example, we mention a few of the members who are involved in different activities.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives in the Para\u00edso Bajo commity of the Valle.  She is single.  She has four children ages 24, 22, 19, and 4.  The first three children do not live with her; they have their own families.  By herself she has been able to get ahead with her home by working at different activities.  She lives in a rented house in the sector.  She works as a domestic employee in the city from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.  At home in the afternoon, she works at cultivating her land and raising animals (pigs, chickens, guinea pigs).  In the development of her work she has had no problems with her bosses or her neighbors.  She gets along well with everyone, and she is a woman who is very blessed.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member for five years.  She is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR because they have given her a lot of help with the loans they offer.  She says the group is very united and they all get along very well.  Each time they try to integrate more women to benefit from the loans.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been a member of the Fundaci\u00f3n for many years.  The loan she is now asking for is to buy more pigs, guinea pigs, and food (small shrubs and grass) for taking care of the animals.  Her goal is to keep working to be able to have her own house.\r\n\r\nZoila lives in the Jaime Rold\u00f3s residential area, which is located in the city of Cuenca.  She is 22, single, and she lives with her parents.  They live in their own home.  She studied in a beauty academy until the second year.  She plans to complete those studies.\r\n\r\nShe works in the 27 de Febrero market selling fruits and vegetables.  The business is her own, and she has been working for 13 years.  Her work schedule is from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. every day.  Her sister works with her.\r\n\r\nShe became part of the Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR because she saw the benefits of the loans given and the ease of getting and repaying them.  Her cousin, Maria Z., who is also a member, invited her.  This is her first loan, and she expects to continue as a member for a long time because her group is very united and supportive.\r\n\r\nZoila will use the loan to expand her business by buying more fruit, vegetables, and products that she needs.

El dinero que solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes y funguicidas, con los que abonar\u00e1 y fumigar\u00e1 sus cultivos de papas.    ","en":"Juan, 53, is a very noble and hardworking man.  He has lived with his life partner, Luc\u00eda, for many years.  They do not have children.  They currently live in the house on their farm, while they rent out their house in town.  In his youth he devoted himself to handicrafts.  He wove beautiful blankets and wool ponchos.  But, since he started married life he has leaned entirely towards planting and cultivating potatoes and peas.\r\n\r\nJuan is very happy with his crops.  They have turned out to be very profitable compared to his handicrafts.  When he has to cultivate, he goes to his fields very early in the morning accompanied by his wife.  To this couple, there is nothing more pleasant than working and cultivating their land.  Unfortunately, sometimes during the months from June to August the cold climate has hurt his potato crops.  He is, therefore, alternating his planting with peas in order to not lose his monetary investment.\r\n\r\nThis is his fifth loan with MFP.  In past loan cycles he has made every one of his payments punctually.  He wants to keep working with his Community Bank and with the rest of the members. He has come to have a lot of confidence and affection for the other members.\r\n\r\nThe money he is asking for is to buy fertilizers and fungicides.  He will use them to fertilize and fumigate his potato crops.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":365170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizers and fungicides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-07T18:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1548.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842637,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-07T20:44:03Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":127511,"name":"Severino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Severino tiene 60 a\u00f1os, es casado y padre de 4 hijos, de los cuales 3 de ellos viven fuera y el de 14 a\u00f1os vive con \u00e9l en la casa de su cu\u00f1ada.

He is a noble man who lives with the mother of his eight children, of which the two eldest work occasionally in the an area far from their home. The blood of a farmer runs through his veins since, from his infancy, he has not known a job other than working and taking care of his fields. With much dedication and enthusiasm, he takes care of his citrus plants (mandarin oranges and star fruits) and also, but in fewer quantity, he plants cocoa. Every season Pedro completes the cutting and cleaning of his star fruit crops since this fruit is profitable all year. Meanwhile, the oranges generate greater earnings during the months of January to March since it is the summer season in the capital.

is raising hogs in their backyard. She is a resident of Barangay Villa Marzo in Cordon, Isabela. She is happily married to Eufemio, who is a simple farmer.  They are blessed with six children.  Five of them are already married and only Vergel, who is 27 years old now, is still single.  He just finished a vocational course. Leonila is thankful because she is able to provide the needs of her family through the income she generates in her hog raising business and also through the earnings of her husband from farming. \r\n\r\nShe now hopes to avail herself of financial support from Kiva lenders. She wanted to borrow a loan amounting to PHP 19,000 for the maintenance of her hog raising business. She will utilize the loan to buy a supply of feed and also to buy additional piglets if there is still enough money left.  Leonila is grateful to have the chance to raise pigs because, according to her, it was really a big help in sustaining their family's needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":364884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional

Both of her children are currently students, with Roman studying in college, and Krisha studying in elementary school.  Marites hopes that, someday, her two children will earn a degree and become successful in their chosen careers. <p>\r\n\r\nHer business is more successful and helpful from an economic standpoint for their family than her husband's part-time carpentry business.  Fortunately, the income from her business has been able to support her family's living expenses, especially her children's school tuition.  Even so, she really wants her food-selling business to continue to grow.  Indeed, she sells a variety of foods, such as embutido, longganisa, and hot dogs.  Her desire to improve and expand her business motivated her to request a loan from Kiva lenders in the amount of 19,000 PHP ($400) in order to purchase more ingredients from retailers at reasonable prices.

She sells different kind of vegetables in their village.  More specifically, she buys vegetables at wholesale prices at the Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal (NVAT), where many vegetables are sold to retail customers.

She happily lives with her husband and a niece of who they have supported in her studies up to this time. \r\n\r\nEmelita is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000 from Kiva as additional business capital for her general store. She wants the loan to make her store more progressive. She is happy that, despite of the hardships of life, she is able to help her niece financially since she has no child yet. The loan is really helpful in sustaining her general store. Selling has been her passion since her childhood. She also just started a food production business and she hopes that it will be able to help to improve their standard of living and let them continue supporting her niece's educational needs.\r\n\r\n\u201cA family that prays together stays together\u201d said Emelita. She believes strongly in this quotation and she prays unceasingly for the goodness of her family and progress of her business to sustain their needs. Being an entrepreneur who is wishing the best for her business, Emelita works very hard and sacrifices much. She patiently manages to open her store at a very early hour in the morning and closes it late at night in order to earn more income. She loves her customers because they help her in her business and she gives them the best of her service. She prays to God that someday, from her sacrifices in the business, she will become successful in all her goals in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":364894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

C. is from the village of Mialen, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 23 years old. Leonora is single. To make a living, Leonora buys and sells bananas in the local community. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leonora joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Leonora from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

more the merrier,\u201d is Josephine's comment about having a big family. She has nine children, three of whom are still in school. Josephine is happily married to Romeo, age 57, who works as a farmer. Her family resides in the rural flat area of Cabisera 27 Ilagan, Isabela. \r\n\r\nJosephine manages a hog-raising business in the back of their house. The business helps them, especially in times of emergency. That is why she wants to maintain it and make it more productive someday. \r\n\r\nHaving a big family is not easy.  She and her husband are doing their best to cope with necessities, so she decided to venture into another business: selling vegetables. She believes that having another business is more beneficial to her family than to depend only on hog-raising, where they have to wait 3-4 months for their income.  \r\n\r\nJosephine still aims to be even more progressive, and for this reason, she is requesting a second loan of PHP 8,000 from Kiva lenders to expand her vegetable and hog-raising businesses. She hopes that, with the loans, she can support her family, especially the educationof her three children who are in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

C. is from the village of Capucao in Ozamiz City. She is 33 years old. Tessie is married and has 3 young children. To make a living, Tessie plants, harvests, and sells corn. Tessie has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tessie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tessie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Tessie is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to pay for services to increase crop yield. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Tessie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and for daily consumption. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She collects and buys scrap materials like old newspapers, used\/empty bottles, boxes, plastic, etc., and generates income by selling them in junk shops. She is happy that her chosen business provides her family with a daily income at low capital investment and implements solid waste management in their town and nearby villages. \r\n\r\nTo further sustain the business, Josie is asking for the support of Kiva lenders to keep her business growing and help her community and the environment. She hopes to borrow PHP 10,000 for additional business capital.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":364902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"Additional

Her husband is a rice mill operator. Three of their children are still studying, while their eldest is already a college graduate. Marilyn hopes and prays that God will give them more strength as they are now growing older.

Phorn P. is 28-year-old and a resident of Pursat Province.

Rita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 14th loan taken out by Rita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Lorraine. She is a wife to Loue and an entrepreneur to many of her customers. Maribeth enjoys every single day of her life playing different roles being a woman. At the age of 27, she became a member of ASHI. She made a loan, and she found herself running a business she enjoyed the most, buying and selling fish. Five years ago, Maribeth was still in the process of discovering the secret towards business success. As she goes along with her discovery, loans she made in ASHI have helped her. Eventually she found what she was looking for - happiness being the owner and manager of her own business. She has grown and produced another kind of business out of her profit- a variety store. \r\n\r\nFrom a PHP5,000 loan she made when she first joined ASHI, now she makes a PHP24,000 loan to be used to finance her fish business and her variety store. She plans to add shrimp, prawn, and crab to the items she sells. \r\n\r\nSomeday, Maribeth wants all of her children to finish college and have their own career. She would be very happy to see them enjoying a life that is not under the umbrella of poverty.
