With money received from the loan he wants to purchase auto parts to repair his car.\r\n\r\nFarida T., 33, is married with a daughter and a son, both of whom attend school. Five years ago, with an initial investment of 8,000 soms, she bought three sheep and then resold them after fattening. In five years, Farida has increased the number of her livestock to fifteen. She applied for the loan because she wants to improve her living conditions and purchase furniture. In the future she plans to open a kiosk near the house and start selling convenience goods.\r\n\r\nKumushai J. is the treasurer of the group. She is 51 and married with three sons and two daughters. All the children are married and live separately with their families. Ten years ago, with an initial investment of 5,000 soms, Kumushai opened a kiosk and began to sell convenience goods. But then her husband suggested she start selling meat, because nobody in their village does that. When Kumushai started to sell meat, she noticed that the demand for meat is high enough and she makes good money. She applied for the loan because she needs to purchase sheep.

Over the years, her work has developed and she has built a good business reputation.

Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF InternationA., Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the CentrA.

C. is 22 years of age and a resident of Phnom Penh, where she has established a small family home with other members. She is a good housewife who either takes care of a young child or arranges a daily routine. C. always relies on the income from her husband who works as a machinery repairman.

Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Kiva borrower is a 47-year-old widow woman living with her three children. After the death of her husband, she found herself alone and responsible for the three children. So she decided to operate this mini market in 2006 when she was widowed. The store was opened 10 years ago by her husband. And she was able to manage her grocery shop and make a profit for her family. She offers all types of food products, dairy products, breads, detergents etc. With the loan of US $1200 that she requested, she will be able to increase her store\u2019s inventory. In the future, she expects her business will continue to grow in the coming year.\n \nIt is very common in Lebanon to find small supermarkets selling perishable and non-perishable goods. As members of the communities themselves, storeowners have a deep understanding of local consumer needs and can offer products that meet local demands. The strong network of community relationships are an important component of life in Lebanon, especially in smaller towns and villages.\n\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\n\nAbout Ameen:\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\n\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\n\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

From the threshold, constant challenges can ominously look one in the face and if one does not have that strength of character, everything may go up in smoke. One lady with a wealth of good will who has withstood enormous operating cost challenges in her retail shop business in Buziika- Lugazi over the course of the last 12 years is 34-year-old N. Fatuma, a happily married mother of five. Her reputation, she says, was once at stake, given the bad rapport she had with relatives who often wanted free goods from her shop, against her will.

He is married and has one little daughter. Eldiyar was born into a large family where all the children helped their parents in farming. He was the oldest one so he had to do all of the hard work around the house. He pastured cattle, plowed the land and gathered in the harvest. \n\nAt that time, Eldiyar\u2019s family had one cow and one bull-calf. Later on, they got more cattle. In 2008, Eldiyar got married. His parents gave him one horse and one milk cow, which became the first investment in Eldiyar\u2019s own business. \n\nDuring the last two years, his efforts have been aimed at supporting and expanding his household. He managed to multiply the number of cattle and today he has five milk cows and fifteen sheep. Also, he cultivated vegetables on a plot of land and worked hard to get a good harvest of high quality products. \n\nEldiyar applied for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy five bull-calves. With the revenues from this investment, he plans to broaden his business by purchasing more cattle for fattening. Speaking of his plans for future, Eldiyar dreams of establishing a large farm and building his own house. \n\nBai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading micro-finance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan.

S. is a widow who lives in Barangay Tiniguiban, Puerto Princesa, Palawan. She earns her living by operating four business ventures: a restaurant, a general store, a farm and a room-for-rent business. \r\n\r\nInocencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Inocencia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 35,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of $675, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing 40,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase ingredients for the food she sells in her restaurant and to start a new business selling soft drinks wholesale. \r\n\r\nShe works hard and wants to expand her business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Inocencia S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a small producer in the city of Istaravshan in Tajikistan. Together with his children they\u2019ve been raising cattle for more than five years. These produce the income which allows him to feed his family. As well as caring for his livestock, he also cultivates an agricultural crop, wheat, which helps with the family's diet and provides additional income. \r\n\r\nNemat has asked for this loan to buy young cattle in order to obtain a better profit. His greatest wish is to be able to improve his farm by constructing enclosures and establishing better grazing for his livestock.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

construction supplies at the market has become the only source of income for Kuvvanjbek, a 23-year-old man who's been doing this for three years. This young man has many projects for his future, and to build his own house and family is one of them. He's good at what he does, and this is why he's been able to support himself and his whole family through his business. \r\n\r\nHis wish is to add more goods and in that way increase the range of materials and supplies to offer to his clients. Kuvvanjbek would pay back this loan and with the money earned he would be able to pay for his technical career education.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 36 years old and he makes a living buying and selling livestock. He's married with three children who he must feed and educate. Over the years, he has become very knowledgeable about what is required to raise cattle, their feeding, their calving, etc.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that, in the past, this man endured hard economic times for a while, but he's managed to come through thanks to the help provided by IMON International. IMON International has granted him loans that he has used to buy calves, which is the reason that he needs this loan now. The loan will greatly improve Khairullo\u2019s income and his family's living standard.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

V., his work as a teacher never ends.  Even though he's retired from teaching, he continues practicing his vocation, but now he advises his students on everything relating to nutrition.  At 61 years old, Professor Policarpo works marketing nutritional products to improve the body's defenses while energizing and balancing it.  He also sells a variety of additional products, like clothes, shoes, and small electrical appliances.\r\n\r\nHe began his business in 2005 when he was a teacher in the Departamento de Bol\u00edvar, but after retiring, he began working more persistently.  He is always available to work every day so he can make more money.  His customer base consists of friends from his teaching days, relatives, recommended customers, and employees with good payment habits.  \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is his first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  With the loan, he will buy nutritional products wholesale in cash, as well as seasonal merchandise of clothes, shoes, and small electrical appliance in order to make the most of his customer's high demand during the second half of the year.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to continue increasing his sales so he can improve his quality of life.  Policarpo really enjoys his shop's location, since it is in the epicenter of shopping in southern Barranquilla near the Atl\u00e9tico Junior's football stadium, Estadio Metropolitano.<br

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband and children in the Koulikoro neighborhood of the city of Koutiala (Sikasso Region).   \r\n\r\nFor sociocultural reasons Aoua never went to school, which is why she is now practicing the business she learned at her mother's knee.  After unsuccessfully  trying a number of different activities, she settled into buying and selling assorted goods (fabrics, shoes, etc.) 11 years ago.  She is greatly sought after, and her clients appreciate her because of the quality of her goods.  In order to grow her business and satisfy her clients, Aoua decided to join the microfinance partner Soro Yiriwaso 3 years ago.  She has been a part of 4 group loans and is now requesting her second individual loan; all her previous loans were repaid on time. \r\n\r\nShe plans to buy 20 wax print wraps with this loan.  She buys her goods at the Koutiala market and sells them in town for cash or credit, to a clientele of both women and men.  She expects to earn 90,000 francs per month income which she will use to make loan repayments, contribute to the daily expenses of the family, and re-invest into her business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eileen Jessop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":582970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy wax print wraps","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aoua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":89099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180842,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":89099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613522,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":89099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606206,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":89099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360811,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-02T15:12:25Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222236,"name":"In God We Trust.

She is there on Saturdays and Sundays from 9 am to 5pm but on weekends she has hired help to run the stand. Rosa and her husband also go to the various fairs in Cusco.

She didn\u2019t have a formal education and it was her husband who taught her how to sew and manufacture clothing.  It was a bit of a challenge at first, because she also had to care for her one year old son.\r\n\r\nShe has always wanted to work on her own and it was a friend who encouraged her to lease a workshop in a central location.  This allowed her to earn additional income and improve her quality of life.  Her husband bought her first sewing machine (basic), which she still keeps as a memento.\r\n\r\nNelly began making dresses and skirts.  Her neighbors knew that she was a seamstress and it was they who recommended her services to their friends.  She began to increase her income little by little, completed her studies, and over time began buying more fabrics and thread with the loans she received.\r\n\r\nShe had the opportunity to become well known in the various schools, where she maD. uniforms for teachers, but it became necessary for her to acquire a chain stitch sewing machine.  For this reason she approached Edaprospo-Prosperidad to request a loan in order to buy the machine.  Things went well for her and she began making wedding gowns and formals.  This generated additional income for her.\r\n\r\nShe did a good job managing her business and was able to buy more machines and the income provided her the means with which to pay for her three children\u2019s education.  They have all achieved professional careers.  She was also able to buy her own workshop in a central location and no longer offers her services to private institutions because her business is doing very well.  The income she now earns is for herself and for her husband, and to treat her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nNelly will use the money from this loan to buy fabric because she has orders for dresses for the Peruvian Independence Day.  It makes her feel good to have achieved most of her goals and to continue to be able to support her family by running the business she enjoys; dressmaking.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":583059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chosica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.943056 -76.709444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3300,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831598,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098157,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390826,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529106,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T19:45:48Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222295,"name":"Rodrigo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodrigo is a 70-year-old father who lives with his wife and son,  in Montes de Oca, located in the Central Valley of Costa Rica.

Of his five children only one is dependent on him, a son who is in high school. Constancio makes a living growing potatoes on his 3 hectares of land in Kuri Mayu, a rural community 62 kilometers away from the city, so it is very difficult to be approved for a loan from a bank. Kiva partner Cidre took the initiative of going to this rural area. Constancio tells us that his wife died in a traffic accident while she was returning from the Colomi flea market after selling her products there. What Constancio wants is for his youngest son to finish his studies and become a professional like an agronomy technician so he can work and earn a good income so he can provide and care for him when he becomes an old man so he doesn't suffer.

Mar\u00eda del Carmen es toda una experta en negocios, porque siempre, desde el a\u00f1o 1986, ha tenido uno: el primero fue un restaurante con su esposo, cuando \u00e9ste se pension\u00f3; luego una peluquer\u00eda en su propia casa, al que adicion\u00f3 la venta de prendas de oro y en el 1991 viajaba y tra\u00eda mercanc\u00eda para la venta desde Maicao, municipio fronterizo con Venezuela, pero cuando esta forma de negociar no fue rentable y empez\u00f3 a encontrar en Barranquilla mercanc\u00eda a buen precio, se dedic\u00f3 exclusivamente a la venta de esta mercanc\u00eda variada , mediante el sistema de cr\u00e9dito. Mar\u00eda ha recibido 6 cr\u00e9ditos con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo que ha amortizado efectivamente, su credikiva es su s\u00e9ptimo cr\u00e9dito, con \u00e9l comprar\u00e1 una lavadora, ropa, calzado y una balanza para negocio, todo esto ya encargado. Los financiamientos otorgados a Mar\u00eda del Carmen han sido muy valiosos, porque con ellos ha logrado utilidades, convertidas hoy en aportes para su hogar, especialmente en lo que tiene que ver con la alimentaci\u00f3n, el vestuario de sus hijos, apoyo a sus nietos y el poder contar siempre un capital efectivo para compras de oportunidad e inversi\u00f3n para su negocio. Aun sigue con el sue\u00f1o de tener un restaurante bien organizado, porque le apasiona el \u00e1rea de preparaci\u00f3n de alimentos.

Mar\u00eda F. es una mujer muy activa participa en la Junta de acci\u00f3n comunal del barrio donde vive, donde hace mucha gesti\u00f3n comunitaria, por eso la conocen en Soledad y adem\u00e1s siempre est\u00e1 a la expectativa de captar nuevos clientes reales que le signifiquen ingresos. ","en":"Mar\u00eda F. G. makes a living selling all types of merchandise, especially household appliances, clothing, and shoes.  She lives in the city of Soledad, which is 15 minutes away from Barranquilla, with her husband and four children who range in age from 18 to 39.  Mar\u00eda del Carmen is an expert at her business because she has always worked in her own venture since 1986.  The first business she had was a restaurant she managed with her husband when he became a pensioner.  Later she started a beauty salon in her home and eventually began selling gold jewelry in 1991.  Mar\u00eda also traveled and brought back merchandise to sell from Maicao, a town that lies near the border with Venezuela.  Whenever her traveling retail business became less profitable, she began purchasing merchandise in Barranquilla at a better price.  Now she devotes herself exclusively to selling different types of merchandise on credit.  \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda has received six previous loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has paid them off effectively.  This Kiva loan will be her seventh one and she will use it to purchase a washing machine, clothing, shoes, and a scale for her business since she has already received orders for these items.  The loans that were provided to Mar\u00eda del Carmen have been valuable because they helped her generate income to buy products for her home, especially food and clothing for her children.  She also supports her grandchildren, so she would like to have sufficient capital so that she can take advantage of buying opportunities and investments in her business.  She continues to dream of having a well-organized restaurant once again because she is passionate about preparing food.  Her greatest challenge with her retail business is competition because there have been many instances in which other merchants sell goods that are much cheaper.  However, it is her job to explain to her customers the relationship between price and specific elements of quality such as durability.  \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is an active board member of the community action committee in her neighborhood, which does a lot of work related to community development.  She is well-known in Soledad and is always looking for new customers to help generate more income.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

It's comical to hear her say that as a child she didn't like these little critters but how they now help support the household.\r\n\r\nIt was on a cousin's birthday when she received 4 female guinea pigs so she could begin raising them; she had to purchase a male to begin reproduction.  The animals are fed alfalfa, fishmeal, and bran.  She invested her first loan in deworming medication which she applies twice a year.\r\n\r\nThe females turned out pregnant and the offspring are later sold after a few months, she even sometimes uses them to feed herself.  She currently has 18 guinea pigs, 2 of which are pregnant.  The sales are helping her get her children through school, one is at the university specializing in physics-math and her other two children are still in school.  \r\nThe loans is for the purchase of balanced feed, and a male guinea pig.  Laura also cooks at a parish in Huarochiri as another form of income for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Gustavo  Gutierrez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":583163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase balanced feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-18T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":70.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098158,"comment":null},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":70.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390827,"comment":null},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":70.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529107,"comment":null},{"amount":24.75,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":69.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665216,"comment":null},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":70.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408506,"comment":null},{"amount":24.77,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":69.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826831,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T05:15:10Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222370,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase agricultural materials to plant potatoes.

Alejandro is a construction worker who builds housing in the same area. He is a humble but hard-working person and needs the money to purchase a plot of land in order to build his own house.

Being without work led him to rent a storefront in the city center and start a massage therapy business. The business is going very well now that the city is returning to normal. He is requesting a loan to pay for the rental of his store\u00b4s premises.\r\n\r\nHe values and appreciates the loan, since it will enable him to grow and to have a better standard of living. He is also committed to meeting his payment obligations on time.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva

It is an agricultural district, which is comprised of various rural areas that are quite separate from each other.  This district belongs to the Lambayeque province, which is over two hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has been selling medicine in a pharmacy for two years.  He has a place, which is located close to the center of the town.  This business is very well received because his main customers are the people who live in the diverse populated centers in the area.

S. is a young mother who aims to become successful someday by increasing her fishing business while her husband closely works with her as a fisherman. They work together for the future of their family. Lorie is thankful to ASHI, for through the loans they have provided since 1998, she has been able to support her fishing operation by purchasing a motor boat, fishing net, and other tools of her business. She is hoping to raise more fish to sell in the future through hard work and the continuous assistance of ASHI and Kiva. \r\n\r\nBecause a lack of business capital encouraged her to look for financial support from KIVA lenders, Lorie will be glad when her loan request is granted; she will utilize the loan wisely by purchasing an additional fishing boat and fishing net. Lorie\u2019s hard work and patience are her foundation in bettering her family's life.  \r\n\r\nThe income she gets from the business is very helpful in supporting the business itself and meeting the needs of her family, especially in providing school allowances for her three children. She hopes that someday she will be able to expand her fishing business further. She is glad for the secured opportunity of taking this loan and for your support and encouragement. Lorie hopes to maintain a long-term sustainable fishing business.

T. is a 62-year-old mother of five. She is married to a farmer who works a small parcel of their land. Her husband is also hired by other people in their village during the rice planting and harvest season. This livelihood of hers started more than 10 years ago, but improving the family's living conditions remains impossible. \r\n\r\nFely applied for this loan to finance fertilizers, insecticides, and other supplies. She wants to buy these items in advance in order to get a lower price, and to avoid borrowing money from her neighbor during planting season. When she borrows from her neighbor, she usually pays back in rice grains after harvest which is very disadvantageous to her. Fely hopes that through her loan, she and her husband can save their harvest and get a better price at market. Fely also engaged her second venture--raising livestock in their wide and verdant backyard for supplementary income.\r\n\r\nFely and her husband lack the education that is required to be employed. Therefore, they have used their own skills to earn money for their children and to survive. Fely has never wanted anything else in her life as a mother other than to give her children a better future by sending them to school through college. However, she failed with her four eldest children, because some of them married at an early age and others stopped going to school and worked instead. Fely's last hope is youngest child who is in the fourth year of high school and will soon be in college, and, also, her grandchildren. \r\n\r\nShe also wants to have an electricity connection for their farm\u2019s operation and to build a better house for the

Consuelo, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: farming and selling meat products.\r\n\r\nNenita\u2019s husband, Romeo, is a driver and they have nine children from 17 to 35 years old. One of their children is currently going to school and also helps in the business, while the other eight children are already working on their own livelihoods.\r\n\r\nNenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of their family's life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in farming and selling meat by delivery. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nNenita is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 was used to fund operations of her meat sales business. The loan had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 20th loan, the amount of PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizer for her farm. Nenita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture of Nenita was taken with her standing crop of sugarcane in the background.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Having  repaid her previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is now requesting a loan of 9,000 PHP for the same purpose. This will be Zosima fifth loan from ASKI, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her store.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":582222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She resides in a city called Multan, which is famous for its history, in Pakistan. \r\n\r\nShe has raised a son and a daughter and made them qualified in their own fields. Her son is involved in making and selling bed sheets. He got full training from one of the bed-sheets production factories and now he uses his skills for his own business. Her daughter has received training in embroidery skills from her. She and Amna now help each other in preparing embroidered dresses to complete orders of the customers. \r\n\r\nHer husband, 58 years of age, is a driver by trade. He drives a rickshaw (a three-wheeled motor vehicle) and works hard to put three meals on the table of his family. \r\n\r\nThey all are very hardworking people. They all make effort in improving their financial condition and the living standard of their family as well. \r\n\r\nAmna is in her third loan cycle with Asasah. In the previous two loans, she maintained good credit behavior and never missed a meeting. This time, she has applied for a loan for her embroidery business. With the loan amount, she will buy embroidery materials, such as cloth, beads and colored thread, in bulk and make improvements to her
