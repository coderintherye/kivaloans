She lives in her partner\u2019s parents\u2019 house with their 3 year-old daughter. Two years ago, Amanda started a business selling clothing and shoes with capital lent to her by her parents. During the Christmas season she also sells toys, which generates additional income for her household. Amanda makes her sales as a door-to-door sales person (she sells merchandise to people in their homes). She is friendly and agreeable toward her customers, so she has been gaining clients who make larger orders of clothing, shoes, and other accessories. The majority of her customers are from the same neighborhood where she lives. She is requesting a loan so she can buy the merchandise that she offers during the Christmas season. Amanda did not finish high school for a variety of reasons. Amanda\u2019s dream is to finish her studies, have her own house, and to have her own business that will generate greater income, which would allow her to have a better quality of life. \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":414734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase toys for the upcoming Christmas season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T03:50:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amanda Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":69.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":72.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":74.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":76.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":86.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":89.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.9},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":94.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.4,"local_amount":69.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":69.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769442,"comment":null},{"amount":25.48,"local_amount":72.81,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":72.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110658250,"comment":null},{"amount":25.94,"local_amount":74.12,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123889195,"comment":null},{"amount":26.75,"local_amount":76.42,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":76.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923012,"comment":null},{"amount":28.33,"local_amount":80.94,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-20T07:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137225612,"comment":null},{"amount":88.24,"local_amount":252.12,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-19T08:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":252.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145159779,"comment":null},{"amount":130.86,"local_amount":373.89,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":374.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177379429,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T17:52:14Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:19:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147802,"name":"Cerelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cerelina D. is from the village of Kuguita, Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

She is 33 years old and her husband, Emilio, 35, works for a construction firm. They have six children: the eldest is in high school, four are in grade school, and the youngest stays at home.\r\n\r\nArlene started cooking and selling food items and other goodies to her neighbors last year. She sells rice cakes, finger foods, snacks, burgers and fruit shakes and earns close to P10,000 a month. Her earnings answer for their daily basic needs.\r\n\r\nArlene is now in need of a loan of P8,000 to buy food ingredients. She is also set to buy a small grill for cooking burgers.

However, the death of her husband forced her to resume working.  She has now been selling cosmetics and clothing for 10 years.  Dora takes great joy in her work and provides her customers with quality service.\r\n<p>\r\nShe considers her line of work to be profitable because she can purchase her products at wholesale through catalogs and then sell them at retail prices.  Her future plans include opening a store out of her home where she sells cosmetics and beauty accessories.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Dora\u2019s first individual loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  She was previously a member of a Communal Bank, so she knows that she has to make her payments on time in order to be eligible for future loans and have the opportunity to grow as a businesswoman.  With the money she requested, Dora will purchase large quantities of beauty products to sell during the upcoming holiday festivities. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She has worked in her store for more than 27 years, and during that time her store has grown to become one of the busiest in her town.  Julia thinks that her store is profitable because of the amount of time that she has been in business and because of the quality of the products that she offers, in addition to the good customer service that she provides her customers when they are making their purchases.  Julia is always wishing to improve her business, since the demand is increasing and she needs to install new shelves so she can facilitate her customers\u2019 orders.\r\n\r\nThis is Julia\u2019s eighth loan with Kiva partner Microfinanzas PRISMA, and just like her colleagues at her communal bank, she works hard so that she can prosper in her business.

She is identified by these traits in the town where she has lived for the past 20 years with her husband and three children. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a very gifted cook.  Ever since she was very young, she has been known for her food's delicious flavors.  Her friends began to ask for her services for social events and celebrations.  Ever since then, she has run her business of cooking and selling food.  A few months ago, she was able to open a popular diner where many members of the community go to eat; she serves them with the help of a few of her neighbors.  Mar\u00eda considers her business to be profitable because the cost of food supplies is low and the demand of her product is high.  For these reasons, her future plans are to continue furnishing the diner with some additional tables and chairs for the comfort of her customers, whose number seems to grow every day. \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  She knows that the responsibility of her payments supports the work that she does and the commitment that she has with her community bank, where she has been a member for more than 5 years. With the money she is asking for now, she would be able to invest in the purchase of merchandise (foodstuffs) that she needs in order to continue preparing her tasty dishes.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Colleen  Godfrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":414875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"The purchase of foodstuffs for the preparation of her dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T06:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":105.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":116.91},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":121.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":129.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":139.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":144.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.4},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.98,"local_amount":105.65,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843103,"comment":null},{"amount":75.68,"local_amount":216.22,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":216.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734681,"comment":null},{"amount":3.94,"local_amount":11.26,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":11.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124070,"comment":null},{"amount":42.4,"local_amount":121.16,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":121.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959752,"comment":null},{"amount":45.25,"local_amount":129.28,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":129.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992608,"comment":null},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":132.81,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":132.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717388,"comment":null},{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":139.41,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":139.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751175,"comment":null},{"amount":50.47,"local_amount":144.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":144.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933731,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T11:46:06Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147856,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda M. is from the village of Sibugon Lopez, in Jaena Misamis Occidental.

V. is now 45 years old and is happily married to Gaudencio V. who is the same age. The sad part in the married life of Josephine and Gaudencio is that they lost their second child. That\u2019s one of the trials in their life that really tested their faith. So the three children became two: Marites, now 25 years old and working as a sales lady, and Joshua, now 16 years old, and currently studying.\r\n\r\nThe main source of their income is through their variety store business that Josephine has run for ten years now. When she joined Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), she always used the loans that she received in her variety store business to make it grow. And now with her 8th loan she will use the loan again for improving her business. She will buy necessary things for her business to make it more productive.\r\n\r\nAs a member of ASHI for four years now, Josephine has been a good member. She is always present at center meetings and always on time in paying her responsibilities. That is why Josephine is really sure that she can make their life a better one because of her effort and with the help of ASHI.\r\n\r\nOne of Josephine\u2019s dreams is that her youngest son finish his studies because she knows that education is one of the keys to success. She really loves her children, so she always wants the best for them every day of their life. She doesn\u2019t want to experience again losing a child; it really broke her heart so much.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":414906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

A. is from the village of San Antonio.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling wild-caught fish in the local community. Joinelyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joinelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joinelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Joinelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to repair her fishing boat. This will be the second loan taken out by Joinelyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 30 years old. Mercy is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Mercy runs a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products such as viand (tasty dishes) in the local community. Mercy has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mercy joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Mercy is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Mercy from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 31 years old, divorced, and lives happily with her two daughters \u2013 Francesca (age 14) and Yurubi (age 4).\r\n<p> \r\nEvery day Carmen wakes up early to care for her two young daughters, who provide her with a reason for living and are the objects of her adoration.  Afterwards, she must quickly prepare meals for her patrons who purchase the rich and diverse dishes she offers on a daily basis.  She fulfills any request without objection, because her customers also ask her to deliver meals to neighbors, acquaintances, or friends.  Her dishes are in high demand.  Carmen\u2019s ability to create a new dish every day was something she learned from her mother.  Even though she keeps her recipes a secret, she manages to satisfy her customers by providing flavorful dishes and selling them at a low price.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she offers a different dish every day of the week, her business has grown rapidly and continues to generate good earnings.  Her daughters help out in their spare time, but Carmen prefers that they focus on their studies so that they can pursue a profession, an opportunity that she did not have.  Her ex-husband provides financial support in raising her daughters.  Carmen hopes to manage her own restaurant in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though she is taking her ninth loan with MFP, Carmen once again promises to be punctual and make her payments on time.  She hopes to continue growing and succeeding.  She is happy to be working with her Communal Bank because the other women in her group are fighters just like her.  With the money she is requesting, she will buy merchandise to restock her pantry so that she can continue preparing meals to sell.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":414948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients for preparing meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T18:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.5,"local_amount":238.58,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":238.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843108,"comment":null},{"amount":170.06,"local_amount":485.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":486.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734686,"comment":null},{"amount":6.77,"local_amount":19.34,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124075,"comment":null},{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":276.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":277.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959757,"comment":null},{"amount":167.81,"local_amount":479.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":479.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717393,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T19:37:13Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147895,"name":"Zesenjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zesenjargal E. and his wife operate a consumer goods trading business out of a shipping container at a local market.

With the money she is currently requesting, she plans to purchase materials she needs to continue providing her services. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":414950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of products for work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T05:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.5,"local_amount":238.58,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":238.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843109,"comment":null},{"amount":170.06,"local_amount":485.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":486.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734687,"comment":null},{"amount":6.77,"local_amount":19.34,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":19.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124076,"comment":null},{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":276.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":277.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959758,"comment":null},{"amount":167.81,"local_amount":479.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":479.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717394,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T13:44:50Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147898,"name":"Naidan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naidan G. manages a wood crafts business with the help of her husband, Davaanyam.

She lives with her 20-year-old daughter Vanesa and her sister Margarita in a modest and well cared for house in the southern part of the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nEvery day, she styles her customers' hair. She is a hairdresser by profession and she has been doing this kind of work almost her whole life. She estimates that it was about 30 years ago that she started. Felipa really enjoys her work because not only does it generate a good income but it has allowed her to give her daughter a good start in life and she is very proud of having been able to do that. One day, it just occurred to her to  start up a salon on her own and that's how it has continued until now. She knows to rely on the only tools that will never fail her, her hands. Although her work is very tiring, Felipa would like to someday have a larger salon with better equipment and a more comfortable setting for her client base, which continues to grow daily since her hands are almost magic and she styles hair in a phenomenal way.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP and she is once again committed to be timely with her repayments. She plans to invest the money from the loan in the purchase of more modern equipment for her beauty salon and in improvements to the salon itself.

They live happily in their cozy house which is located in highly populated area in southern Lima.\r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years, she has sold groceries. She noted the need for this type of product in her area and that was how she got started with her own store since there was no competition and she could do it from the comfort of her own home. Florentina, who is usually known as Flor, likes her business because she has the luxury of being her own boss and can run things smoothly. Also, her business is very profitable since it is a good option in the area as it offers more than other corner stores such as fresh chicken. Her customers prefer to come to her store rather than walk to the market. For the future, as a good businesswoman, she would like to grow her business and perhaps contract someone to help her since sometimes she can't keep up with demand on her own.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP and she's sure that she will be very punctual with her repayments as she was with those for the first loan since she knows that timing is very important in business. She likes working with her village bank because it is very rewarding to work with such responsible people. With the money that she's requesting, she will buy supplies for her store to be able to offer her customers a wider variety of quality products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":414957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T14:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843111,"comment":null},{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1001,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734689,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959760,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992613,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717396,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T15:57:11Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147902,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Cecilia N., 37 years old.

Pero tambi\u00e9n piensa invertir en la compra de golosinas para la venta, pues el servicio de imprenta no es muy activo, y ella siempre piensa como negociante.\n","en":"Horencia is a very polite woman of 56 who lives with her 3 children: F\u00e1tima, age 19; Esteban, age 16; and Ricardo, age 14. She works hard every day to give the best of herself, not only to her family, but also to her customers. \r\n\r\nFor the past eight years, this amiable lady has operated a printing business in her home, offering printing services for various types of tickets, receipts, and all other related items at low prices. She operates the business with her children, who help her when they finish their schoolwork. Horencia is not stopping here, however; she wants to expand her business, offering better service and acquiring modern equipment for her print shop, since, as she says, \"it is more convenient to have something printed here than downtown, and the service is the same.\" She also knows that someday her business will be the best legacy she can leave her children. \r\n \r\nThe tranquil days of this serene woman are filled with printing orders, conversations with customers, and the smell of paper. She knows that her print shop will someday be bigger, and she can almost visualize it; she only needs to give the best of herself in order to achieve it. \r\n\r\nHorencia has already worked with MFP for some time; this is her ninth loan, which once again will be put to good use as an investment in improving her business. However, she is also thinking about investing in the purchase of some snacks to sell in her shop, since the printing business is not constantly active, and she is always thinking like an entrepreneur. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":414961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","use":"Investing in expanding her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T14:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Horencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843112,"comment":null},{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":334.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734690,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959761,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992614,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":165.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717397,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T16:56:25Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147904,"name":"Baba Jan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baba jan is the son of S.

R. is a struggling mother of five children. Through her hard work and determination to bring them out of poverty, she was able to send the eldest four to college where they took vocational courses. Her small business enabled her to augment the income of her husband who is a motorcycle driver. Now, two of her children work in Manila and two have their own families.\r\n\r\nFor her youngest child, Bernardita wants to ensure her future by supporting her studies until she graduates from college. She believes that the only way she could make this dream of hers come true is through strengthening her small business and making it grow to increase the profits she makes from it. She therefore is requesting a loan through ASHI to be able to support her dream for her family through her farming business managed by her

A. is from the village of Tagulalo, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur.

She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Arlene joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to improved and expand her business.\r\n\r\nArlene is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to pay for the tuition of her children. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

(83) is a 37-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.  Chung is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 041 (041 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng).\n\nChung is married and has one school-aged child.  To making a living, Chung is starting a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising cattle for sale.  Chung has been engaged in this business for over one year and earns approximately 1.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Chung joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Chung successfully repaid a previous loan of 2.761.200 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND, which will be used to purchase more baby livestock to raise and sell.  The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Chung plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\n\n1.  H.  Th\u1ecb Hoa (63) is a 29-year-old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\n\n2.  \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb D\u01b0\u01a1ng (77) is a 55-year-old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\n\n3.  L\u00ea Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ea3m  (78) is a 53-year-old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the food sector running a food stall.\n\n\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women\n\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nChung V\u0169 K.

Rosenda has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Rosenda joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Rosenda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her third from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

V. is from the village of Danao. She is 54 years old. Catalina is married and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Catalina runs a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Catalina has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Catalina joined PMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Catalina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Catalina is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to further expand the business. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Catalina from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Preciosa has been engaged in her business for more than ten years with an approximated average monthly earnings of 1,800 PHP.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Preciosa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Preciosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets, livestock feed and other supplies. Preciosa is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase more livestock feed and supplies. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Preciosa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Makhsuda is 45 years old. She is divorced and the mother of 3 children. For 20 years now, Makhsuda has been selling clothing. She sells socks for men and children in the central local market. Makhsuda spends the income from her business for educating of her children as she is dreaming that her children will have a higher education. <P>\r\n\r\nMakhsuda has been provided with the loans by IMON for 4 years already . For the entire period of time she has shown herself to be an accurate client. Today she is requesting 5000 Somoni ($1150 USD) to purchase new goods for resale. Makhsuda promises to pay the loan back on time and thanks all supporting her. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He stocks up with local wholesale merchants and then sells his goods retail, cash or credit accepted.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he envisions realizing a monthly profit if 80,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase his business capital, to assist with family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in his business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":415215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a variety of goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-03T20:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Drissa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873781,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763507,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152323,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991176,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021445,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746246,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778824,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961085,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699283,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":20949.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-04T11:01:57Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":148047,"name":"Gulnora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Y.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mavluda is 51 years old. She is married and the loving mother of two children. With the purpose of supporting her family, Mavluda is selling women\u2019s clothing. She has been in this business already for 15 years.

Mavluda would like to thank everyone supporting her and to ensure that she\u2019ll pay back the loan in a timely manner. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She will invest the rest in her business.<br>    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Carolyn McCaffrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":415227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy onions and potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T22:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":25727.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873782,"comment":null},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":25727.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763508,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25727.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152325,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25727.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991177,"comment":null},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25727.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021446,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25727.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746248,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-02T00:15:19Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":148055,"name":"Yodgor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yodgor G. is 26 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<\/em><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ikhtiyor is a family man who wishes to increase his business to be able to better support his family and offer them a better quality of life. Eight years ago, Ikhtiyor started by selling blankets and counterpanes (bedspreads).  His business has grown little by little and now offers greater variety and fashions. Today, Ikhtiyor has been working with Kiva partner IMON International for more than three years and feels very satisfied with the support offered to him because it has allowed him to increase his business, satisfy the needs of his customers and support his family. Ikhtiyor is asking to borrow $1,500 USD in order to purchase new goods. He wants to develop his business and increase his income to save money and create a better life for his family. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Rali is requesting a third loan from  ALID\u00e9 to grow her little business and her clientele so that she can better cater for the needs of her children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":474.88,"image":{"id":415257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of kola nuts, stove wicks, and local condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T19:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.12,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":17457.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735990,"comment":null},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":17457.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623501,"comment":null},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":17457.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020206,"comment":null},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":17457.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858699,"comment":null},{"amount":79.64,"local_amount":33533.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":35124.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495006,"comment":null},{"amount":39.54,"local_amount":16700,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":17492.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.12,"payment_id":136618848,"comment":null},{"amount":79.33,"local_amount":33400,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":34985.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151834933,"comment":null},{"amount":79.33,"local_amount":33400,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-28T07:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34985.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953784,"comment":null},{"amount":38.72,"local_amount":16300,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":17073.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347060,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T21:26:31Z","paid_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":148077,"name":"Yaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaa is a 40 year-old woman.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

started her fish business twenty years ago at a community market where she lives. She prepares and serves her customers very tasty fish and for that reason she has many fans.  She buys fish from Yeji in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana.  Yaa is 50 years-old, married and the mother of seven children. Two of her children are in school while the rest live independently. She supports her children from the business proceeds. She depends on that for their food, school bills and sometimes their medical bills.

is a 48-year-old trader. She is married and has one child, who is currently in school. She trades in lace materials, textiles and clothing materials. Lace material is very useful in room and office decorations.

She has been in food production for 35 years now in taking care of the family.\r\n\r\nAjaratu says demand for food is on the higher side but she does not have adequate funds for expansion.

They provided her with assistance so that she could move ahead in her business plans, for which she is very grateful, and in return she tries to help them with the household expenses.  When she had the opportunity to get into a line of work selling beauty products she did not hesitate to do so, as she always wanted to work independently in a way that would allow her not to neglect her infant son.  Thus, she has for some years been working selling beauty products around her district, and has had friends who she turned into customers who solicit her business daily.  What she likes best about this activity are the bonds of friendship that she maintains and the new ones she strikes up as she is constantly visiting her customers. Jessica believes that the profitability of her business rests on taking advantage of the product offers that are in the catalogs, because when she makes these sales she receives additional awards of product to increase her inventory.

He is married to DOSSOU Djomamou Joseline, a retailer, and is the father of four children who are all in school;  but in addition to his children, he has another child to support.  \r\n\r\nFor about 15 years, Eric Parfait has lived in Cocotomey, not far from Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  He alone is the one who covers the family expenses.  This is why he has been running a business for nine years selling religious items (engravings or reproductions, prayer books, rosaries, images of saints, etc.) to provide for his family.  He supplies himself in Nigeria, a country neighboring Benin, and in Cotonou.  \r\n\r\nTo expand his business and to increase his customer base, he\u2019s requesting a loan from ALID\u00e9.  His ambition is to open a second stall for selling his items. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

His wife has been a great support in helping him develop his small enterprise. \r\n\r\nHis goal is to be able to produce more blocks and thus provide a better quality of life for his family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":415600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchasing cement and sand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T23:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863403,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753097,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142151,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979553,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010552,"comment":null},{"amount":70.42,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734919,"comment":null},{"amount":254.58,"local_amount":4700,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4811.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768378,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

C. is from the village of Anonang, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 33 years old. Ledenisa is married and has two school-aged children. Ledenisa sells \"alimango\" (crabs) on a retail basis. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling crabs in the local community. Ledenisa has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ledenisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ledenisa is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional crabs to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Ledenisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to pay tuition for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crab products in the local community. Laurencia has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 3,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Laurencia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Laurencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Laurencia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Laurencia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>About GDMPC: <\/b> <\/p>\r\n<p>GDMPC is one of the most

She wanted to travel to another country to better her economic wellbeing like many others have done, but that would separate the family and decided to stay and work.  She takes care of a pension with the help of her family and of her sister who offered her the store that she now rents because she has the income to take care of the rent as well as the necessities of her family.\r\n<p>Mrs. Fatys\u2019 dream is to improve her business by providing new dishes since the store is very well located.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva
