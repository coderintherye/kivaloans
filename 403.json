Chheun V. is a 37-year-old fisherman and father, blessed with five children, all of whom are attending the public high school. In addition to his fishing business, he uses his old motorcycle to deliver passers-by around the community for a fee.

Acal Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita A. is from the village of Mangidkid. She is 53 years old. Carmelita is the group leader of a 2-member group taking out a loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarmelita is married and has 10 adult children. To make a living, Carmelita owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Carmelita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase ingredients needed to make products for sale. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 21st loan taken out by Carmelita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":542971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Tagab Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalia T. is from the village of Mangidkid. She is 68 years old. Rosalia is the group leader of a 2-member group taking out a loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosalia is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalia raises livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Rosalia has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Rosalia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Rosalia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which she will use to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 18th loan taken out by Rosalia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Kasifa is widowed with six children and only two of her children go to school. She also takes care of additional family members.  Kasifa sells yellow bananas in Nakawa market, one of the markets in Kampala City. She uses public transport to and from home. Kasifa buys from her place of work from delivery vans, which bring the bananas from the villages.  She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches and clusters of yellow bananas. Kasifa has been in this business for over 20 years and with MCDT for nine years. She pays daily market dues of 1,000\/=. She works seven days a week.  Her major business challenge is that of the rainy season because she works from an open place.

He is a farmer in Nkubu town in Eastern Kenya.\r\n\r\nGodfrey has been farming for two years and his main product is bananas which he sells to the local market. He relies solely on the income from his farming activities to cater for his family's needs. His main challenge in this business is the low price of bananas, especially during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nGodfrey has requested this KES 46,800 loan from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This loan will improve his family's living standard because, with the income from selling milk, he will be able to construct a house and the family will have enough milk for consumption.\r\n\r\nIn future, Godfrey plans to acquire more cows and construct a zero-grazing shed (to raise improved breeds of livestock under confined conditions in order to make better use of limited land area, feed and organic resources). He plans to lease more banana plantation land to increase his income.\r\n\r\nGodfrey says that Juhudi loans are repaid monthly and this gives him ample time to look for money compared to other organizations where they repay weekly.

He also intends to use KES.5,000 to purchase a bull. This loan will enable him to practice large scale farming without straining financially. His biggest challenge has been poor roads that delay transportation of products to the market.

She has a vast clientele and is well-known. \r\n \r\nWishing to satisfy her ever-growing clientele, she came to Soro Yiriwaso, with whom she has been working for 42 months, having received three solidarity loans and two individual loans, all of which have been reimbursed. She is on her third individual loan which she plans to use to buy three truckloads of wood for construction. She gets her wood in the forest called 'de la Faya', on the road to Bamako, from rural people's organizations charged with managing this forest. \r\n\r\nMrs.  Koura Deb\u00e9l\u00e9 sells for cash or credit to a clientele composed of masons, construction firms, and such. With this loan she hopes to make a profit of 120,000 F CFA which will be used to cover certain family expenses and pay off her debts. Her ambition is to build a residential house for her family.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

people can see the future clearly through a cloudy, chaotic present. That describes our client Darnell. In the midst of the country's financial situation in early 2008, Darnell saw an opportunity to help others move ahead of chaos and began his business consulting practice.\r\n\r\nAs a consultant to small businesses, Darnell\u2019s advice has helped turn businesses around \u2013 instead of losing money, businesses become profitable. What is most important to him about his work is that these businesses can keep people from losing their jobs and even generate more jobs. While Darnell certainly enjoys getting paid to help small business owners improve their companies, helping employees keep their jobs is, in many ways, even better.\r\n\r\nDarnell is also helping his clients\u2019 businesses become socially responsible by \u201cgreening\u201d their practices and missions. He helps the less-advantaged parts of his community through donating \"pro bono\" (without charge) consulting services. He feels that the education his company imparts to others through its consulting is a worthwhile, meaningful contribution to his community.\r\n\r\nDarnell will use his ACCION USA loan to hire additional employees, expanding his current staff of five. So many clients have been happy with his services, and have referred other clients to Darnell, that he is now able to grow his business. So while helping other companies grow and expand, Darnell gets to do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9575,"image":{"id":541481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To hire

The majority of the group members left their villages to live in the city in order to support their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":543312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Commercial Activity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Mbour","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.5 -17","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-05-21T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safietou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nogaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady Aidara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971394,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708682,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922713,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189228,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484647,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620891,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T13:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758464,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-01T11:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495367,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923339,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50472.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365760,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T02:32:06Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202200,"name":"C2150 Abadatana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Souzan is 23 years old and is single.

He dreams of seeing his children educated to university level just as many Ugandans now wish, having realized the significance of education.\r\n\r\nAramanzani has been obtaining credit from HOFOKAM through which he has been able to finish building his residential house and also buy a motorcycle for his motorcycle transport business. Besides the business, he also deals in produce and farming as he tries to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nThis is Aramanzani\u2019s fourth loan from HOFOKAM. He intends to use the loan to buy another motorcycle for his transport business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":543301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She quit that job after 19 years, but has worked as an independent surgical seamstress since 2005.  Carmen currently operates her business out of her home.

Some time ago he decided to move there and got a job as a construction worker.  He stayed but comes every December to visit his wife and 12 year old son who remained in the parish of Picoaza in the Manab\u00ed province.  Neither the distance nor bad times have prevented them from staying in contact, Nancy says.  \r\n\r\nIt has not been easy at all for Nancy to be alone, and she has had to face difficult moments. Besides being a great homemaker and an excellent mother, Nancy doesn't like to be idle, so she decided to sell Avon beauty products.  For a number of years now, the loans from the Foundation have helped her because she has been able to have her own capital to invest in the products. Having her own investment has helped her financially. \r\n\r\nNancy tells us that when husband lived here, he worked for the Diario Manabita and she was a housewife, but once he emigrated things changed.  Her 12 year old son needs many things for school and she tries to ensure that he has everything he needs, because her dream is to see him be successful.  For this reason she has thrown herself into sales.  Even with how difficult it is to sells these products due to competition, she has been able to generate sales.  She tries to help the customer whenever possible.  She lets them pay weekly so that they can make their payments.   \r\n\r\nHer biggest selling products are perfumes and makeup, which is what she will purchase with this loan.  One of Nancy's dreams is to complete her education.  She only finished high school and she would like to study early childhood education.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":542806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Avon products such as perfume, makeup, cosmetics ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Nancy Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":385,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892509,"comment":null},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632855,"comment":null},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T13:04:44Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202255,"name":"Wirman Iraldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wirman de 54 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona periurbana de Guayaquil, su esposa le ayuda en la tienda (aparece en la foto), con ella tiene dos hijos de 3 y 9 a\u00f1os, por la falta de oportunidades y la idea de tener su propio negocio el invirti\u00f3 sus ahorros en v\u00edveres y construyo un local afuera de su casa para ubicar su tienda. \n\nPoco a poco el fue comparando v\u00edveres, como aceite y arroz para su tienda, con ayuda y dedicaci\u00f3n de su esposa ha podido salir a adelante, trabaja desde las 06h00 hasta las 22h00pm todos los d\u00edas.

He lives in his mother's house along with his smaller brothers.  What he wants most is to improve his quality of life.  He works arduously every day in his fields.  Federico tries to change the life that he has at present.  Along with his mother he sows beans, corn, maize and potatoes bi-annually, which he sells in the markets of Tarma and la Merced, since it is there that he obtains better profits.  He has been doing this activity for 15 years and considers that he likes to protect his crops from plagues.  Without doubt, the most difficult thing is to carry his crop to the markets where he sells them, since the bags that he carries are very heavy.  His hope is to improve the quality of his products and thus to obtain a better income.  This is his second loan with MFP.  He feels that this loan will be very beneficial for him in his growth as a farmer.  In his communal group he is a supportive and very active associate.

the Damas en Progreso community bank for 2 loan cycles. She is a mother of two and has been married for 4 years. She and her husband met in Guayas province, got married and settled in the city of Portoviejo.\r\nA friend encouraged her to join the community bank, and she is very satisfied with working with credit in her business. She sells rice in little sacks and has a small store in her own home. Her husband takes charge of the business, and travels to Guayas to buy rice in quintals (100 kg measurements) from distributors. They have done this for 1 year and it is going very well. Every day they set up a table outside of their house and sell rice by the pound, or however the client requests it.\r\nWith this loan, Mayra will be able to invest in more rice. Every week her husband has to travel and invest in 30 bags of rice; once they have it, they weigh it and divide it into different bags, depending on demand. They sell it all.\r\nIt is wonderful to know that her business is going well. It gives Mayra time to take care of their children, who are 2 and 4. She works for them: to be able to achieve the dream of owning their own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":542748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892518,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632864,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846898,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113359,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406917,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:48Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406918,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T00:47:41Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202291,"name":"Rossi Melva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nRossi tiene 48 a\u00f1os D. edad, es casada y vive junto a su esposo en el distrito D.

is a 46-year-old mother of seven who lives in Calle Blancos, San Jose, located in the central valley of Costa Rica. She lives with her husband, colleague and son.\r\n\r\nThe loan officer that has been working with Adelaida describes her as a woman with a fighting spirit. Despite difficult circumstances, she has managed to raise her children independently, harnessing her sewing skills to earn an income. She has worked as a seamstress for the past eighteen years and has great ambition to improve her standard of living and that of her children.\r\n\r\nAdeilada currently works with three sewing machines, which she has acquired one by one over the years. These machines have served her well in the past; however, they are now dated and no longer suit her production needs. For this reason, she is applying for a loan with Fundacion Mujer, to purchase two new sewing machines in an effort to increase her productive capacity.\r\n\r\nAdeilada has a sewing workshop that she runs out of a rented house in Calle Blancos. Her main client is a local business named Greenbag that calls her when it has work for her to do.

She is 42 years old. Lilibeth is married and has three school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Lilibeth owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Lilibeth has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for this activity. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Lilibeth joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Lilibeth has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Lilibeth is requesting a new loan of 40000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Lilibeth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Tuyabang Bajo, Oroquieta City. She is 59 years old. Anita is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Anita owns and operates a hog fattening business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Anita has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Anita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Anita is requesting a new loan of 14900 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Anita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Her day begins early in the morning, when she milks the cows and takes the milk for sale. For fifteen years the milk has provided her an income of around five thousand soms per month. This isn\u2019t a whole lot of money  considering the fact that she\u2019s got three children, so for the past year she has been trying to find herself an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nAside from the cattle, Ainura has all manner of poultry, and some sheep and bulls.  If the need arises, she can take her cattle to the bazaar and sell them to get money for everyday needs or emergencies.  She has a preschooler right now and she realizes that before long her expenses will go up, so, she and her husband, who has farming experience from way back, decided that they would raise crops, too.  It was quite a significant decision because they were at the point of really needing to diversify their sources of income.  \r\n\r\nAinura and her husband have managed to expand their herd of cattle, fix up their house and substantially improve their living conditions.  Ainura goes about her work gamely, too, knowing that she\u2019ll always have the support she needs from her husband, who helps her diligently with the business and sticks by her side.  She needs a loan at this time to get the items she needs for farming.\r\n\r\nAinura\u2019s partners in the group are:\r\n\r\nAinura M. is thirty-eight, married, and has five children.  Her eldest son is twenty and the youngest is only a year and a half old.  She raises cattle and sells the milk.  Her husband is a cab driver.  Not long ago, she and her husband started raising crops and now they are in need of a loan so they can proceed to work their land.\r\n\r\nDinara Z. is twenty-nine and the mother of three children.  Her husband works in law-enforcement and she\u2019s a hair stylist.  Recently she and her husband began the huge undertaking of building a barn.  Now they really need building materials, but their combined incomes don\u2019t suffice.  They really need the loan.\r\n\r\nZholochu A. is forty-four-years-old and the father of five children.  In order to feed his family he raises and sells sheep.  His wife works at a vodka factory.  Three of the children are preschool and school-aged, so Zholochu decided that he would farm, too.

Florence is married with five children and four of her children go to school. The fifth one is still young.  Florence doesn\u2019t take care of additional family members.  Florence owns a stall in Kalerwe selling tomatoes and onions. She wants to use this loan to buy more boxes of tomatoes and onions.  She has been in this business for three years and with MCDT for one and one half years, servicing her third loan. Besides this tomato business, she owns bicycles for hire. Florence sells to all categories of people at retail and wholesale.  Florence works seven days a week.

is 27 years old. He is married and has a one-year-old child. He is a farmer from Eastern Kenya near Nkubu. Patrick has beeen farming for six years; his product is bananas which he sells to the middlemen who later sell them to the local market. He also operates a shop in the same area.\r\n\r\nHe recently completed repayment of a previous loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 40,000 KES and has requested a new loan for 80,000 KES to constuct a better cowshed and upgrade his banana farming. The income from this loan will help him buy more land and later buy a car that will help boost his income.\r\n\r\nHis main challenges in farming are the low banana prices during the rainy season and natural hazards, like wind which causes banana stems to break. He plans to start potato farming bacause he has already identified a ready market for it.\r\n\r\nHe says that Juhudi gives loans through the group-guarantee mechanism and this makes it easier to access credit to boost his farming."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":543667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To construct a cow shed and upgrade his banana farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-05-21T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.87,"local_amount":9200,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":9388.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159661004,"comment":null},{"amount":112.75,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8980.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166875284,"comment":null},{"amount":125.56,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10001.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142257,"comment":null},{"amount":112.75,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8980.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437087,"comment":null},{"amount":112.75,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8980.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576483,"comment":null},{"amount":87.12,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6939.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712233,"comment":null},{"amount":356.2,"local_amount":27800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":28370.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450027,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-24T13:31:55Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:19:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202446,"name":"Ferdinand","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ferdinand A. is from the village of Tumpagon, Cagayan de oro City.
