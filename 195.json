About a year ago he got engaged to his girlfriend.  He lives in a rented house. Since he is an artist who specializes in painting he moved to the city of Lima.  He thought he was going to become a successful painter there. However, things did not turn out the way he hoped. He got in contact with artisans who make a living by selling crafts. He is from San Pedro de Cajas which is located in the city of Tarma, and is known as the cradle of artisans. His contacts helped him to become an artisan. So he decided to move back to his village and he got some money to start his own business. Now he is really happy with the activity he is doing because he gets more time to paint. He still goes to Lima to drop off paintings and his crafts to sell. He has been able to increase the number of customers that buy from him, but his greatest limitation is money.  His business is getting more and more profitable and he needs money to invest in it.  Luis is the president of his communal bank named \"San Pedro\". His asking for a loan of $650 to increase his capital for his business. He will use the money to buy the materials he needs for the paintings that he is selling in Lima.\r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Sonia of San Roque High School)<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by San Roque School, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":292732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase merchandise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T20:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2017.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123947,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T22:02:51Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97143,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucy tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja y padre de sus 4 hijos en una casa alquilada.

Este trabajo lo desarrolla por m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os, lo que le ha permitido ganarse el reconocimiento de sus paisanos por tal habilidad. En el mes de marzo los tapices son muy rentables, pero su dificultad mayor es la falta de dinero para producir en grandes cantidades, por ello teje solo a pedido, por el que le adelantan la cuarta parte del precio. El trabajo de esta pareja de artesanos les sirve para solventar los gastos dom\u00e9sticos y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.

They are both artisans\u2014her husband makes blankets and comforters with a large weaver and she is a specialist in small wall hangings, made with a small weaver.  Lucy does not need the help of any paintings or pictures to make the varied combinations of colors and designs on her wall hangings.  She says she has all of the designs in her mind and only needs to concentrate.  She has been making textiles for more than 20 years, and her abilities have earned her the recognition of her peers.  In the month of March her pieces are very profitable, but her greatest difficulty is that she lacks the money to produce large quantities.  For large orders, she only makes custom orders and requires one fourth of the cost up front.  The work of this artisan couple allows them to pay their household expenses and to provide an education for their children.  In earlier loan cycles, Lucy was the spokeswoman for her community bank, where she successfully completed her required duties.  This is her 3rd loan with MFP and she has always been responsible with her payments.  The money that she is asking for will be used to buy materials to make more wall hangings, since Easter is coming up and there is more demand for her work.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":292734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"Weaving materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123948,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T23:48:12Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97144,"name":"Rita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita is 49 years old and married with six children.

For 7 years, she has lived with her partner and father of her 2 children.  Currently they live in a rented house.  For 12 years, she has produced potatoes, peas, and corn, mostly on rented plots of land.  She trieds to plant in different places with diverse temperatures so her harvests can alternate.  Her husband is in charge of carrying out the most difficult work; above all his presence during the harvest season is indispensable.  Her potato harvest has yielded very good results thanks to the good market price, but corn is in a bad period because the prices have dropped a lot.  This is why she has decided to postpone its harvest until the prices improve.  This is why she is preparing 2 plots of land to plant peas.  She will plant them in different stages to avoid having all of her production earn less money if prices fall.  Hilda is very happy with being a farmer because this work allows them to support their family.  She is the secretary of her communal bank, and she has had this position for two consecutive cycles.  She is working with a lot of efficiency.  This is her eighth loan with MFP.  During this time she has not defaulted.

At the moment she lives at her godmother's house.  It has been 5 years since she started making a living by selling processed wool.  She brings the processed wool directly from Lima and she sells it at 12 Soles per Kilo.  She also buys tapistries and every time she travels to the capital she offers them to her clients.  Her business generates a good source of income for her when she travels to and from the capital.  She is really happy being a dynamic woman that is capable of running a business.  Her goal is to save up some money and buy her own home where she can continue her work.  Right now she rents a space for her business from her godmother.  Deyci is one of MFP's clients.  She decided to be part of a communal bank because one of her friends invited her and told Deyci about the methods they teach that help people to improve their businesses.

She lives in her parent's home right now with her daughter.  About three years ago she worked as a seamstress in a large company in Lima, Peru, but when she got pregnant with her daughter she returned to her town so that she could take care of her daughter.  Her daughter's father left her.  Her parents took her into their home and she feels so thankful for her parents.  She started to help with the family business, which is a small store that sells groceries.  However, she was not able to make enough money so her father let her use some land that was perfect for raising guinea pigs.  When she started out raising the animals, she put a lot of time and money into the business.  She especially invested a lot of money in purchasing feed for the animals.  Little by little she began increasing the number of guinea pigs that she raised.  Now she realizes that the breed of guinea pigs that she started raising is not the best and their meat is not the most sought after.  This is why she would like to hire a consultant that could help her to improve her business.  She wants to become recognized in her area for selling guinea pigs.  This is her third loan with MFP and she is the treasurer of her communal bank.  She has demonstrated that she works hard, does a good job as the treasurer and that she makes her payments on time.  The money that she is asking for will be used to buy guinea pigs that are of a better breed and to pay for a professional agricultural consultant so that she can improve her business.\r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Alexis of San Roque High School)\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by San Roque School, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":292749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy guinea pigs that are of a better breed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T19:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorkas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1862.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123949,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T21:45:20Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97154,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ANA MAR\u00cdA P.

It is a co-educational school. Until last academic year, the school had only Junior Secondary School I \u2013 III (JSS I \u2013 III). Now, it has been elevated to a Senior Secondary School with only class IV (Senior Secondary School I) for a start.\r\n\r\nAhmadiyya Agriculture Secondary School makes good grades every academic year at the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE).

Some engage in businesses or agriculture, and others have organized extra classes for the pupils (though this is a practice the government is trying to abolish). Teachers are seeking a loan in order to embark on meaningful projects and then, out of their salaries, they will gradually repay the loan.\r\n\r\nAlusine H. S.

Staffing is also a problem facing the school. It lacks enough trained and qualified teachers to meet the growing number of pupils.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for teachers of the B.E.C. Primary School from SMT\/Kiva. This loan will certainly be of immense help to these teachers. Since salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone, especially for people in the teaching profession, they could not use their salaries to buy or do anything great. But with a loan, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time. Some of them will use it to begin or continue building a house, others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use it to invest in businesses in order to complement their monthly salaries. Still others will use it to buy furniture.\r\n\r\nIrene M. C.

She is fifty years old and married with four children. Two of her children are grown, one is in college and the other is in Junior Secondary School III (JSS III). She has been a head teacher of this school for over five years. Irene will invest this loan in her business. It will enable her to expand her business. She sells cigarettes, sugar, soft drinks, rice and so on.

It was established in 1923 by the Catholic Mission to spread education and religious doctrine. The school has a total number of 570 pupils and a staff of thirteen teachers. The school produces good results at the National Primary School Exams (NPSE). They also organize sports and thanks giving every academic year for the pupils.\r\n\r\nSome of the major challenges facing this school are the late receipt of school fee subsidies from the government, the belated arrival of the teaching materials and the inadequate seating accommodations for the pupils.\r\n\r\nTeachers and other professional workers come to SMT to seek loans for different reasons. Since salaries are usually very small, they are prompted to engage in businesses to supplement their meager salaries. Some cannot run a business for themselves directly; rather, they will invest whatever little they have into their wives\u2019 businesses. Others seek a loan in order to pursue further studies or to pay school fees for their children. There will also be some who will want a loan to buy pieces of furniture like chairs or a bed, and some will want to either start building a house or continue with a house building project they have already begun. It is for some of these reasons that teachers at St. Raphael have come to SMT to seek a loan. \r\n\r\nSylvanus A. K. (left) is the head of this group. He has been in the teaching profession for thirty years. He was born in Waterloo, twenty miles (32 km) from Freetown. He is fifty years old and married to a businesswoman. They have seven children between the ages of seven and twenty-one. With this loan, Mr. K. will buy house-building materials such as doors and windows. He has already started building the house and only the doors and windows are lacking for the completion of the house. This loan will certainly enable Mr. K. to achieve his dream of completing his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":292925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To supplement their salaries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T22:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sylvanus A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabinty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphenus A.

She is a chicken breeder. Her husband, Mr. Uk Ratana, is a farmer who owns a piece of land used to cultivate rice. Aside from this plantation, he is a construction worker. Although they try to work hard, they still earn less income than needed to support their household better.

Mr. Sokea K.,  aged  27, is the leader of the group. He is a construction worker. His wife, Mrs. Hout Sambath, is a fruit seller in the local market. Since her business is doing well, she wants to expand it to earn more income. Thus, Mr. Sokea K. decided to ask for a loan to buy more fruit to resell. Mrs. Samnang C. does not come to take a loan but her husband is taking a loan, so she is shown in the picture instead of him. \r\n\r\nThree members in this group  are taking end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.

loan for various purposes. Mrs. Phatt S. is a 52-year-old village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land used to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Neang Hor, is a thresher who owns a threshing machine. In his business, he faces an obstacle because he does not have enough money to buy gasoline for his threshing machine. In order to deal with this problem, Mrs. Phatt S. decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She has two children; one works in a garment factory and one stays at home to do housework. \r\n\r\nNine members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Rany N. lives in Hang Heng village in Takeo province. She is a grocer. Her husband, Mr. Phen Sophorn, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. Aside from this plantation, he grows mushrooms near his house.

Tenia un buen vivir alli, ganaba buen dinero el cual guardaba y un porcentaje lo enviaba a los familiares aqu\u00ed. Despues de un tiempo le avisaron que el marido tenia graves problemas de la vista, entonces tuvo que dejar todo y emprender su viaje de vuelta.

She runs a general store out of her home.  She worked in the United States for a long time, caring for an elderly person.  She had a good life there and she earned a good salary that she saved and would send a percentage of her money to her family here (in Paraguay).  Later, she was notified that her husband has serious problems with his sight, so she had to leave the U.S. and return home.  When she arrived she found herself in a delicate situation, as her husband had almost lost his sight.

From a young age he demonstrated a talent for agriculture.  He has always tried to be very responsible and today he has a crop of 25-30 sacks of potatoes that he grows in transitional fields.  He also grows beans and corn in irrigated fields.  Aquiles is very content with his farmwork.  When he finishes caring for his crops, he goes to help his father, because he wants to repay his father\u2019s efforts.  What his father likes best out of the whole agricultural process is the marketing, because he always hopes to get a good price for his crops.  But once he gets to the market, he gets a little clumsy and sometimes loses track of the accounting.  Aquiles always tries to help him out with some pointers.  Aquiles is the president of his community bank and this is his 8th loan with MFP.  In all of this time he has proven to be very responsible, both in his duties and in his payments.  The  loan he is asking for is to purchase fertilizer for his varied crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":293317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aquiles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3066.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080290,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T20:47:15Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97424,"name":"Ashurbi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\n \u0425\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430  \u0410\u0448\u0443\u0440\u0431\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0434\u0430\u0442. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 49 \u043b\u0435\u0442 , \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439.\u0414\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430 , \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0425\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0443 , \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c , \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c.\u041f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 12 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432.","en":" Ashurbi H. is a resident of the city of Vahdat.

After she separated from her husband, her bean and potato crops decreased.  Since her children do not like doing farm work, she relies on the help of her nieces and nephews to plant her crops.  Working in agriculture has given her great satisfaction and with her earnings she was able to build a home out of basic materials.  However, the constant rains caused one of the walls to fall down.  Now she needs to put in a strong foundation and begin building again.  By continuing to plant her fields she has also been able to feed her children and pay for their education.  For the past three years she also has sold vegetables and cheese that she takes to a market in the jungle to sell every Friday.

At 9:00 am they ate and then spent the whole day working in the fields.  Today Vilma and her husband grow potatoes, beans, corn and peas.  They mostly grow potatoes because they have buyers that come in and harvest their fields.  They prefer to sell their crops by the field so they avoid the chore of selecting and preparing the potatoes.  They earn a smaller profit, but they save a lot of time.  This couple is very happy working on the land, digging out each row with care.  The hope that the market prices remain stable until they finish harvesting the rest of their fields, so they can recover some of the money they invested in fertilizer.  Right now they are also preparing some fields for other people, with the hope of saving enough to buy more land.  Vilma is very responsible and this is her 8th loan with MFP.

She lives in her own home and her only son, Renato, is studying in another country.  For the past 13 years she has worked in her food stand in the Huamantanga market, one of the busiest markets in the Puente Piedra district in the city of Lima.  The work is very hard but happily Domitila has some help\u2014she hired two young women to help her work in the kitchen.  She likes her job a lot and is always thinking of new ways to improve her business.  Because of this she has a loyal group of customers who always come to her food stand.  Domitila is absorbed in her work and says that it is necessary to work a lot in order to achieve the things we want.  Happily, her efforts are not in vain, since her food stand generates a good income and allows her to work happily  in peace.  During the summer, the heat means that people will buy a lot of beer from her, so she wants to purchase more beer in order to generate more income in the future.  Domitila has been working with MFP for several years, but this is her first loan outside of her community bank.  She hopes to continue working and generating income in order to repay her loan on time.  With this loan she will buy cases of beer and with the profits she earns from selling the beer in the summer, she will stock her food stand for the fall.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":293330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase drinks to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T22:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":161.74},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":170.24},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175.47},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":184.07},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":190.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":197.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":207.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":213.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.49},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.79},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.91,"local_amount":161.74,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":169.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012334,"comment":null},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":170.24,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":178.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595923,"comment":null},{"amount":58.49,"local_amount":175.47,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":183.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990186,"comment":null},{"amount":61.36,"local_amount":184.07,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":192.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211311,"comment":null},{"amount":63.44,"local_amount":190.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":199.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640825,"comment":null},{"amount":66.93,"local_amount":200.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":210.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080294,"comment":null},{"amount":68.03,"local_amount":204.08,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":213.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996507,"comment":null},{"amount":71.09,"local_amount":213.29,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":223.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842013,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T23:45:50Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97432,"name":"Vladimir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"His family has 2.73 ha of agricultural land, which he received from privatization.

They have a transportation service with different routes around Lima.  He is the driver and she collects money from the passengers.  With this work they have supported their household for the past 8 years and they both like the work since it allows them to be together the whole day.  However, the work is tiring and many times the passengers are not kind.  These are difficulties that they have learned to overcome and they earn decent money, since the route they drive is very busy and their minibus is always full of passengers.  Unfortunately they do not own the minibus and they hope to purchase their own minibus in the future.  This is Iris\u2019 first loan with MFP, she was encouraged by a friend to take out a loan with the group.  She hopes to be very punctual with her payments.  With the loan money she will repair some damages and tears to the seats in the bus, in order to offer a better service for their customers.  She would also like to buy some school supplies for her daughter since the school year is beginning.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":293332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"Make repairs to her minibus","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":78.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012335,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":78.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595924,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":78.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990187,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":78.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211312,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":78.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640826,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":78.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080295,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":78.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996508,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":78.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842014,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T22:15:41Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97434,"name":"Loveth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loveth is a single parent who cares for her four children.

She has a store located in her home which makes it easier for her to care for her children at the same time as the business, particularly little Joswan who still needs to be watched over.  Her eldest daughter, who has a baby of her own and who is pictured (her mother had gone out to buy merchandise) also helps Mar\u00eda taking care of the business when she needs to go out; thanks to her help she has been able to stock up in order to take care of the customers.  Mar\u00eda enjoys serving her clients very much as it requires a great deal of patience, a quality she has plenty of.  Her store is always busy and the goods she offers sell out quickly.  Because of this she needs to go out to buy more merchandise, during which times she leaves her daughter in charge of the business.  Katherine is very happy to help her mother because the business benefits the entire family and in the future she hopes to continue workings so that her mother's business grows a lot more.

They live in their own home with their five children: Wilmer, 18, Luis, 16, Pedro, 14, Jhosep, 12, and Edson, 3.  She works embroidering dresses in her home.  Her business consists of decorating dresses that her friend buys in bulk.  She decorates with beads, sequins, and stones.  She is then paid a set amount of money for each dress.  So that she does not have work pile up, Liliana has her friends help with some of the work so they can decorate dresses and then she pays them a percentage of her pay.  She likes her job very much since she can employ all of her creativity, and also because the earnings are immediate.  Even so, she would like to have something more stable that she could run from her home, and so she has thought about installing a small grocery store.  This would allow her to spend more time with her family and generate more income.  Liliana is now in her third loan with Microfinanzas Prismo, having been very punctual and responsible with the payments.  She is also very happy with her community bank.  With the money she is requesting she will buy more dress decorating materials to be able to earn enough to start her grocery store.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":293352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy embroidery materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012337,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595926,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990189,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211314,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640828,"comment":null},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":104.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080297,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-25T00:07:23Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97447,"name":"Mujeres Trabajadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Comit\u00e9 se formo hace 3 a\u00f1os gracias a la Sra.

The group its in its ninth loan cycle.  \r\n\r\nAs an example we can describe, Mrs. Cecilia C., 45 years old, who has 4 sons that stay at home with their older brother while she goes to work as a hair stylist as well as selling Kalua brand underwear.  In the morning, she visits her clients to offer them her merchandise and in the afternoon she is in the beauty salon.  She has been doing this for some time now and is her main source of income to support and educate her sons.  She stands out for her good treatment of the other group members and that's why they designated her as the president of the group, a job that she executes efficiently without neglecting her other activities.  We can add that upon her job as a hair stylist it was difficult to form a stable client base, which caused her to have various economic problems, but with time, and thanks to her effort and constant training she was able to make it through.  In one of her interviews and weekly meetings, she says \"I thank Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for helping me and my family to progress, as well as my community\".  \r\n\r\nGroup Members:\r\n\r\nCecilia C. \t     Hair Stylist\r\nMercedes H.

","en":"Rosario is 62 years old and lives with her husband Bernardo in a house that was left to her by her parents. She is a very happy and charismatic woman who runs a small shop in her home. In addition to groceries, Rosario's shop sells clothing that she makes by hand, utilizing a skill she learned as a child. She also gives classes in crocheting and handicrafts to elderly people at the local hospital, helping them feel more useful. Her \u201cold folks,\u201d as she affectionately calls them, love her, as she is always very kind and overflowing with happiness. It is easy to love Rosario, as her magnetic personality has this effect on everyone who knows her. Because of this, she has a very large clientele and that makes for a very profitable business. In the future, Rosario would like to have a large shop where she can sell smoothies, juices, and other items. For this, she will need to expand her storefront.\r\n<p>\r\nRosario is a very loyal client of Microfinanzas PRISMA, and has already received many loans. This is her first loan as an individual, not as a member of a community bank, and she promises to be very punctual in its repayment. With this loan she will purchase a railing to expand her shop outside and will install tables so that her customers can enjoy their purchases in the open air. This will enable her to have more space and more security.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":293356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Expand her shop to provide better customer service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-25T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":137.65},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":143.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":154.34},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":154.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":174.87},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":180.98},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":186.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":193.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.6},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.85},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.73,"local_amount":137.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":140.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012338,"comment":null},{"amount":46.3,"local_amount":142.46,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":145.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595927,"comment":null},{"amount":46.6,"local_amount":143.38,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":146.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990190,"comment":null},{"amount":50.17,"local_amount":154.34,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":157.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211315,"comment":null},{"amount":50.21,"local_amount":154.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":157.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640829,"comment":null},{"amount":77.37,"local_amount":238.07,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":243.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080298,"comment":null},{"amount":30.2,"local_amount":92.91,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":94.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996510,"comment":null},{"amount":56.83,"local_amount":174.87,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":178.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842016,"comment":null},{"amount":247.59,"local_amount":761.82,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":778.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733771,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

They live in large traditional extended families in the Hamdallaye district of the city of Koutiala (Sikasso Region, Republic of Mali).  They know one another through community ties and do almost the same work selling clothing of all kinds (for men, women, and children) and fruit and vegetables. \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to satisfy the needs of their ever-growing customer base, the group members decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their ninth solidarity loan (group loan).  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n<p>\r\nThe members intend to use this loan to buy vegetables and novel items (in-style clothing) in order to satisfy their ever-demanding customers.  Supplies of damask fabrics are gotten in Bamako (capital of Mali);  embroidery, from Lom\u00e9 (capital of togo);  light weight fabrics for men, from Burkina Faso.  As for the vegetables, they are gotten on an ongoing basis at the Sikasso market as they are sold.  The clothing is sold in and around the city of Koutiala, where the group members have loyal customers. \r\n<p>\r\nThey each hope to realize an average monthly profit of 155,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in their commerce by expanding their enterprise with the opening of a clothing shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":293371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy clothing and vegetables  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":126432.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033755,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126432.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621122,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":126432.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621123,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126432.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020088,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126432.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242837,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":126432.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678467,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-09T23:21:23Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97461,"name":"Lidia Mercedes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lidia Mercedes is a happily married, 43-year old micro-business entrepreneur.

began her business because she previously worked in a fabric store and liked the work. So, five years ago she decided to open her own business and started a stationery store in her home. She began by making copies with a photocopier and sold pencils, notebooks, and other common items. Her business did well, and she has since made renovations to her home to provide better facilities for her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nLaura is requesting a loan for 5,000 Mexican pesos, to be repaid in five months. With the loan, she will purchase merchandise to be able to continue expanding her business.

Mr. Ti\u00e9moko sells from his home, in the big open-air market of Koutiala, and in the weekly fairs of the surrounding villages to a clientele constituted of women and men, for cash or on credit. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Ti\u00e9moko expects to have a profit of 80,000 F CFA per month which he will use to reimburse the interest on the loan and cover a good part of his family expenses.

Mr. Kargbo will use his loan to buy house building materials like cements and corrugated iron zincs. This will enable him start building a house and with the help of subsequent loans, he is optimistic that he will be able to complete building a house for himself and children. \r\n\r\nRC Teko School was established by the Roman Catholics in 1977 with the aim of educating the children of military personnel at the Makeni Military barracks, Teko, and to spread the Roman Catholic faith. RC Teko is divided into a Lower and Upper primary schools respectively. The Lower is made up of classes I \u2013 III and the Upper is made of classes IV \u2013 V.

She started off by selling vegetables, but she abandoned this business because she didn't earn a lot of profits.  Now she buys and sells cows, pigs, and guinea pigs.  At harvest time she also buys and sells cereal and potatoes.  She has her business at her home.

She works in an internet cafe that she installed in her home, and normally works there all day long, however, she gets more business in the afternoon and night.  Hers is the only such business in the area, and because she is close to a high school, the children and teenagers wait in line to use the computers.  For this reason she is planning to expand her business and buy more computers to satisfy all of her clientele and continue to grow little by little.  She also has another business.  Thanks to her hard work she was able to buy a car, and this car is rented out Monday through Friday earning good income.  Her oldest son uses the car for work on the weekends, and for this reason she has thought about buying another car to have more income.  Belinda has many business ideas but she needs the capital to permit her to change her thoughts into reality.  With the money she is requesting she will buy used computers for her internet cafe, and, if possible, make a down payment on another car.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":293610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To buy computers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":169.1},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":177.97},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":184.21},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":188.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":195.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":205.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":209.65},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":217.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":227.35},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":235.03},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":240.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":249.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.9},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.11,"local_amount":169.1,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":170.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012339,"comment":null},{"amount":56.95,"local_amount":177.97,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":179.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595928,"comment":null},{"amount":58.95,"local_amount":184.21,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":185.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990191,"comment":null},{"amount":60.27,"local_amount":188.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":189.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211316,"comment":null},{"amount":62.44,"local_amount":195.13,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":196.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640830,"comment":null},{"amount":65.9,"local_amount":205.95,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":207.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080299,"comment":null},{"amount":67.09,"local_amount":209.65,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":210.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996511,"comment":null},{"amount":69.51,"local_amount":217.23,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":218.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842017,"comment":null},{"amount":304.78,"local_amount":952.43,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":958.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733772,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Furthermore, she has set up a display case in her mother's general store, to better exhibit her products, and she has received more orders. Jessica is very pleased with her job because it allows her to generate extra income on top of what her husband earns, so she can treat herself to personal pleasures, as she says, and improve the economic situation of her household. In the future she would like to have a boutique in her home and increase her earnings. This is her second loan through Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma, and she has been very punctual with her payments. Furthermore, the community bank she works with, called \"Cristo Morado\", is very helpful to her business.

Con el dinero que solicita comprar\u00e1 arroz, az\u00facar y diez cajas de bebidas, adem\u00e1s de comprar \u00fatiles escolares para este periodo de inicio escolar. ","en":"Rosa is 22 years old.  She lives in her own home with her partner, Jos\u00e9, a mechanic. Their 2 children, Jhony who is 28, and Khaty who is 22 live with them; their grown daughter Jessica, 27, has started her own family.  For the last 12 years Rosa has taken care of her grocery store which she set up in her own home.  The store is open from 6 in the morning until 8 or 9 at night.  She gets a very good income from the store.  She always tries to stock her store with what her customers need.  Many times when she leaves to buy merchandise or for another urgent matter, her daughter, Jessica, helps her with the store.  She cannot close the store because it is very busy, and that\u2019s why she has a good income.  Because of the good business, Rosa would like to expand her store by selling bookstore type of merchandise during this school season.  In the future she will have a great, well stocked store.  Rosa is the president of her community bank, Cristo Morado.  She has always well organized her group which is more like a big family than a group.  With the loan she will buy rice, sugar, 10 boxes of drinks, in addition to buying school supplies for the start of school this season.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":293626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.44,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012344,"comment":null},{"amount":133.44,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595933,"comment":null},{"amount":133.44,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990196,"comment":null},{"amount":133.44,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211321,"comment":null},{"amount":133.44,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640835,"comment":null},{"amount":132.8,"local_amount":415,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":417.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080304,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-04T12:12:53Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97556,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenia es socia del Bancomunal Amistad Unida.\nEugenia siempre le gusto trabajar, comenz\u00f3 trabajando como ambulante en el mercado, hasta que pudo comprar un puesto en el mismo mercado, y se puso a vender fruta, tambi\u00e9n ella estudio reposter\u00eda y actualmente hace postres.   \nEugenia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1600 soles, para compra de fruta al por mayor, e insumos para los postres.\nDesde que est\u00e1 en Finca, le ha ayudado a invertir, ha recibido charlas que le han orientado en el negocio, aprendi\u00f3 a ser responsable con los pr\u00e9stamos y pagar puntual.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Eugenia es poner una dulcer\u00eda en su casa.\n","en":"Eugenia is a member of the Bancomunal Amistad Unida.\r\nEugenia always liked working.
