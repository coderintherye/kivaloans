Al momento de solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo se siente motivada y apoyada porque para ella es una nueva puerta abierta.   Quiere este cr\u00e9dito para engordar sus becerros y hacer crecer su negocio, ella siempre se ha dedicado a la crianza de animales y considera ha sido muy buen negocio ya que las ganancias de unos le han dado para otros pues ha podido comprar pollos y guajolotes que la han sacado de apuros y adem\u00e1s siempre hay algo disponible para que no falte la comida en su hogar, asimismo ha comprado algunos burros que utiliza para la carga ya que sin ellos ser\u00eda un trabajo pesado. Tambi\u00e9n ha tenido la oportunidad de invertir en su casita y mejorar su calidad de vida.  Espera \tque su patrimonio siga creciendo para que llegada una edad, en la que ella y su esposo ya no puedan trabajar tengan un guardadito con el cual puedan vivir dignamente.\n\nLos otros integrantes del grupo son:\n-\tAna Rosario L\u00f3pez C.

It is located in the Felipe Coamango community, Chapa de Mota municipality, Estado de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico.    It has 10 members and this is their first loan request to CrediCom\u00fan.\r\n\r\nZenaida L. Gonz\u00e1lez, 26, is group president.  She finished 6th grade and is a housewife and a merchant.  She has 4 children.  She has sold cosmetics for the last 2 years; she also raises chickens and turkeys.  She is asking for funds to stock up on cosmetics and perfumes to sell.\r\n\r\nZenaida C. E., 47, is a group member.  She finished 6th grade, is a housewife and farmer.  She has 7 children; 3 girls and 4 boys, all of whom are married.  She has raised calves for the last 8 years.  She is asking for funds to buy feed and pasturage for the calves she already has and, once they reach proper weight, sell them and buy new ones to raise and continue with the business.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of asking for this loan, she feels motivated and supported because she\u2019s a new open door.  She wants this loan to fatten up her calves and help her business to grow.  She has always raised animals and considers this to be a profitable business because she has made profits from them that have made it possible for her to buy chickens and turkeys, which have been life savers sometimes and they have always been a sure source of nourishment for her family so that food has never been lacking.  Similarly, she has bought donkeys that she uses to transport cargo because, without them, the work would be much too heavy.  In addition, she has been able to invest in home improvements thus improving her quality of life.  She hopes that her equity will continue to grow so that someday, when she and her husband are no longer able to work, they will have a bit of savings put away to live with dignity.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\n-\tAna Rosario L\u00f3pez C.

She has recently moved in with another family member. Her family is very united, since both the mother and the children work together every day to sell their merchandise. Marcelina sells costume jewelry, and she has quite a lot of experience in this business. She has two sales locations, one by the city's post office and the other near a department of the university. Her first sales stand has very little competition, since there are only three or four stands selling jewelry. At her stand near the university, she simply has NO competition at all, since she is the only vendor. The aim of this loan is to purchase merchandise -- that is, to buy a variety of costume jewelry. Regarding her history with Agrocapital, she has had a few delays, but these have been justifiably explained by Marcelina, and now she has demonstrated punctuality in her payments with other financial

It is very close to the border with the state of Morelos.  The group is made up of 12 members, and this is the first time they are requesting a loan from Credicomun.\r\n\r\nEva S. V. is the treasurer of the group.  She is 31 years old and has only had an elementary level education.  She is a potter and has 3 children, (a 10-year old daughter, a sixteen-year old son and a 5-year old son).  She started making her living making pottery when she was 11 years old and has been doing so for 20 years; it is a family tradition.  She is requesting the loan to purchase the raw materials she uses, like mud, wood, coloring agents and other supplies.  Her dream is that her children become professionals and have a better dwelling, since a few years ago their ceiling was made of sheets of cardboard.  It is now made of concrete; thanks to the earnings from her business, they have improved it. \r\n\r\nThe names of the members of the group are: \r\n\r\nDulce Maria A.

R. is 56 years old and resides in the town of Soyapango, located in the Department of San Salvador.  She is a single person who lives with her only daughter who is working.  Rosa also lives with her three grandchildren (ages 10, 5, and 1), with the two oldest ones attending school.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa is a hardworking woman who has always struggled to get ahead.  She sells bread, cigarettes, soft drinks, candy, and other products.  Thanks to her business she has been able to move forward along with her daughter and grandchildren.  Her vending post is located outside of the largest commercial areas in Soyopango that has huge influx of people.  Since this shopping center is expanding, Rosa wants to take advantage of this opportunity by starting another food business that her daughter will be responsible for managing.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy more products such as fruit, vegetables, basic grains, bread, beverages, and other items.  This will allow her to meet the entire demand of this area, thereby generating more earnings to benefit her household.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

R. is 67 years old and lives in Ciudad Delgado in the department of San Salvador.  He lives with his 66-year-old wife, who makes a living working as a domestic servant, and their two grandchildren, who are 20 and 17 years old respectively and are in school.  Their grandchildren are completely dependent on Gustavo.  Gustavo makes a living selling medicines from his car on the streets of Soyapango.  He has made a living doing this type of work for 20 years now, and in that time he has acquired many loyal customers who wait for him whenever he passes by their homes offering his products.  Gustavo is requesting a loan so that he can increase the amount of medicines that he has on hand, which would allow him to cover new sectors of the market and have more customers, and thus increase his earnings.  Gustavo is a man who has very good references, since both he and his wife are very hard workers who have tried for years to have a decent life in which they would have everything they needed to live comfortably.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva

is a very enterprising barber, and one dedicated to providing his clients with excellent service. He began his career by working for another barber, and saved his money to go out on his own. Lazaro now has his own store and a loyal clientele base. He also rents chairs in his shop to other barbers. Lazaro is proud to create employment opportunities for others in his community.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds from Lazaro\u2019s ACCION USA loan will allow him to remodel and modernize his shop, including several \"green\" improvements. With the help and support of his parents, this Cuban-born entrepreneur is determined to continue succeeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5864.28,"image":{"id":500305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

Both have worked hard to make improvements to their home and workshop.  She is 49 years old and has three children; two are students, and one is working.  She has a number of years managing the upholstery shop.  Previously, she worked in the free trade zone where her husband worked in furniture repair.  She quit her job, and with the liquidation was able to invest in lumber to generate more income by selling chairs, sofas, and fixing furniture.  One challenge has been the high cost of lumber.  Even the covers for this work are costly, forcing her to charge higher prices and therefore lose some sales.  \r\n\r\nWith the previous loan, she managed to install a location at the front of her house where she could work under better conditions given she does not have a locale of her own.

He has always worked very hard to get his family ahead. He lives in his own home with his wife Lourdes, 39, and his minor children, who are the reason for all his work. \r\n\r\nPotato, corn and pea crops are what he does for a living. Every morning he works his land so it will be more fertile and productive. While he does this activity, his wife raises cows. They provide milk for the family and to sell. They know that they have to work in everything they can, since their children's educations require a lot of expenses. \r\n\r\nWhat Jaime likes the most about his work is protecting his crops from the pests that can plague them. He has been doing this for 23 years and he considers that the hardest part is transporting the products to market of the city of Tarma, where he sells his crops. Within a few days he hopes to harvest his products and sell them at a good price at market and thus little by little get the money together to open a grocery store in his neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nThis is the ninth loan that Jaime has had with MFP. He knows that he has to make all of his payments on time if he doesn't want to cause his communal bank problems. With the two thousand nuevos soles he is asking for he will buy new pea and potato seed, and he will also acquire fertilizer and insecticides.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":503635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase seed, fertilizer and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2051.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886862,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T07:01:27Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183635,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia tiene 53 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy sencilla que a lo largo de su vida siempre ha trabajado muy duro por sobresalir.

Many times she meets her husband, and they return to their town together.  What she likes most about her work is watering her flowers, and she does it with a lot of love.  She has been doing this for 20 years.  The most difficult part is transporting her flowers to the city of Lima because she has to do that very carefully.  In time, she wants to have a flower store in the capital.  Currently she only sells wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis is Marcelina\u2019s second loan with MFP.  She is prepared to make her payments punctually.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tempek Tengah Melaya 1 (MUK-0010).\r\n\r\nGusti Ayu is married and has one school-aged child.

In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>*****************************************************<\/b>\r\nGUSTI AYU P. MERTA (0) merupakan 42 tahun wanita. Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota MELAYA-JEMBRANA-BALI. GUSTI AYU adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 4 anggota. Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar. Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah TEMPEK TENGAH MELAYA 1 (MUK-0010).\r\n\r\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual produk makanan di tengah masyarakat setempat. GUSTI AYU sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 2 tahun. Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, GUSTI AYU menghasilkan sekitar 500,000 IDR. Dalam 2010, GUSTI AYU bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis. GUSTI AYU meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK. Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":503792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional inventory & working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gusti Ayu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jero Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":10000000,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10114500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-11T10:40:12Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183676,"name":"Aeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Aeth U. is 48 years old and a villager who lives in Trapeang Snao village in Takeo province.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Panca Kerti 1 (MUK-0008).\n\nNi Putu is widowed and has two school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 500,000 IDR a month.\n\nIn 2007, Ni Putu joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK. She is now requesting a new loan of 2,250,000 IDR which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 1st from MUK.\n\nNi Putu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\n\n\n About MUK:\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\n\n\nNote to Kiva Lenders:  \nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\n\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\n \nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click here.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":503813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9000000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":9000000,"processed_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9195000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319851,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T12:36:52Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183680,"name":"Panca Kerti 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Wayan W. is a 55 year-old female living in the town of Melaya, Jembrana, Bali.

She is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK. She is now requesting a new loan of 3,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase materials to make prayer\/worship materials. The loan will be her 1st from MUK.\n\nNi Wayan plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\n\n About MUK:\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\n\n\nNote to Kiva Lenders:  \nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\n\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\n \nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click here.\n\n\n***************************************************** \nNI WAYAN W. (0) merupakan 55 tahun wanita. Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota MELAYA-JEMBRANA-BALI. NI WAYAN adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 3 anggota. Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar. Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah PANCA KERTI 2 (MUK-0009).\n\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual bunga & persembahan nazar lainnya kepada wisatawan dan anggota masyarakat setempat. NI WAYAN sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 5 tahun. Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, NI WAYAN menghasilkan sekitar 500,000 IDR. Dalam 2007, NI WAYAN bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis. NI WAYAN meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK. Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 3,000,000 IDR.\n\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 2nd pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\n\nTentang MUK:\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\n\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\n\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":503820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase materials to make prayer\/worship materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9000000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":9000000,"processed_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9195000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319852,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T13:28:12Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183681,"name":"Rammyuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rammyuel O. is from the village of Magsaysay, Gingoog City.

O. is a 53-year-old businesswoman who has been a member of ASHI since 2004. She enjoys playing various roles being a woman. But apart from being a child who supports her parents, a supportive housewife and a loving mother to her 16-year-old child and grandmother to her six-year-old grandchild, what challenges her most is her role being a poor woman wanting to rise from poverty. Her membership in ASHI and the opportunity of getting a loan from that institution makes her feel hopeful that someday her dreams will come true.\r\n\r\nDespite her busy schedule in managing and growing her small canteen, which was put up through the loans she received from ASHI, Merlyn makes sure that she can always attend ASHI\u2019s weekly center meeting where she pays her weekly amortization, meeting her group members as well as the rest of the members of ASHI in their center. This is because Merlyn treasures the opportunity she has able to obtain because of ASHI. Now that ASHI has partnered with Kiva, Merlyn\u2019s hope of expanding her business is strengthened. She is requesting a much larger loan to grow her canteen. Through the profits of her business, she wishes to support the education of her child and grandchild who live with her, until they graduate from college.  \r\n\r\nFor a microfinance that uses Grameen methodology, ASHI being the first practitioner in the field saw how these poor women mothers work hard to earn money for the cash flow of her family and to provide her children a better life. Because micro-credit ASHI is extending to these women is delivered directly in their villages and in the doorstep of their house, together with the loan handed over to them is giving them hope that someday they will \u201crise above poverty\u201d (direct translation of Ahon Sa Hirap, in English).

(0) is a 53-year-old female living in the town of Melaya, Jembrana, Bali. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by MUK. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Temepek Tengah Melaya 2 (MUK-0011).\r\n\r\nNi Ketut is married and has four adult children. She owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 150,000 IDR a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ni Ketut joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 2,500,000 IDR which will be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell. The loan will be her first from MUK.\r\n\r\nNi Ketut plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About MUK:<\/b>\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to Kiva Lenders: <\/b> \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>*****************************************************<\/b> \r\nNI KETUT WIDIASTUTI (0) merupakan 53 tahun wanita. Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota MELAYA-JEMBRANA-BALI. NI KETUT adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 4 anggota. Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar. Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah TEMPEK TENGAH MELAYA 2 (MUK-0011).\r\n\r\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari beternak babi untuk dijual. NI KETUT sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 2 tahun. Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, NI KETUT menghasilkan sekitar 150,000 IDR. Dalam 2010, NI KETUT bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis. NI KETUT meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK. Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir.

She lives with her husband Grimaldo (65), who has been her partner all of her live, and she hopes to lead a calm life in her twilight years.\r\n\r\nThe beauty salon that with so much effort she started as a young woman has provided her with the necessary income to support her family. Now her business has grown a lot and has become one of the most important salons in the city. They have many loyal clients who visit the salon for their hair cuts and styling.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is taking care of her clients with care and professionalism. She has worked in this business for 30 years and she thinks the most difficult part is dealing with the chemical smell of the hair dyes, which sometimes make her dizzy. In the future she hopes to turn her beauty salon into a spa where she could offer a broader range of services to her clients.\r\n\r\nThis will be Maria's first loan with MFP. She understands that she has to make her payments on time if she wants to receive another loan in the future. With the 2,000 new soles from the loan she will buy beauty products for the salon.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva

He is married with five children, four of whom are working in Spain. They made this decision due to the situation at home when they left.  \r\n\r\nHe works making and repairing chairs from iron pipe and cable. He started this business when his children left the country. At first, he went from house to house repairing chairs and later as the business grew clients asked him to make chairs and placed orders. He has been making his own chairs for one year and his five grandchildren work with him making and selling sets of chairs. Since Osvaldo did not have enough money to buy the machine that bent the iron pipes he built a homemade device that does the bending.\r\n\r\nToday thanks to the Fundacion Paraguaya and the loan he received Osvalda has been able to purchase the machine to bend iron pipes. This makes it easier and faster to make the chairs that he sells.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":504149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase of machinery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Asunci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-03-11T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Osvaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5344736,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":386106},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":396067},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":406286},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":416768},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":427521},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":438551},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":449865},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":461472},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":473378},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":485591},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":498119},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":505012}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.22},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.41},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.79},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.29},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.86},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.48},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.18},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.08,"local_amount":386106,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":390417.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128951453,"comment":null},{"amount":85.22,"local_amount":396067,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":400489.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714453,"comment":null},{"amount":87.41,"local_amount":406286,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":410822.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151897971,"comment":null},{"amount":89.68,"local_amount":416768,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":421421.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638251,"comment":null},{"amount":91.99,"local_amount":427521,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":432294.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852313,"comment":null},{"amount":94.36,"local_amount":438551,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":443447.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172119109,"comment":null},{"amount":96.79,"local_amount":449865,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":454888.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413126,"comment":null},{"amount":521.47,"local_amount":2423572,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2450633.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182552807,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-14T13:38:07Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183804,"name":"Vicsia Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El  se\u00f1ora Vicsia Maria posee un negocio de venta de comida, desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, la se\u00f1ora trabaja junto a su marido, la se\u00f1ora realiza sus compras en Le\u00f3n y en Managua de contado pues le resulta mucho m\u00e1s favorable ya que es as\u00ed le resulta mucho m\u00e1s favorable obtener cada uno de los productos que solicita.

The group is located in the Eben Ezer neighborhood of the city of Danli.  Here\u00b4s a description of the members\u00b4 businesses:\r\n\r\nSr. Manuel de Jesus R. C. operates a business making and selling sweets.  The business is called Dulces R.--nice play on Manuel\u00b4s name--and specializes in sweets made with bananas.  Manuel has operated the business for four years.  His customers come day after day to buy from him and he can\u00b4t always meet demand because he doesn\u00b4t have enough capital to buy the ingredients he needs for his sweets.  His products are popular because they\u00b4re delicious--\u00a8R.\u00a8--and priced right.  Manuel is married and his wife helps him with the business because demand is so great.  The couple has 2 children who also help with the business.\r\n\r\nSra. Arsenia A. has operated a business making and selling corn tortillas for more than six years.  She operates the business at home. She has won over her customers with big portions and the cleanliness of her kitchen.  Her customers are drawn from the Col. Eben Ezer and Col Bella Vista neighborhoods.  She makes the tortillas and sells some of them from her house and others from a corner shop.  Still others are delivered to regular customers.  Arsenia is married.  Her husband is also an entrepreneur, traveling around the \u00a8departamento\u00a8 of El Paraiso, selling a wide range of goods.  The couple has three children and they are 100% responsible for providing them with food, schooling, etc.\r\n\r\nSra. Gloria Marina F. Ordonez has operated a business making and selling donuts for about a year.  Gloria makes the donuts at home and sells them at two tobacco factories that are near her house, the factories\u00b4 employees being her target customers.  Gloria makes 100 donuts a day.  She sells them all but she can\u00b4t make more because she doesn\u00b4t have the capital to do so.  She would like to expand so everyone who wants her delicious donuts can buy them.  She tells us that her customers often ask for Osmil or juices but she can\u00b4t supply them because she doesn\u00b4t have enough money to invest in thermos bottles and ice to provide beverages to her customers.  Gloria is the single mother of three children.  Her former partner provides her with some support for food but it\u00b4s not enough to cover all the household\u00b4s expenses.  She started the business to cover the difference and it\u00b4s gone well so far.

He lives in a rented house with his 26 year old wife, Mariluz, and their beloved son who is 5 years old and who is the motive for all their efforts. <p>\r\nWith the help of his wife, he has worked his land until it is very fertile and productive. Every day they work side by side to ensure that their crops keep improving. After the harvest, they sell their produce in the main market of the city of Tarma, where they generally get good prices. <p>\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is cultivating his peas, potatoes, and corn. He has been doing this for 10 years and he thinks the most difficult thing about it is transporting his produce to the market. <p>\r\nIn time, he hopes to have a small stall at the market where his wife can sell their produce, as he believes they loose much of their potential profit by selling wholesale to other vendors. <p>\r\nThis is the seventh loan that Wellinton has had from MFP. He has been very punctual in repaying his earlier loans, and hopes to do the same this time as well. He is a very responsible member of his community bank, and is always aware of the agreements they have reached as a group.

He lives in the house he inherited from his parents five years ago.  Wilker is inclined to work hard so that he can improve his quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he was much younger, he knew he had to focus all of his efforts to making a life for himself through his work.  Wilker grows potatoes, corn, carrots and peas.  These crops are approaching the harvest season and he will sell them at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  His customers are aware of the quality of his crops, so they buy them quickly.  What he enjoys most about his job is protecting his crops from pestilence.  Wilker has been farming for four years and considers the most difficult part to be hauling his produce to the market where he sells because the sacks of produce are very heavy.

The oldest is 16 years old and works as a helper with his father; he is also finishing secondary school because he had dropped out of school but is now back attempting to finish his studies (he is in an open studies program).  The other five children are between 14 and 4 years of age; they are all students except the youngest, who stays home with his mother.  They live in a rented house in the Trinidad neighborhood, Turi parish.  This parish is known for being a tourist attraction because one can get a panoramic view of most of Cuenca from there.  Most of the residents are farmers and the young residents work in the city.\r\n\r\nMaria works as a domestic caring for other people\u2019s houses.  She has been in this line of work for several years but she only works part-time, four days a week; the rest of the time she spends with her family, she farms vegetables and she raises chickens for subsequent sale in Cuenca\u2019s free market.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan cycle.  Previous loans have made it possible for her to maintain her chicken hatchery and to buy feed for her chicks.  The new loan from FUNDACI\u00d3N ESPOIR will be used to buy chickens, corn and vitamins to enlarge her business.\r\n\r\nBecause she enjoys everything that has to do with cooking, her hope for the future is to have a small food stand to sell her delicious dishes. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She has worked as a teacher in the Cesar Augusto Salinas Pinell de Nueva Guinea School for 32 years. She is known as a responsible and very hardworking woman.

He lives in a house through an \u201canticretico\u201d arrangement (in which the property owner pawns the house to the occupant).  Gerson is married and has two young children.  He works in the transportation sector, but also has a second job in construction since his transport business is not stable.  His wife Sra. Magdalena looks after their children so that he can work in the early hours until late into the night to support their family.  \n\nGerson is a responsible, dynamic, and hardworking person who puts in tremendous effort to improve the quality of life for his family.  He will use this loan to repair and perform maintenance on his vehicle in order to offer better service to his clients.  He is grateful to Emprender and Kiva for their trust by providing this loan.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the province of El Torno or La Guardia visit the website:

Mrs. Gloria Delfina is the mother of a family.  Her husband went abroad to work and from time to time sends supplies for their children.  She is the mother of two school-aged children and thus she has to work all day in the stand selling slippers, sandals, and rubber shoes to get some income for their books and school supplies.  The money that her husband sends is only  enough to pay the rent of their house and for  small savings to be used to buy a piece of land.  This will give them a more comfortable living situation and a better future for their children.  The loan is for the purchase of merchandise from wholesale distributors.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of the members work in selling handicrafts, tailoring, cleaning supplies and selling food.  There is a lot of competition in the market but they are valued for the speed they have to change and proviD. merchandise appropriate to the season and the demands of the market.

Junio\" (June 5) is represented by Ximena Antonia and consists of 12 members, all women, who are very hardworking and capable of maintaining their households, as Se\u00f1ora Ximena Antonia demonstrates. She is the single mother of a young child and knows how to work to advance her  family, which consists of her mother, who is already a woman of age, and then her son. She works in the production and sale of denim and leather jackets. She lives in a zone some distance from the center, and for this reason she must leave her little son in the hands of her mother to be able to go to work early in the morning. Her greatest wish is to be able to have her own factory for making jackets, and she knows that she will be able to achieve this with effort and work. The loan is destined for the purchase of basic materials so that she can be independent and be able to do some work in her home, where she can care for her son and her mother.\r\n<p>\r\nThe rest of the group works in different business activities such as grocery sales in shops in the neighborhood, sales of books and school supplies, backpacks, clothing, blankets, and vegetables, and making articles of clothing. The loans are destined for the purchase of basic materials such as fabrics, threads, seasonal merchandise, and tools to do better work, which can be translated into a better income for the sustenance of their homes.\r\n<p>\r\nAs for experience, the members are familiar with how community banks work thanks to loans from institutions like Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital, which offers them economic support so that they continue growing.

This community bank is characterized by being very united and happy. Se\u00f1ora Mery Martha is the president and sells groceries in a shop in the market. She is married, and she and her husband, Juan, have three children of school age. Her husband works in metal finishing and has his own shop in their home in the city of El Alto in order to maintain their family. They live in a little house that belongs to their parents. The expectations of Se\u00f1ora Mery Martha and her husband are to grow little by little and be able to buy themselves a piece of land of their own and become independent to give greater comfort to their children.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group works in different activities, the majority in clothing sales, either as traveling vendors or at fixed shops. Some members have a little internet cafe, others sell food, others sell blankets, have a photocopying service, or work in public transport. \r\n\r\nThe group in general has sufficient experience in the businesses they operate, and it's for this reason that they are known in the markets where they sell their products, and thus competition does not affect them too much. The present loan will be used as operating capital for the purchase of merchandise, ingredients, and materials to improve their businesses and give their families a better quality of life. The expectation of the group is to continue working and counting, above all, on the confidence and economic support of Agrocapital to be able to reach their goals, since they are in their fifth loan

In the photograph, he is standing on the left in the second row and wearing a blue pullover.  Jorge sells clothing and kitchen towels.  His loan will be invested in winter clothing such as undershirts, thermal underwear, long socks, and other items.  Jorge has been working with Fondo Esperanza for seven months and says it has been a great help.  He is a student, so this will help him pay for minor expenses as well as help his parents with their expenses.  Jorge will receive his degree in social work this month and intends to continue working with Fondo Esperanza.  His goal is to have more customers so that he can open a store in the central part of town.\r\n\r\nCuric\u00f3 is located in the region of Maule, which is in the central part of the country.  The climate in Curic\u00f3 is similar to that of the Mediterranean and considered one of the nicest in the country.  It is also known for its wine culture and the magical natural beauty of the surrounding areas.  Even though the workforce has increased, the region has remained steady in its population since the last census because it is one of the poorest in the country.  This area experienced damage from the recent earthquake in Chile, but the Communal Bank did not suffer from any serious effects.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

P. is an embroiderer. She learned the craft from her mother starting when she was 14 years old. With her embroidery work, she was able to pay her way through school and received a license to teach primary school. She is married and has a three-year-old son. In addition to embroidery, she also started selling chickens that she butchers herself. She gets up at 4:30 in the morning to butcher the chickens, and someone else helps her sell them, since she goes off to work as a teacher in the mornings and in the afternoons works at her embroidery.\r\n\r\nShe's a young, enterprising woman with many dreams for her little son. She's been a member of the Banco de Confianza for three years, but now she needs more funds in order to keep working. She reports that the village bank has helped her a lot and been a great support for her family. Her dream for the future -- as well as a challenge -- is to open an Internet caf\u00e9 in her home, since it's near the local school and they don't already have this service locally.

He has been able to improve his business through Faulu Kenya. This is because he was previously hawking radio cassettes and videotapes. He has requested for a loan of KES 80,000 to add stock of tyres, windscreens, suspension and paint.  He hopes to get a better market for his products and to open a music shop.
