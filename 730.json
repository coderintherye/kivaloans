She is married to a businessman, and has 2 children, aged 20 and 6 years, who go to school.  She has 1 additional dependent - a niece, who lives with her so she can attend a good school in town.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Rugiatu established her retail business selling jeans, baby wrappers, blankets, blouse, nickers, and jewelry.  When her mother died, Rugiatu was a child and her father could not take good care of her, so she had to live with his father's closest friend.  She could not attend school because her caretaker did not think it appropriate.  Several years later, the caretaker died and Rugiatu had to live with her older brother.  They could barely afford to feed her, let alone pay for her schooling.  So Rugiatu started trading in order to help with the household expenses.  Ever since then, business is all she knows.  <p>\r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,798,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan of Le 4,500,000.  Rugiatu has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase ladies sandals - 3 cartons @ Le500,000, ladies jeans 60 pieces @ Le15,000, tights for ladies 120 pieces @ Le15,000, the balance Le300,000 as transportation.  She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 270,000. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rugiatu plans to build a house with a shop and is nervous about the future because she has a lot to do, to achieve her dreams.  She wants her children to be educated.  The loan will help as she will generate more income to run her business.  Her major challenge is the rainy season.  Though she sells in a secure stall that protects from the rain, she has fewer customers and therefore less profit during this season.  Competition is high but she offers affordable prices, latest designs and quality goods.  She serves about 15 customers per day, all ladies in the city and nearby villages .   She uses public transport to buy her goods in Guinea-Conakry twice a month.  She has been reinvesting her profits into her business.   Rugiatu always pays on time and will continue to do so since the access to more loans is her only source of generating income.  She is hard working and honest and thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":393.75,"image":{"id":934279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase inventory for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T17:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rugiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":562500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721838,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124756,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505662,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T00:43:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":365832,"name":"Musonyole Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nganasa is the facilitator of the Musonyole group.

She is married to a trader, and has 6 children aged 25, 20, 19, 17, 15 and10 years.  Three are all school going children. \r\n\r\nIn 1997, Memunatu established her groundnut and onions business. She began her business because she was living with her uncle, who intended to see her through school, but his wife refused to allow that and suggested instead that Mumunatu join the business.  Memunatu's parents were poor and could not help her, so they had no alternative but to agree with the aunt since Memunatu was living with the aunt and uncle.  Memunatu was introduced to the business at a young age and now she can boast of being a very good business woman. <p> \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,564,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan of Le 4,000,000. Memunatu has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy groundnuts - 8 bags @ Le450,000 and onions 5 bags @ Le80,000.  She hopes that this loan will help increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 385,000. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Memunatu plans to build a house.  She wants to educate her children because she herself was deprived from it.  A part of the profit will be reinvested in her business and the rest will be saved for her children's education.

women's leggings and stockings.  She has three adult children - one daughter and two sons, all of whom already have their own families.  Mavchuda has been divorced from her husband for a long time.  Her oldest son works in the Russian Federation as a construction worker and sends money to his mother every month to cover family expenses.

Citizens from all corners of Ecuador live in this area, making it diverse and entrepreneurial, and this is precisely its identity. It is located in a rainy, subtropical climate zone, with an average temperature of 22.9\u00b0C.

The most important activity is cattle ranching, since the largest cattle market in Ecuador is here. Since it is located in a tropical area and limited by a branch of the Andes mountain range, there is a high degree of biodiversity and ecological zones that create an infinite variety of ecosystems.\r\n\r\nEnma sells cleaning products in order to be able to contribute to the household finances.

is a 55-year-old mother with 4 children.\n\nMalama owns and operates a business venture,selling pancakes in her village.  She has two years of experience in this business. Malama needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase goods such as , flour,sugar , vegetable oil and pots.She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 35 Talas or US $15 per week) to supplement her family's income.\n\nIn 2010, Malama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Malama's second loan with SPBD. \n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is a 21-year-old woman.  She lives in the town of Samata I Uta.  She is single and has no children.  To make a living, Fuamata owns and operates a business venture.  The business operates in the services sector.  The main purpose of the business is operating a tailoring business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alterations and tailoring services to local community members.  Fuamata has been engaged in this business for over three years.  From these activities, Fuamata earns approximately 1000 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fuamata joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fuamata is requesting a loan from SPBD for the second time.  Her previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  She is now requesting a new loan of 1350 WST.  The current loan will be used to purchase a new sewing machine.  Fuamata plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to make improvements to her

She owns & operates a business venture selling baked goods in the local community.  She has 4 years of experience in this business.  She needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make the products she sells.  She plans to use the profits from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Uini joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Uini's 1st loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is 36 years of age, married, and has 4 children.  She owns & operates a business venture planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.  She needs a loan of WST $2000.00 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profits from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faifau joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Faifua's 5th loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aotoa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Because they lack collateral, most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks. This is Aotoa's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is Haide, 35, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Glenn, a businessman. She is the mother of three children; all of them are still studying in elementary school. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college, which is a dream for most Filipino parents like Haide as she herself is a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nHaide operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats, braided quilts and bed sheets, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 215 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread, and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHaide dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fetu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Fetu's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.25,"image":{"id":934909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Tuavao's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Thanks to her persistence and hard work, she was able to develop her business which now has a monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS) and working assets of 80,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Tursunay turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to widen her assortment of goods.  Tursunay plans to invest the income from her loan in enlarging her sales stall and, in the future, to begin breeding cattle as well."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":934946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to broaden her assortment of goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bazarkorgon village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-05T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tursunay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T04:18:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366121,"name":"Exaltacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Exaltacion, 62, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines.

She mainly offers rugs from those round palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney (a small bus) down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nExaltacion dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":237.5,"image":{"id":934951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":" to pay for raw materials like fabric and thread needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-03T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Exaltacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.96,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4319.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738840,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":3332.97,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3455.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146072,"comment":null},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2591.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275207,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-03T16:51:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366122,"name":"Romeo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Romeo is 30 years old and is a married man with 3 children.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is), and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Maliana's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 45 years old and married with eight children.\r\n\r\nRasela owns and operates a business selling fried foods in the local community. She has one year of experience in this business. Rasela needs a loan of WST 1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Rasela joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Rasela's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.25,"image":{"id":934973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or $83 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sosefina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Sosefina's fourth loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 37 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nMilly owns and operates a business selling ice-cake. She has many years of experience in this business. Milly needs a loan of WST 2,500 to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 220 talas or US $92 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Milly joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Milly's fourth loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is Nerissa, 47, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Ulysses, a local Official, and is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNerissa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighbourhood customers. It is the place to go to buy a container of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Nerissa earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nNerissa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to send her children to college. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":622.92,"image":{"id":934985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"

is 46 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nAtinae owns and operates a business planting and harvesting bananas for sale. She has years of experience in this business. Atinae needs a loan of WST 1,000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or $108 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Atinae joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Atinae's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.42,"image":{"id":934986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is 55 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nSalote owns and operates a business venture selling pancakes. She has two years of experience in this business. Salote needs a loan of WST 1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 240 talas or $100 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Salote joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Salote's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is 21 years old and married, with one child.\r\n\r\nMarie owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business. Marie needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Marie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Marie's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.42,"image":{"id":934993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is 25 years of age and married, with three children.  Jacinta owns and operates a business venture, selling porkbun.  She has two years of experience in this business.  Jacinta needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase flour, plastic bags, cooking oil, and a frying pan.  She plans to use the profits from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Jacinta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Jacinta's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.42,"image":{"id":934995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 2000 talas or US $833 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Falute joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Falute's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 32 years old and married with 2 children.\r\n\r\nLolua owns & operates a business venture, selling banana chips.  She has many years of experience in this business. Lolua needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lolua  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lolua 's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Luafulufa needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nLuafulufa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Luafulufa 's third loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\n\nWith income from maize sales, Sarah will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\n\nIn 2012, the members of Utamaduni group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":935052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorcas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Festus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rasoa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":81200,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
