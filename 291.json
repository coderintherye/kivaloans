What Elena wants most of all is to give her three children (Br\u00edgida, 7, Renzo, 5 and Yakelin, 2) the opportunity  to study so that in the future they can manage on their own.\r\n\r\nThe 11 years that Elena has been raising cattle has allowed her to carve out a dignified life for herself. She has been raising cattle since she was 15 years old and she has converted herself in one of the most sought after cattle farmers to date, due to the strong animals that she sells in the city of Juliaca.\r\n\r\nWhat Elena likes most of all about her job is raising her animals, as she now knows that the better she cares for them, the more money she will earn from them.

P. is from the village of Cabilinan, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 38 years old. Josephine is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" (variety) retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josephine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and to save for the future.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":408177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Mary Jane is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Mary Jane from GDMPC.

P. is from the city of Tinago Ozamiz. She is 46 years old, married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Milagrosa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized \"mangga\" retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling mango fruits in the local community. Milagrosa has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Milagrosa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and strengthen her business. Milagrosa is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Milagrosa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She also has the company of her husband (Amilcar), 50, in a cozy house in a quiet suburb north of Lima.  Two years ago she discovered that the sale of lingerie for women is very profitable, given that these items are always necessary and many people look to buy good quality undergarments at a low price.  Ever since that time she has been engaged in this business.  Many times she takes orders, but other times she just buys merchandise to her liking and later sells it to friends and neighbors.  Leycith likes to sell lingerie because she can identify with the products, since she is a woman and knows what women need.  She also works preparing food in a popular eatery in her district, since through this activity she can save to pay for household expenses.  In the future she would like to have a lingerie shop in a busy market area located close to her home.  This is her third loan from MFP, and she is committed to be punctual, as always, in her payments.  In addition she gets along well with all of the members of her communal bank because they are friends of hers that she knows well.  Leycith is going to invest the money that she is requesting in merchandise so that she can build up her capital and in this way acquire a stall in the market.\r\n  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":409026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T00:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leycith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843045,"comment":null},{"amount":137.87,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":392.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734621,"comment":null},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959704,"comment":null},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992551,"comment":null},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717337,"comment":null},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751143,"comment":null},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":192.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933711,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-24T13:11:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":145282,"name":"Dolores","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dolores is from the village of Parog-Parog, Solana,Cagayan.

Her husband, Oscar, also cheerfully helps with the work.\r\n<p>\r\nThe hardest time, according to her means \u201crun around more,\u201d is midday, since she has to attend to her customers on their lunch hour and also to her family. Mery attends the store almost the entire day and on weekends the hours can extend until midnight.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she thinks she will update the facilities in her business, stock it with more merchandise and eventually sell food from outside her home.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has already had 4 loans with MFP, and she has always liked collaborating with her communal bank, but for matters of time, she is requesting an individual loan this time. Half of the money that she requests will be used to purchase more merchandise, while the other half will be used to update her shop in order to have a good appearance for her customers.    \r\n<br

This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nSonia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC.

Pamandayan, Brgy. Buenavista, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She is 48 years old and is married to Simplicio S., who works as a laborer on one of the haciendas (sugar plantations) in their locality. To earn additional income for the family, he also plants sugar cane on a small parcel of land that the couple owns. The couple has 6 children between the ages of 13 and 28 years old. Consolacion hopes to provide her children with good education so that they can have great jobs in the future.\r\n\r\nSince she takes care of the family's finances, Consolacion knew for a fact that even if her husband worked twice as hard, his income would still not be enough to support their family, much less provide their children the future to which they aspired. To address this dilemma, Consolacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in January 1996 and used her loan of PHP 2,000 to start a retail business selling bananas. She reinvested  the income to buy more bananas to sell. As time went on, and her income improved and she was also able to borrow larger amounts.\r\n\r\nLater, Consolacion started a business selling bingka (coconut and rice cakes) in their community. Then she diversified into charcoal sales, increasing her income potential even further. She also used the income to continue expanding her businesses and cultivating the family's sugar cane farm. All of these activities earn her a cumulative monthly income of PHP 10,000, which they use for their children's education and to support their businesses.\r\n\r\nBecause Consolacion has been a member with a good credit track record, she was able to borrow PHP 16,000 for her previous loan, which she used to add to her working capital her businesses and their sugarcane farm. Now that she has repaid the loan, she is again borrowing PHP 16,000. She plans to use the loan funds as additional capital for her business, to buy fertilizer, and to cultivate their sugar cane farm.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Consolacion is shown in her sugar cane farm when the fields have recently been harvested and must be readied for planting.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Yin P. is a villager in Damnak Roveang village in Takeo province. She is a sand seller. Her husband, Mr. Au Sorn, is a farmer who owns a piece of land to cultivate both rice and vegetables.

Mao C. is single and lives in Svay Thom village in Takeo province.

She is now applying for a new loan in the amount of P 10,000.00 so that she can have enough funds to restock on grocery items she also sells at her store.\r\n\r\nLoryn wishes to have other store outlets in other parts of the town.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT:\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is a Christian organization dedicated to fighting poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical missions in a uniquely Filipino context.

John Bosco is the leader of his lending group in Ibanda. He is a very hardworking and friendly man. He is 38 years old and married with 2 children, both of whom are in primary school; he also takes care of 2 dependants. He has had a retail shop in the Nyarukika trading centre for 15 years, where he is able to make 120,000 as profits a week.

He is 35 years old, married, and the father of 3 children with ages between 1 and 7 years old.  The oldest is in school.  Besides them he is not responsible for anyone else and is able to save 1,500MT each month.  He counts on the help of an employee and pays him 1,000MT monthly.\r\n\r\nTomas left Inhambane when he was 10 years old with his uncle to Swaziland where he went to school through the 8th grade.  He had to interrupt his schooling after the death of his uncle.  As such he was able to arrange a job in the mines of South Africa where he worked on a contract for 5 years.  At the end of the contract he was compensated 80,000MT and consecutively he returned to Mozambique to set up his residence in Namaacha on the border of Swaziland.  He acquired a wagon to help him with his daily work.\r\n\r\nToday he is a traveling vendor (sells from his car).  For more than 5 years he has sold at the informal market two times week (Wednesday and Saturday) from 7:00am until 5:00pm.  His best products are (corn flour, fruit, Omo, and vegetable oil) which he acquires in neighboring Swaziland.  He purchases his goods for 20,000MT per visit, and he earns 5,500MT per month.\r\n\r\nHe approached Hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to purchase more products and satisfy the demand of his customers.  This is Tomas' first loan through Hluvuku and Kiva for 15,000MT which will be used to purchase more products.

With the help of a neighboor, who raised chicken, she started doing it herself and saw her chick raising business grow. \r\n\r\nThis is Celeste's third loan in the amount of 25.000,00MT (U$875) which she'll use to buy more chicks and improve her business. She hopes to pay it in no time so she can ask for another loan in order to buy a pickup van to help with her daily work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She is 43 years old and lives with her husband and six children with ages between 11 and 30. Five of them go to school, and the older one is employed. Besides her children, she also suports her five grandchildren. They all live in her house.\r\n\r\nJoana got pregnant when she was in 7th grade, and her parents threw her out of the house. She couldn't continue her studies because she had to start working with her husband in the farms. Her husband has had other 4 wives and a total of 74 children, so Joana has to work hard to support herself and her children. She's been in this business for the past 25 years, and she has no employees, but counts with the help of children and sons-in-law. Her best selling product is corn. Her husband is now in the hospital and she has several medical bills to pay.\r\n\r\nShe's asking for a 25.000,00MT (U$875) loan in order to invest in her business and make more money in the near future. She'll use the loan to work the land and buy seeds and fertilizers. She's positive she'll be able to pay the loan back on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":852.56,"image":{"id":409278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of agricultural products and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-10-26T23:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.44,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1252.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1288.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1325.47},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1363.6},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1402.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1443.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1484.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1527.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1571.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1616.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1663.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1710.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1760.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1810.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1862.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.46},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.75,"local_amount":2164.38,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816827,"comment":null},{"amount":64.51,"local_amount":1843.09,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709010,"comment":null},{"amount":134.08,"local_amount":3830.88,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3834.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938090,"comment":null},{"amount":70.79,"local_amount":2022.65,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-20T08:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938091,"comment":null},{"amount":70.95,"local_amount":2079.13,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-16T08:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2081.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.82,"payment_id":128972004,"comment":null},{"amount":74.79,"local_amount":2136.83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2138.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698598,"comment":null},{"amount":74.83,"local_amount":2164.82,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.94,"payment_id":151916032,"comment":null},{"amount":147.55,"local_amount":4569.42,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4573.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.38,"payment_id":159878473,"comment":null},{"amount":139.31,"local_amount":4188.8,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4193,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.3,"payment_id":177431763,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T05:23:19Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":145436,"name":"Esohe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esohe sells provisions, drinks, beef and foodstuffs.

vegetables, fresh meat and fish for two years.  Because electronic load credit for mobile phones is in demand, she also tried it and proved it to be a worthwhile additional source of income. Zenaida now earns a net income of PHP 16,000 per month. From her profits, she was able to purchase a motorcycle.\r\n\r\nShe is now on her seventh loan cycle with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  She joined the cooperative in 2007. Zenaida has applied for a new loan in the amount of PHP 19,000 as additional capital for her food market business.\r\n\r\nZenaida desires to have her own public market someday. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n

The loans from the cooperative provide stability for her business. She can now purchase rice in advance from a government operated warehouse at a lower cost.

She hired a niece to assist them in attending to customers. The combined operations of their grocery outlets give them a monthly net income of 44,000 PHP.

She has just finished repaying her previous loan with the cooperative, so she has applied for a new loan in the amount of 49,000 PHP to purchase more grocery items for both stores. This is her eighth loan with the cooperative.\r\n\r\nAnita believes that education is the most precious gift she can give to her child, so she and her husband work hard hand-in-hand to be able to send their child to school up to college.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

Lozio is a friendly, hard working and determined married man and the leader of his lending group in Lugazi. He is a businessman in the tailoring trade. He has been in this business for 10 years. One of the major challenges in his business is the seasonality of his business, leading to the scarcity of customers yet the needs keep coming in. Lozio makes 250,000\/= profit a week and this helps him pay school fees and cater to other family needs in time. Because Lozio is able to have quality materials for his business, he has been able to acquire tenders like making uniforms for schools and for other functions. He wishes to expand his business further and, if possible, start a tailoring school and teach more people the same trade. Lozio needs a loan to help buy more material to make new clothes.

Difficulties arise when she loses money because customers do not pay.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she started working with communal banks, Candida wanted to open her own shop so that she could generate a better income.  With this loan, she will buy cosmetics and perfumes so that she can offer her customers a wider variety.  One of her goals is to begin home improvements.  She is satisfied with the financing the Institution has provided.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Jim\u00e9nez is 39 years old, is married, and has three young children. Two of her children are in primary school, and her husband works as a microbus driver. Maria has a business located next to the market where she sells cheese and fruits. She has sold cheese for more than 8 years, but it was not until 2 years ago that she decided to invest in the purchase of fruit and vegetables to sell in her space. She did this hoping to increase her income. She started this business with her husband's cousin, who invested capital. The loan will be invested in the purchase of more produce which will allow her to increase sales and thus her profits. Lately they have had problems because of the price instability of the products, and the financing will help handle those problems. Her dream has always been to grow her business in order to offer a better quality of life for her children.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":409624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of produce and dairy products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T14:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":857.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":884.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948705,"comment":null},{"amount":42.85,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":884.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790851,"comment":null},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":884.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681346,"comment":null},{"amount":47.75,"local_amount":955.08,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":985.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075874,"comment":null},{"amount":37.97,"local_amount":759.2,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":783.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911883,"comment":null},{"amount":42.85,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":884.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947736,"comment":null},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":857.16,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":884.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676002,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T15:48:36Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":145597,"name":"Saly Seydou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Saly Seydou S., 51 ans, mari\u00e9e, avec 5 enfants en charge dont 2 qui vont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole est membre du Banc Villageois de TENGHORY DIAMALAYE depuis 7 ans.

Over time, she learned a lot about the fashion industry and founded \u201cApocalypse Vintage\u201d in Portland, Oregon, two years ago. She began selling vintage clothing online and to local thrift stores and eventually employed a staff of seven people. For Alix, her company and vintage clothing represent a way for people to express their unique style and have a positive body image.\r\n\r\nWhen the economy slowed down last year, Alix made the decision to downsize and move her business down to San Francisco, to take advantage of the more vibrant fashion industry in the Bay Area. With a $10,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, she recently signed a lease for a 9,000 square foot warehouse that will not only house her clothing inventory but also have space for fashion shows and photo shoots.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Alix hopes to sub-lease warehouse space out to other artists and develop a print production company. Asked where her business would be without Opportunity Fund, Alix is honest \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think I would have had to grow much slower and put my dreams on hold.\u201d\r\n\r\nVisit:

Happily, he does it with dedication and that causes his customers to leave his shop happy which, in turn, leaves him with good profits.  For the future he would like to have another, equally profitable business; he has thought of opening a hardware store so as to have a family business.

D.

The two older sons attained only a high school education, but Alvin got a two-year course in college with the help of his brother, Reynaldo, who is now working as an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker).\r\n<p>\r\nThe main source of their family income is their rug-making business which they have been involved in for twelve years. The rugs are made by sewing together pieces of fabric remnants to create both small and big rugs. According to Rustica, this business gives them enough income for their expenses because they persevere in making rugs everyday. \r\n<p>\r\nKiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) contributes a lot to why their business is now doing well. This institution helps them make their life much more comfortable than before.  Now, requesting her fourth loan from ASHI, Rustica wants to use the loan to make their business grow more. If ever her business gives them more profit, she wants to save for the future of her family, especially her grandchildren. Rustica  wants them to complete their studies through college. This is one of her life's

She is married to Reynante E., who works as a barber in their town. They have two children: Gracian Dave, who is in second grade and Geremy, now in first grade. They have more expenses than before because of their children's schooling, so Mary Grace wants to help her husband provide for their needs. She wants her children to go to college so they can have a better life in the future.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary Grace joined the Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), in 2002, her business was already in operation. She sells a variety of beauty products, ready-to-wear clothes, shoes and a selection of bags. Recently she used a loan that she received from them to expand her business. Now, requesting her twelfth loan, Mary Grace will use the additional capital to improve her business by offering more things for sale so that she can gain more profit. Through the years this business has been a big help to their family. Her income, added to the income of her husband from being a barber, contributes to the family in many ways. \r\n<p>\r\nThey have another business, which is raising different animals that they can sell, especially if there is some occasion. These profits also contribute to their daily expenses, so Mary Grace will use some amount of her loan to buy animals to raise, like chickens.\r\n\r\nAside from her dream that her children finish their studies, Mary Grace also wants to save for the renovation of their house to a much more comfortable and sturdier one. Of course it is because she wants her family to experience a better life that she works so hard."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":409766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"As

His business has expanded greatly thanks to his efforts and he was recently able to purchase a larger refrigerator.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, moreover, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since sheep raising and selling is a profitable business, Abdusator has become a very successful businessman in a very short period. He works very hard and spends all his time with his animals, cleaning them, feeding them, and pasturing them. Now Abdusator wants to expand his business and buy more sheep.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. Additionally, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. Additionally, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. Additionally, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is an energetic 20-year-old.

With much effort he initiated his own business with very little merchandise. Selling soft drinks and juices, little by little he was able to maintain his home and start to grow his business, incorporating the sale of grocery items too and improving the quality of service he offered. <P>\r\n\r\nSherzod needs a loan of 5000 Somoni, which he will use to provide more juices and soft drinks so he can continue to work hard to sustain his family. Sherzod very much appreciates your support.  <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
