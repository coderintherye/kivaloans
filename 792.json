When she took her first steps in business, she focused on selling underwear.  She was studying at the time and it was easier for her to do this.  When she got married in 1980 her husband, who had a lot of experience (because he used to work in a store,) shared his knowledge with her and encouraged her to start her own business.  She gradually bought sheets and toiletries which she sold to her first customers who were neighbors.  She did very well.  With her savings, she acquired display cabinets one by one and started to diversify her product range until she turned the business into what it is today a 'general store' where, in addition to a variety of merchandise, she also sells food, provisions, soft drinks, etc.  Right now, her wish is to continue growing her business and this is why she has requested a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy school supplies and food products in larger quantities, making the most of the fact that it is the first school term of the year which is a good time to sell these products.  Traditionally she has done very well at this.  Cecilia's goal is to continue growing her business and to promote it further with adverts via the latest technology.  With this business and both Cecilia and her husband's work, they have managed to support their two children who are now 27 and 28 years old."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1008202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy school supplies and food products in larger quantities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":1750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3100000,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":133319},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143663},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":147016},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150446},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":153956},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":157549},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":161225},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":164987},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":168836},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":172776},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":176807},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":180933},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":185155},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":189475},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":193896},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":198420},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":203050},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":218491}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T02:04:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396478,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 -

Together with her husband, she started to grow vegetables 20 years ago.  At first, they planted tomatoes, radishes and other vegetables in the open ground.  Then, they started to cover the ground with plastic by building small greenhouses.  Due to the changes in prices and seasons (early vegetables are more profitable to sell), they now have the need to build a large greenhouse, but do not have their own means to do so.

Two years ago her father began an internet caf\u00e9 business which he later gave to her so that she could earn her own income, pay for her university education, and become more independent.

He is married and has two children.  Previously, he used to go to the Russian Federation and work there, but due to unknown circumstances, he was no longer able to work there.  At home, his family kept livestock and grew various agricultural crops from spring to autumn.  He also stopped going to Russia and began helping them to breed cattle.  Currently, thanks to our support, Hurshed has seven cows.  He plans to buy another pair of cows before spring after obtaining this loan.  He will sell them after fattening them up or when the time comes to sell livestock, and will use the resulting profit to plant cucumbers, tomatoes and cabbage, and also melon crops on a leased plot of land.  This is how Hurshed tries to have a regular income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hurshed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":333.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":340.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":340.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-22T23:43:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393608,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"      La se\u00f1ora Sonia esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito con nosotros para poder invertir en su peque\u00f1o negocio de tacos de guisados, el cual le obtiene suficiente ganancias para mantener a sus dos hijos, ya que es madre soltera.\nDo\u00f1a Sonia es originaria de Nuevo Le\u00f3n, pero ya tiene mas de doce a\u00f1os vivienda en la ciudad Nuevo Laredo, lugar donde para sustentar a sus hijos tuvo que ver la diferentes maneras de poder ganar dinero sin descuidar a su familia.

She works very hard because she wishes to improve their living conditions. They live together in a house they own, where they share the good things and face the difficulties that come their way. Elda's work is selling regional food. Every day she goes out to the sidewalk in front of her home and sets up the tables, chairs and all the supplies she needs in order to start selling. Every day she gets a lot of customers who come searching for the delicious dishes she prepares with her own hands which are very skilled at seasoning. The most important thing is that she offers all kinds and varieties of dishes, from the most common to the most rare ones. Her customers always find what they search for and leave satisfied, because she always greets them all with special service and a beautiful smile. She has been in this line of work for three years and during this time she learned that a well-treated customer is one who will come back often.\r\nShe remembers when she got her start in this business. Because they had a low income, she decided to start this business without neglecting her home and, most of all, her children. She currently has many plans, but what she wants for now is to consolidate her business and to begin expanding it in the future. This will be her fifth loan with MFP. She's very glad to know she will have financial support, because this way she will feel more confident as she moves forward with her work. Besides, she enjoys being a part of her communal bank, since all of the members are responsible and very supportive people. With the requested amount of 3.000 soles, she will purchase ingredients so that she can continue preparing her various food dishes. Also, she will invest part of it in getting new kitchenware and providing more security for her venue."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.94,"image":{"id":1007546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase food making supplies and to renew her kitchenware.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":453.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":478.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":476.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":513.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":532.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":545.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":169.94,"local_amount":453.18,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":456.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386553,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T19:32:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396043,"name":"Akouemevo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe AKOUEMEVO est form\u00e9 de trois personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

Ferlina employs someone to help transport the meals, while she is in full production. The results of her business present a level of sales that allow her to cover her operating costs.

Phionah hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nPhionah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Phionah's future prospects by helping her to improved her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83.24,"image":{"id":1011841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more chickens for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"kyengera","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phionah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julien","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":650000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":29200},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29538},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":29881},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30228},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":30580},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":30934},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":31295},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31659},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32026},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":32398},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32775},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33155},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":33540},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33930},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34323},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":34723},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35126},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":35534},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":35947},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33208}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.27},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.11,"local_amount":58738,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":63296.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264133319,"comment":null},{"amount":13.79,"local_amount":29881,"processed_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":32199.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264133320,"comment":null},{"amount":13.95,"local_amount":30228,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":32573.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264133321,"comment":null},{"amount":14.12,"local_amount":30580,"processed_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-22T07:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":32953.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264133322,"comment":null},{"amount":14.27,"local_amount":30934,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-27T07:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":33334.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264133323,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T01:27:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393645,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys es una madre de familia de  42 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 2 hijos con quines vive adem\u00e1s de su esposo en casa propia ubicada en un caser\u00edo rural de nombre Totoral Bajo en el Lte 129 del distrito de Tambogrande el mismo que pertenece a la Provincia de Piura.

In November 2010, with a wide customer base and experience, Rene decided to quit his job and work for himself. He started his Harlingen, Texas, home business, VF Sales & Equipment. About eight months later, his business grew out of his house into a stand-alone store. \r\n\r\nThe business sells and leases construction signs and related equipment to local construction businesses including traffic control companies.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one really that got into it,\u201d he said about the business. \u201cThat\u2019s why we got into it.\u201d Rene services the Brownsville, Alice and McAllen area in South Texas, where, he says, competition is growing. \r\n\r\nHis business employs two full-time workers and one who is part-time. He hopes to hire seven more employees within the next year. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s pushing it; let\u2019s say five,\u201d he said. \u201cSeven would be ultimate. If we open other locations, it\u2019ll be well over seven.\u201d\r\n\r\nRene will use the ACCION Texas loan for working capital and inventory. Right now, he has 15 to 20 pieces such as diesel-powered light towers for overnight construction workers, barrels and various signs. \u201cThere are well over 100 different types (of equipment) that we\u2019d like to have,\u201d Rene said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical,\u201d he said about his ACCION Texas loan. \u201cI think we\u2019ll stay in business because the inventory I\u2019m buying with that loan will help us bring in more revenue and make profit. Without the right inventory, it\u2019s hard to stay in business.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout a loan, Rene said it is difficult to say exactly what would have happened to his business, the profits of which help him support his wife and two daughters. \u201cI would\u2019ve done anything I can,\u201d he said. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt would have definitely hurt us; we might not have been able to continue without it. Originally, the loan was to cover start-up costs. That\u2019s what helped us,\u201d Rene said. \u201cOnce we get over that hump and get that revenue in, I think we\u2019ll be able to stand alone then pay it back quicker than the term.\u201d\r\n\r\nRene said he saw a void in the marketplace for traffic control and construction equipment and VF Sales & Equipment is filling that

She lives in the city of Pisco, a city that is characterized by beautiful beaches, a warm climate, and one of the most beautiful tourist attractions of our country, the Ballestas Islands and the Candelabro. Santos loves Peruvian food, and one of the dishes that she likes most is the very delicious \"aji de gallina\" (chili pepper chicken, a Peruvian chicken stew). She is a mother and has two children whose ages are 4 and 14 and whom she loves very much and who are her reason for living. For economic reasons, she could only go to school up to the fifth grade of secondary education, but she would have liked to study gastronomy, because she very much likes to cook.\r\n\r\nThanks to her good cooking skill in preparing dishes, she began her business selling one of the Peruvian flagship dishes, the very delicious ceviche, 11 months ago. Santosa gets up very early to go in search of the ingredients to prepare this dish. She works about eight hours a day and can serve about 30 customers a day. She believes that she is doing well in her business because she is a good cook and furthermore, she treats her customers in a kindly manner.\r\n\r\nSantosa is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to their help she will be able to buy a freezer and a display case for the sale of her dishes, which will permit her to store the ingredients that she uses in preparation in an optimal manner and to have more order in showing her products.

is 31 years old, married and the father of four children who live in Aden, Yemen. His educational background is Bachelor of Commerce.\r\n\r\nAhmed is very hardworking. With much great effort and dedication, he managed to save money and forge his business, which today is a general store. He works around 12 hours daily. He said that without sacrifice, there is no reward and if one wants to get ahead, you have to do what you can. He believes that his business is going well because his family is his best motivation.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community members. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Annie is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnnie hopes to be able to expand soon.

This kind of work enables her to earn an income and support her family, because she lives with her parents.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked her what she likes about Pro Mujer, she replied that she likes the training sessions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1008232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"to buy liquor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":2900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines Zulma\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madelen Wendy\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gustavo Ariel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neyda Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19858.57,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3309.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3309.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3309.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3309.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3309.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3309.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T01:06:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395993,"name":"Denis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Denis is a 45-year-old married man with five children who lives in Kamwenge, Uganda.

He lives together with his wife and two small children in the Vodyanoye village.  Vitalyi is involved in growing early vegetables in his greenhouses.  He has a large plot of land, three big, 80x100 meter greenhouses, and two greenhouses for seedlings.  Vitalyi has been involved in agriculture for 13 years.  He had invested 110,000 hryvnia into his business.  His annual expenses for seeds and plastic amount to 43,000 hryvnia.

This was a step toward making her business grow. She has had her business for about four years. She started it with a small amount of savings and with her initiative to generate income and be useful.\r\n\r\nClaritza plans to invest this new loan by purchasing underwear for men and women; she is planning to start selling them in wholesale quantities. She plans to use her earnings to reinvest in her business and save. Her dream is to have a well-established business.
