Aside from her own business, she also has one in another place where she has a business partner. They started their joined business in January.

She is pictured above standing in the middle of the group.  One of her children is studying at university while the other two are in high school and junior high school.  She has been selling clothing and electronic equipment on credit for 26 years around her neighborhood.  The business allows her to help her husband by supplementing his income as a caterer and also helps pay school fees for the children.  She hopes that all of her children can succeed in school and attend through university.  She is now requesting her first loan with VisionFund Indonesia to buy more clothing to resell to customers and help pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys having this business because she does not have to sit at home all day and can be out meeting people and sharing stories with them.  Main challenges she faces with her business are when people cannot pay her and the increased competition.  If she ever has enough savings, she'd like to open her own store someday to sell the clothing and electronics from.\r\n\r\nThe other group members will use their loans to help their businesses which include selling cakes, selling ice, and selling cosmetics.

She is pictured in the photo above wearing the green shirt with the white collar, standing with her group in front of her juice stand.  She is 27 years old and married with one child. Her child is four and a half years old and is not old enough for school yet.  Her husband works as an employee at a cafe.  She hopes that with both of their incomes, they will have enough money to send their child to school when it is old enough.\r\n\r\nHer business has been going well because she has many customers.  She is taking her first loan with VisionFund Indonesia to purchase more fruit, straws, cups and a blender.  The blender will enable her to start selling iced drinks to keep up with her competitors.  Eventually she would like to expand her stand to start selling cooked noodles as well.  A few challenges she faces are  that there are competitors in her neighborhood and also sometimes customers owe her money.  Her favorite part of the business is that it allows her to take care of her child while she is selling juice.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.
