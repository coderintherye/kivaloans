Justa dreams of having a store where she can sell her bread without having to stand out in the cold, which would also make things more comfortable for her customers.  The most difficult part of the job is standing outside in the cold selling all morning and afternoon, and sometimes into the evening.

She has already received 2 loans from Prisma Microfinance and she has had no problems in making her payments.

Lorenza wants to provide her children with a good high school education and has worked hard for a good life.  She sells bread in the area around the Central Market (an important market in the city of Puno). Using her baskets, she collects bread from various bakeries and proceeds to sell the loaves. She has been doing this work for 17 years, and the most difficult thing is bearing the chilly evenings in Puno. But the cold doesn't discourage her from continuing to work hard to achieve her dream of providing her children a good high school education and of owning a bakery where she can sell bread to her clients more easily. Lorenza loves chatting with the saleswomen who work next to her, as this makes the evenings at work more enjoyable. This is her second loan from [kiva.org partner] MFP and she has every intention of paying it back on time and, in doing so, avoid having problems with the community bank and its members.

Luz has two years of experience in this business, during which time she has lessened her family's financial burden. The thing she likes most about her job is giving advice to the young women who come to buy dresses. She always tells them which dresses suit them most, or which ones go best with their skin tones. She is a good saleswoman and hopes to have a larger shop where she can sell not only dresses, but also casual clothing. The thing she likes least about her job is having to stay at the shop for long periods of time.

Maria wants to be able to afford to educate her children beyond High School and start them on a good career.  She leaves home very early in order to tend to her stall from which she sells clothing in the Mercado Bellavista (an important market in the city of Puno).  Every day she takes care of customers who come to buy:  she greets them in a happy manner and is very attentive to them.  The hardest part of Maria's job is bringing the clothing from Bolivia as the trip is very long and exhausting.  Nevertheless, she continues firm in the conviction that she will have a larger store in the future, a store where she will be able to offer a greater variety of clothes as her favourite thing is to sell and she is very convincing.  She has had this business for five years now, which has allowed her to give her children a decent life.  This is Maria's first loan with MFP and she is already saving in order to repay the loan.  She always sets aside part of her sales; she is a very active member of her community bank and very responsible.

She has a great desire to get ahead and knows that with hard work she will succeed.  From her life's passion she has developed her business.  Ever since she was a young girl she always liked chocolates.  Later she learned how to make them and now has her own business where she sells her delicious chocotejas (traditional chocolate-based candy from the area of Ica).  She has been in business for nine years, sweetening the palates of her customers.  She most enjoys trying her chocotejas to see how they turned out and she can eat plenty in a short amount of time.  She desires to give her sweets a brand name and sell them in other regions--even to compete with the chocotejas in Ica.  She feels that the hardest part of her job is wrapping her chocotejas, but she knows that she must do it to make them look more presentable.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She knows she has to pay punctually if she wants to get more loans in the future and she is ready to comply with the payment schedule.  Those at her bank meetings wait for her and love that she comes because she always brings her delicious chocotejas.  Marilea will use the requested 900 nuevos soles to buy more ingredients to increase the number of chocotejas sold daily, since the quantity she currently prepares always sells very quickly. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":275900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients for her chocolates","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-21T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":979.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117147,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T20:56:39Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":90668,"name":"Marylin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marylin a sus 19 a\u00f1os, sabe que es hora de apoyar con los gastos econ\u00f3micos en su hogar, vive en la casa de sus padres, quienes le ayudaron a poner su negocio.

She uses techniques which she has learned over time and which give her skirts a nice finished look; the skirts can take up to two months to complete.  She spends most of her time caring for her children as well as the animals she has in a small stable.

She has been embroidering for 2 years. Curiosity inspired her to develop this art with her hands, and the finishing touches she gives her products are her greatest advantage as her customers like her work a lot, and it is therefore a good source of income. Every day she works at home so that approximately one month later she sells and delivers them to the people who have ordered. For Judy this type of work is ideal as it allows her to enjoy, day after day, the work that she does. Among her plans are to improve her production and begin an animal business, which she will do along with her embroidery. This is the first time that Judy has a loan with MFP, and she promises to be one of the most active members of her communal bank. The money she seeks will be used to buy fabric and thread valued at 250 soles and with the other 250 soles she will acquire animals such as sheep and in this way begin her business buying and selling animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":275929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy materials for her embroidery business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-05T01:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":94.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117155,"comment":null},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":94.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012066,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":94.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595652,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":94.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989913,"comment":null},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":94.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211045,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":97.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640538,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-05T05:28:13Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":90679,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis tiene 25 a\u00f1os y vive en casa de sus padres.

","en":"\r\nVilma is 33 years old and lives with her two children in a rented home.  She has dedicated herself to making handcrafts for the last seven years.  Her ingenuity, in addition to the training she has received in handcrafted arts, has allowed her to reach her potential in her abilities and to improve her work by using accessories such as pearls, colored threads, etc.  Vilma makes beautiful wallets or accessories depending on the occasion.  For example, for Christmas she makes decorative ornaments for the living room or kitchen.  Vilma travels to the different mining districts where she already has clients to sell her decorations.  She also travels to other cities but only does so twice a month as her sales are more certain in the mining districts. \r\n\r\nVilma wants to expand her business because it is profitable and because it is a good pastime as she enjoys her work. This is the third loan she has received from MFP and she is one of the most responsible members of her bank and urges others to do the same.  The loan she is requesting will be invested in purchasing materials such as buttons and bag handles as she makes bags and backpacks for the school year. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Manzo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":275977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase materials for her handcrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-21T23:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3020.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841954,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-22T00:57:02Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":90697,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen A. raises pigs in her backyard.

In this plantation, she has a problem because she does not have enough money to buy fertilizer. In order to deal this problem, Mr. Sandab K.'s wife decided to request a loan to purchase fertilizer to make her crops more productive. This couple has three children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory, another attends the local school, and the youngest one is too young to work or study. Mr. Sandab K. is not requesting the loan but his wife is, so she is shown in the photo.  \r\n\r\nAll the members of this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These loans allow borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.

Channy N. is a villager in Ta Pang Choeurng village in Takeo province. She is a coconut seller. Her husband, Mr. Seim Mech, is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice. Aside from this plantation, he helps his wife\u2019s business. <P>\r\n\r\nSince this couple's business is doing well, they want to expand it.

Aside from her store, Novelina is also planning to start in the hog raising business for additional income.  With this, she would like to borrow a loan of PHP 5,000.00 that she can use for business expansion.  With her small businesses, she can save something for herself for she does not want to depend too much on her daughter financially, especially when she gets sick.

Th\u1ecb H., 40 years old, is the group leader.  Her husband, N. V\u0103n Nam, has suffered from a life-threatening illness for the past ten years and has been unable to work.  Thus, she had to find a way to meet the family\u2019s living expenses alone, from buying food to paying her son\u2019s school fees.  Because of the family\u2019s difficulties, her son, now 16, had to leave school after ninth grade and go to work as an apprentice auto mechanic.  In this lending cycle, she is requesting a loan of 3,079,800 VND (~180 USD) to buy vegetable seedlings, fertilizer, and breeding pigs.\r\nThe other members of the group are requesting the same amount.\r\nMrs. N.

They live in Village 5, Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng commune, a poor village in Thanh H\u00f3a province, 156 km south of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i.  Mrs. Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb Th\u01b0 is the group leader.  Her family has faced serious financial difficulties ever since her husband passed away at an early age, leaving her to raise five young children alone.  In the previous lending cycle, she used a loan to buy breeding hens and then sold off the additional chickens produced.  The profit from that enterprise, 500,000 VND (30 USD), she set aside to pay for her children\u2019s education.  In this lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 2,442,600 VND (~145 USD) to buy breeding hens again, as well as fertilizer for her rice field. \r\nThe other members of the group are requesting the same amount.\r\nMrs. C. Th\u1ecb Ph\u00fac will use her loan to buy rice to make rice pancakes and rice paper. \r\nMrs. Q. Th\u1ecb Ti\u1ebfn will use her loan to buy vegetables she can sell at the market.\r\nMrs. N.

J. is a 40-year-old woman who has been running a clothing sales business since 2000 at \"Narantuul,\" the biggest outdoor market in Mongolia. Ninety percent of the clothes she sells are sewn by her husband. Her husband used to work at a clothing factory as a cutter and tailor. In 2000, her husband was laid off because of adverse conditions with the business. Nyamjanyan had had her own clothing business since 1996 -- buying clothes at the Chinese border city of Ereen and reselling them at a local market -- but in 2000, they began to run a family clothing business together. Nyamjanyan's husband sews men's suits and topcoats, and she irons and sells them. He sews and she irons 2-3 items per day. The average cost of each suit and coat is MNT 20,000-30,000 (USD $13-20), and they resell them for an average price of MNT 35,000-60,000 ($25-40 USD).

His wife is a homemaker. Vali is a dentist with 15 years of experience working at the local dental clinic. This year, Vali plans to celebrate a wedding for one of his daughters. His daughter is a college student and many young men wish to marry her. Vali needs this loan to provide for a proper dowry and pay for the wedding party. Vali D. is a good doctor and has many loyal patients. Unfortunately, due to frequent interruptions of electric power in the local clinic, Vali's workload there decreased. As an alternative, Vali D. is working at a private clinic where he can work without interruption. Vali thanks all Kiva lenders for their generosity and hopes to apply for another Kiva loan soon to finance opening of a private practice.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk,

To be able to decrease the expenses for  fuel and consequently to reduce the fees for his services, Saifullo is planning to replace the fuel supply system on his minivan. He is requesting a loan of $800 USD. Saifullo thanks everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan in 12 months.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key place along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thanks to the quality of her products and the experience she gained in this sphere of business, she has earned a solid reputation among her customers and the demand for her goods has grown.  This has allowed Shazada to contribute significantly to the household. Now Shazada requests a loan of $550 USD for the term of 8 months. She is going to use the loan to purchase dried apricots with the purpose of processing and reselling them.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They average 23 years of age and 3 children. They live in nuclear traditional families, with their children and husbands, in the city of Dio\u00efla, in the Koulikoro region in the Republic of Mali. They got acquainted through business bonds. Anxious to improve their businesses, they joined Kiva's partner, the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from which they are seeking their tenth solidarity loan (group loan). None of the previous loans was affected by bad reimbursement.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, they intend to buy 600 kg of eggplants, 280 kg of oranges, 120 kg of papayas, and a large amount of green vegetables.

M. is the father of four adult children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, he has been able to get ahead in business through the purchase of animals to breed on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Sharifjon is asking for a  loan of $800 USD for the purchase of animals so that he may breed them. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He can buy these things right there in the market of S\u00e9gou. <P>\r\n\r\nMr.  Bamady   Bouar\u00e9   sells for cash or on credit to a clientele composed of men and women. He hopes to make a monthly profit of 96,000 F CFA which will be used as working capital and for certain family expenses. His ambition is to have a good chicken yard and well cared for layers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Initially he used his truck to only transport animals which he was selling but he noticed that in each village where livestock was sold, this transportation service was in high demand and so he went into this line of business.  He travels constantly from city to city, always buying products from each area to sell at his next destination.  Now, with the school year starting, it is the best time of year for him to make the greatest profit because demand for his services is so high.  Cerilo's goal is to acquire another truck to increase his profit.  This is his third loan with his community bank and MFP.  He has found the loan experience to be very satisfactory.

However,  the city government started to restrict licenses for ambulatory salespeople and she had to abandon selling in the streets and move to the marketplace.\r\n\r\nShe became interested in selling clothing when she started to sell clothing at wholesale prices out of her house.

He just finished building an artificial turf field in the Chincha province that he can rent out to different customers when they want to practice any type of sport, particularly soccer.  Seeing the opportunity for a food stand, Alma had no doubt about starting to prepare food and sell it to the families or groups of friends that came to use the field.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, she has only been working at this business for two months but she has great expectations for it.  Her future plans include building a small restaurant at the same location.  On the other hand, for about a year now, she has also dedicated herself to making earrings, bracelets, and necklaces.  Previously, she worked at a textile mill for several years, but she had to resign when the factory moved to a distant district that was too far from her home.

He's been constantly working in his brick factory for the past 5 years to build himself a better future. He started as a simple day laborer, but after some time, with their savings he and his brother financed the purchase of a plot of land that contains clay. They currently have their own brick production operation there, and they sell their bricks in construction material markets nearby. They also sell their bricks to particular builders. For his future, Amador wants his own plot of land to increase his income. He has difficulty producing bricks quickly during rainy weather, but he has recently acquired a large amount of plastic tarps to protect himself from the constant rains.

Although he is 66 years old, he continues to be a very hard worker, and it was only last year that he started his own business. He sells the raw materials needed to make other products out of wood. But although Alfonso has an extensive network of clients who pay cash for his products, he has not been able to make much of a profit because his inventory is so small. It is for this reason that Alfonso is requesting a loan. He would like to increase the range of products he offers and thus, increase his sales. A loan would also help him improve the condition of his store, which is currently infested with insects that are ruining his wood and are obviously a very serious problem for the quality of his service. In these ways, capital would help him improve the profitability of his business and increase his household's income. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

Now he would like to stock up on supplies for the start of summer - in march and april - when the climatic conditions are the best for brick making. This is the first loan Antonio will be receiving from MFP and he very much wants to work hard for the good of his communal bank, and intends to make his payments punctually. The money he is requesting will be invested into his factory. It will help pay the labourers' salaries and will be used to buy fuel for the brick baking oven. The labourers receive 80 soles a day and the fuel, bought by the truckload, costs 500 soles. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":276674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy fuel and pay labourers' salaries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-24T01:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-24T03:11:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":91057,"name":"Angela Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa se\u00f1ora Angela M. es una dama que se dedica a su negocio de venta de ropa, decoraciones, cosm\u00e9ticos y productos de belleza en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n en el municipio de Ciudad Sandino donde atiende su negocio.\n\nEs de importancia destacar que se ha desarrollado grandemente y por esta raz\u00f3n ha logrado salir adelante habiendo adquirido su vitrina para exhibir sus productos.

He is seeking a loan to buy merchandise such as hammocks, blankets, sheets and belts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kahn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":276690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase merchandise such as sheets, blankets, hammocks and belts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Carapegua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.8 -57.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-02-24T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virgilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094480,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35987944,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44569130,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959444,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176721,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-29T09:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176722,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602339,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-18T09:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038572,"comment":null},{"amount":111.12,"local_amount":555555.52,"processed_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-24T09:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":563333.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951037,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-24T19:19:12Z","paid_date":"2009-11-24T09:02:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":91069,"name":"Fredy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fredy tiene 42 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposa e hijos.

Nelia supported her husband in their business and for now she is asking for financial support to the lenders amounting to PHP4,000.

To further support her business, she is now asking for a loan of PHP4,000.  This amount will not only be used for her direct selling business but also to repair their boat that they are using for transporting their passengers.

and hard work will someday provide good income\u201d, says Maribel, a quotation that motivates her in the business.  \r\n\r\nMaribel R. is a rice retailer in their village in Barangay Lullutan Ilagan, Isabela. She is married to Roberto, a farmer and they have two children: Clenton -15 years old, elementary graduate and Jesus - 9 years old, elementary student. Poverty is their reason why they were not able to send their eldest to school and pursue his studies.  She said that she and her husband are striving hard to uplift their life from poverty in a way they can.  \r\n\r\nMaribel wanted to avail a loan of PHP4,000 as business capital.  She will use the loan to purchase three sacks of rice that she sells in retail and hopefully increase her current monthly income of PHP1,000 (USD$21) which is really not enough to meet their needs.  She is glad that her husband is also earning something from their farm during harvest season.  She works hard in her business and save something for the high school education of their children.
