She is 42 years old, married, and has three children. Her husband worked hard, but unfortunately his salary did not cover the expenses of their household at all. In 1993, in order to find a means of subsistence, they went off to Russia in search of a living and worked in a cafe. In 2006 they came back to Kyrgyzstan and opened a cafeteria in Osh city, using a start-up capital of 20,000 KGS. They worked a lot to make their caf\u00e9 one of the most popular places, and achieved success. \r\n\r\nBut in June of 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in Osh city, Gulsara lost her business. Her cafeteria was robbed and burned. But Gulsara, being a very optimistic person, didn\u2019t give in. In order to reconstruct her cafeteria, she decided to engage in reselling foodstuffs. She rented a selling place at the local market and took different kinds of frozen goods on credit from her business partners. This fact indicates a great confidence in Gulsara\u2019s personality and the prosperous future of her business.\r\n \r\nNow, Gulsara is applying for a loan of 135.000 KGS, which she needs to broaden her assortment of goods.

This is how she values things, small or great, and opportunities that come her way. She is married to Vergelio and is blessed with 2 children who are currently in high school. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines. Having finished only high school, Pacita is determined to pursue her desire of having her own business to have a good life and a bright future for her children. \r\n\r\nShe has operated her own buy-and-sell business of golf balls for 20 years now. She basically purchases these balls in bulk and repacks them into 150-200 PHP per pack and sells them to golfers. Her store is strategically located outside the Philippine Navy Golf Course in Taguig City, Metro Manila.  It is quite accessible to all golf players. She also offers candies and cold drinks (mineral water and soft drinks). Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of around 10,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operation of her business, Pacita is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this amount to purchase additional golf balls and candies to restock her inventory. She believes through the proper use of this loan, she will increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nPacita dreams of having her house renovated soon and be able to send her child all the way through college. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

Th\u1ecb, age 75, is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 1 M\u1eadt S\u01a1n 1 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 (08.02.1 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7).\r\n \r\nD\u1ee5 lives in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. She is widowed and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, D\u1ee5 owns and operates a food stall, selling peanuts in the local community. D\u1ee5 has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, D\u1ee5 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. D\u1ee5 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,253,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  She is now requesting her second loan of 6,159,600 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and employed as working capital. D\u1ee5 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\nL\u00ea Th\u1ecb V\u00e2n (age 32), L\u00ea Th\u1ecb K\u1ef7 (age 70), and C.

Mariano Rogelio is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Mariano Rogelio from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Additionally, the experience she has with planting has allowed to her to learn the necessary techniques for harvesting the entire crop without problems.

The sales give them a regular income that allow them to live comfortably with their daughter.\r\n\r\nSince she is a very hard-working woman, she plans to increase her gladiolus flower and pea production since the prices of those items are very good at the market.

In the future he plans to raise a larger quantity of beans and peas, since the prices for these crops are stable in the market.  He also wants to begin raising cattle.\r\n\r\nThis will be his fifth loan through MFP and he is grateful to all the people who made this loan possible, allowing him to continue working.  He also says that his workgroup is one of the best because all of the members make their payments on time and this helps them to continue moving forward.

Her principal activity is her dressmaking shop, which she started some 13 years ago. As an additional activity, she also gives classes in painting textiles.\r\n\r\nDiana is requesting a loan to purchase material for her dressmaking shop (mainly cloth), plus materials for her painting classes. In this manner, she hopes to make both businesses grow.  Upon soliciting the loan, she felt enthusiastic because with this, she hopes to fix up her workspace to conform perfectly to the needs of her shop, and to invest in publicity for her painting classes. In this way, she can increase her earnings, which will permit her to have a better quality of life for her and all her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":744242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"TO PURCHASE

Agricultural work is not easy at all and Cipriano takes care of the land with a great deal of dedication. He starts his days at the break of dawn to start the work, adding the ingredients necessary to make them more fertile and strong and getting them ready so that the harvest will be very productive.

Six seasons ago, they formed a group to be able to take advantage of the benefits offered through Fundacion Espoir.\r\n\r\nIn this place, we got to know Dolores: she is 40 years old and is in a common-law marraige with her spouse, with whome she has two children who are 12 and 17.  Both of her children are still students.  Her husand is a farmer.\r\n\r\nWith the help of their children, she and her husband raise corn, peanuts, and fruit like melons and watermelons.  They can raise these crops all year as their land is close to a river and they are able to easily irrigate their crops.  They work Monday to Friday from 7 am to noon and from 1 pm to 3 pm.  When it is harvest time, they deliver their crops to the salesmen who come to their home to buy them; the salesmen take them to other cities to sell.\r\n\r\nThis loan to buy agriculture products, seeds, chemical fertilizers and other fertilizer to have a good harvest.  She has been in the village bank for 2 seasons and she likes it beause of the help she receives and because they don't ask for so many prerequisites to give loans.\r\n\r\nHer dream is have a house made of cement since her current home is made of cane\/reeds."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":744340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase agriculture products, chemical fertilizers, and other fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-04-05T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Egbelida Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Edith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Biolinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elisa Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fermina Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baleria Vespertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Stefania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduvis Asunci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mariana De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Leonor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hirlanda Mallita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lorena Marizol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4785,"loan_amount":4800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":478.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":960,"local_amount":957,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206152216,"comment":null},{"amount":960,"local_amount":957,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211225048,"comment":null},{"amount":1440,"local_amount":1435.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216503841,"comment":null},{"amount":960,"local_amount":957,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221667784,"comment":null},{"amount":480,"local_amount":478.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":480,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036570,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T12:29:54Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287815,"name":"William Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLAS AMISTOSAS\u201d;

Con este trabajo, puede solventar sus gastos familiares. Actualmente, Nazario desea invertir en la educaci\u00f3n de su hija. Su mayor anhelo es mejorar el nivel de educaci\u00f3n que su hija recibe para que ella pueda obtener mejores oportunidades en el futuro. Por ello, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo a Edpyme Alternativa de 500 nuevos soles para ayudar con sus gastos escolares. Este pr\u00e9stamo permitir\u00e1 que Nazario trabaje m\u00e1s tranquilo sin tener que recurrir a prestamistas informales que le cobrar\u00edan tasas alt\u00edsimas, lo cual perjudica su liquidez diaria y retrasa su crecimiento tanto comercial como familiar. Agradece a los prestamistas de Kiva por su apoyo en sacar adelante a su familia.

With this work, he is able to pay his family's expenses.\r\n\r\nAt present, Nazario wishes to invest in the education of his daughter. His greatest hope is to improve the level of education his daughter receives so that she can obtain better opportunities in the future. For this reason, he has solicited a loan through Edpyme Alternativa for 500 new sols to help with school expenses. The loan will permit Nazario to work more tranquilly without having to resort to loans from informal loan sharks who charge very high rates, which would prejudice Nazario's daily liquidity and set back both his commercial and family growth.\r\n\r\nHe is very grateful to Kiva for its help in moving his family ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":745007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"TO PAY FOR THE EDUCATION OF HIS DAUGHTER","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ort\u00edz - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-04-06T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":93.49},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":97.04},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":99.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":103.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.4},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.53},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.4,"local_amount":93.49,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:47:12Z","rounded_local_amount":104.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206138194,"comment":null},{"amount":38.81,"local_amount":97.04,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":108.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210754,"comment":null},{"amount":39.67,"local_amount":99.17,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":111.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489012,"comment":null},{"amount":41.53,"local_amount":103.83,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":116.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205188,"comment":null},{"amount":42.59,"local_amount":106.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":119.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181933,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-06T02:09:18Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:02:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287882,"name":"Pha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan consists of fourteen members.

To make a living, Marcelina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Marcelina has been engaged in her business for over 38 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP every three months.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marcelina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marcelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. Marcelina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This is the 3rd loan taken out by Marcelina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

years old and married with seven children. He works as a farmer and raises livestock, as well as sells milk and meat. He has 20 years of experience in his work. He likes his work, and he stands out in his field of work through his attention to detail and cleanliness. He owns a good number of livestock, though he is facing difficulties in procuring feed for them, just as he is facing difficulties in keeping up his farm.

She believes that her entrepreneurial skills, land, good climate and a constant desire to learn something new will push the level of the business upward. The only thing she lacks is financial capital. For this reason she gathered a group of ambitious private entrepreneurs like her and applied for a loan from Kiva, cooperating with its field partner in Kyrgyzstan Mol Bulak Finance. \r\n\r\nNazira will start with the purchase of 500 kg of potato seeds. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is a single mother of five children but only four of them still live with her in her own house located in the outskirts of the city of San Rafael (Peruvian central jungle).  \r\n\r\nShe tries to avoid talking about the difficult situation she lived with the father of her children.  But she does state that what she managed to rescue from the experience is to value herself as a woman and, being very enterprising, she started to sell beer and carbonated soft drinks with the goal of supporting her children.  She also prepares food to sell at her tourist stop \u2018La Inolvidable\u201d (The Unforgettable One) that she recently opened.  On the other hand, she raises ducks and chickens that are later sold or used in the preparation of her stews.  Daniela\u2019s children help her and this is why the business is profitable: she does not have to pay salaries to kitchen help.  \r\n\r\nHer enterprising spirit led her to set up a farm in order to sell small farm animals at wholesale because sometime ago she made a good amount of money selling guinea pigs by the dozen.  Proudly she adds:  \u201cI raised 120 chickens.  I cared for them since they were very young and sold them for 35 soles a piece.

These include citrus fruits, coffee, and bananas and she works with the help of paid farmhands.  She likes to harvest because it\u2019s there where she can see the value of her efforts.

She is able to live without any concerns, but she knows that she will eventually not be able to care for her land anymore, so she has set aside some space in her home to set up a little grocery store.  She is a member of the \u201cLas Brisas\u201d communal bank and this will be her eighth loan through MFP.  As the group\u2019s president, she ensures that the members meet their commitments.

She lives with her children and husband on the outskirts of the city of San Ram\u00f3n in the central Peruvian jungle.  From the early hours of the morning, she begins selling her rich cakes that she prepared the day before.  Esther says that she sells an average of four cakes, which generate considerable earnings.  What she enjoys most about her work is mixing the batter.  \u201cThis is the secret to making a good cake,\u201d Esther claims.  There are hardly any shops or bakeries in her area, so selling the cakes she prepares is quite profitable.  However, the lack of capital limits her work.  For this reason, she is working hard to save enough money to buy an artisan oven for making cakes, buns, and other baked goods.  Esther says, \u201cI do all I can to provide my children with a good education.\u201d  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cLas Brisas\u201d (The Breezes) and this is her seventh loan with MFP.  Esther is grateful for the support she constantly receives.  During the coffee harvesting season, she sells more cakes.  For this reason, the loan she is requesting will be used to buy supplies such as flour, eggs, and butter in large quantities for making cakes.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":745355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase flour, eggs, and butter for making cakes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-06T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":94.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":98.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":102.22},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":114.97},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":119.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":124.35},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":129.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.44,"local_amount":94.5,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":99.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196481,"comment":null},{"amount":36.86,"local_amount":98.29,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":103.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270159,"comment":null},{"amount":38.33,"local_amount":102.22,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":107.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550179,"comment":null},{"amount":39.86,"local_amount":106.3,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":111.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718856,"comment":null},{"amount":41.46,"local_amount":110.56,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":116.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350323,"comment":null},{"amount":43.12,"local_amount":114.97,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850817,"comment":null},{"amount":44.83,"local_amount":119.57,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":125.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665960,"comment":null},{"amount":46.64,"local_amount":124.35,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":130.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621145,"comment":null},{"amount":48.46,"local_amount":129.24,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":135.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-06T09:44:27Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288058,"name":"Jose Humberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 27 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Corinto departamento de Moraz\u00e1n, vive con su familia y su hijo de 2 a\u00f1os y medio, \u00e9l se dedica a la crianza de ganado y cerdo, lo realiza hace 3 a\u00f1os y lo aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres, comercializa los cerdos y el ganado los mi\u00e9rcoles y domingo, que son los d\u00edas de comercio de Corinto.\nActualmente est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de concentrado para los cerdos y alimento para el ganado, este pr\u00e9stamo le ayudara a cubrir el gasto y tendr\u00e1 como alimentar a sus animales durante un tiempo.\nSu objetivo es ampliarse con el n\u00famero de ganado y cerdos, ya que de \u00e9l dependen sus ingresos y el sostenimiento de su familia.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 27 years old and resides in Corinto in the Department of Moraz\u00e1n.
