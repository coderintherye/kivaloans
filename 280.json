R. is from the village of Gumbil, Tudela, Misamis Occidental.

The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Teresita joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase piglets to raise and sell in future. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be her seventh from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":394480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

She hails from Amadeo, a town in Cavite province, famous for its aromatic coffee.  Her husband Gilmore, 50, is a police officer.  They have three children.\r\n\r\nMaria Cecilia owns and manages a computer shop located in downtown Amadeo.  Her computer shop is relatively new, as she just opened last year, but it has shown promising results.  She caters to students attending a nearby school.  She now earns approximately $200 a month.  Her profits are enough to sustain her family\u2019s needs, especially her children\u2019s education.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative just this year but the loans provided by the cooperative have already been very helpful in the growth of her business.  She was able to buy more computer units for her shop.\r\n\r\nMaria Cecilia has applied for a new loan from the cooperative in the amount of P8,000.00.  She will use the funds to buy an additional computer unit.  She hopes to furnish her shop with at least ten personal computers to address the growing demands of customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":394482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"To buy another computer unit for her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Amadeo, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2009-09-26T00:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T14:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1657.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87016786,"comment":null},{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T16:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2210.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96929336,"comment":null},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2210.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103770056,"comment":null},{"amount":11.67,"local_amount":533.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":552.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110658837,"comment":null},{"amount":11.67,"local_amount":533.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":552.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110658838,"comment":null},{"amount":11.66,"local_amount":533.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":552.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110658839,"comment":null},{"amount":11.67,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":552.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110658840,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-26T06:06:27Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T12:28:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":139766,"name":"Idermunkh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Idermunkh is 35 years old and lives with his wife and nine-year-old son in the Uyurkhangai province of Mongolia.

G., 56, may have lost almost all of her family\u2019s precious belongings in a fire that razed their village in the middle of a shanty town in Pasay City in 2007, but she did not lose faith. She was able to \u201crise from the ashes\u201d together with her three children.\r\n<p>\r\nLucia has a general store which had been growing steadily over the years. Then she was challenged when one of her children was afflicted by a crippling cerebral palsy. She was in great emotional pain. Medical expenses took a heavy toll on their finances. Just when she was almost adjusted to their situation, the fire razed their village. Picking up her life\u2019s pieces, Lucia re-established her general store just after the fire (the same year she joined the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative). Perseverance paid off and she is now earning 24,000 PHP a month. She is using her profits to gradually renovate their house and support her children\u2019s education as well.  \r\n<p>\r\nLucia is now asking for a loan of 20,000 PHP as additional capital for her business. She will also use a portion of the fund to continue the renovations on her house.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response to poverty and social injustice.

She is very well experienced in the sale of general foodstuffs; she launched this business in 1994. She has a keen sense of management, which mean that she is currently enlarging her shop. In fact, at the moment she is currently selling pharmaceutical products, \"generic products\" which earn good revenues for her. In the future she intends to also sell \"pagnes\" (colorful wax cloth) and to open another boutique in a different neighborhood of her choosing. She has an urgent need to renew her stock of certain products - it is for this reason that she is requesting a loan from the micro-finance institution WAGES. She will use the loan to purchase 5 cartons of Pick brand milk, 5 cartons of pasta, 3 cartons of tomatoes, 12 boxes of paracetamol and several other products.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These give better yields to their crops, since they prevent the soil from deteriorating so much, provide better conditions for cultivation at planting time and improve the quality of the crop, increasing its value since organic products currently obtain better prices in the market.

Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With her loan, Evelin hopes to expand her business as a shoe saleswoman. Typically, customers will order a certain style or color of shoes, and Evelin will buy them and bring them to the customer\u2019s home. This business plan helps  differentiate her from shoe salespeople who only sell on the street or in shops. Evelin is taking out this loan to help her diversify the selection of shoes available to her customers.<p>\r\n\r\nEvelin hopes that she can continue to receive loans after her first loan is repaid. Eventually, she would like to have her own store and greatly expand her line of offered products.

They live in Batey Caimito, a beautiful community in the hills of the east-central region of the Dominican Republic. A batey is a community of sugarcane field workers in the rural areas of the Dominican Republic. Bateyes are very remote, hard to access, and most people live in deep poverty. They often lack potable water, medicine, and any kind of reliable electricity.\n\nIn order to feed her family and send her children to school, Olga sells used clothing to her community. Typically, packs of used clothes will arrive from the United States, and Olga will buy them to sell for a profit. She will also use this loan to purchase charcoal, a valuable commodity in a community without reliable electricity. \n\nOlga hopes that she will be able to send her two boys to university, giving them a step up in society. One will soon be done with high school, and the other is just entering middle school. This is Olga\u2019s fourth loan with Esperanza, and she has a perfect repayment record!

She prepares and serves her customers with very tasty fish in the market and for that reason she is fun of many. She buys stocks of fish from Yeji in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. She is 35years old widowed and mother with two children. All the children are in school. She supports her children from the business proceeds. She depends on that for their food, school bills and sometimes their medical bills.

","en":"\r\n\r\n\tThis group is located in Tenextepango, A. municipality, state of Morelos. It\u2019s made of 4 members who are Mrs. Silvia N. C., whose works making hand-embroidered napkins and tablecloths, Mrs. Armanda R. A., who has a mechanic shop, and Mrs. Carmela A. V., who works selling cosmetics by catalog. Currently, they are in their third cycle. This group was formed on the recommendation from a member of another group.\r\n\r\n\tAt this time, we would like to call your attention to Mrs. Armanda R. A.. She is now 34 years old. Her family consists of her husband, her 8-year-old son, and she is presently 4 months pregnant. Mrs. Armanda has been part of this group since the first cycle. Currently, she has a loan of $5000, which she invested in valves, patches and calibrators, since her business is a mechanic shop, \u201cDiaz,\u201d that offers service in patching and sales of new and used tires.\r\n\r\nShe began her mechanic shop two and a half years ago, because she was working in a large tire shop in the city of Cuautla. Her bosses offered her a shop rental in the center of the market of Cuautla, so that she could establish her own business. When she told her husband, who was employed at the time, he agreed to open the shop, and they did. After some time, with the earnings from their first shop, they established another and, with government support, bought a tire press and balancer. Their second business was born, located in Tenextepango and tended by the brother-in-law of Mrs. Armanda, who has experience in two other mechanic shops. However, he says with pride that the customers prefer the service at this shop for its speed and efficiency, due to the fact that they use machines to do what other businesses do by hand, which takes more time. \r\n\r\nHer plans are to continue investing in their businesses, to get the investment for utilities needed for their home (floor, ironwork and exterior walls). The motivation that drives them is the desire to give their children a good home.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, they want to offer alignment, however to give this service would require approximately $100,000 in capital. At this moment, they do not want to grossly indebt themselves with a loan this large. So they keep working until this loan is more realistic and give thanks for the trust that they have been offered through these loans. They say that they have served them well. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":390144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase valves, patches and calibrators","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TENEXTEPANGO, CD AYALA, MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Armanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1391.81},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1421.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1451.15},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1481.76},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1513.02},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1544.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1577.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1610.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1644.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.87},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.81},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":206.61,"local_amount":2754.86,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2795.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952647,"comment":null},{"amount":106.59,"local_amount":1421.17,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1442.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952648,"comment":null},{"amount":108.84,"local_amount":1451.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794803,"comment":null},{"amount":111.13,"local_amount":1481.76,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1503.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794804,"comment":null},{"amount":113.48,"local_amount":1513.02,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794805,"comment":null},{"amount":115.87,"local_amount":1544.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1567.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685962,"comment":null},{"amount":118.31,"local_amount":1577.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1600.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685963,"comment":null},{"amount":120.81,"local_amount":1610.81,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1634.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080306,"comment":null},{"amount":123.36,"local_amount":1644.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1668.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080307,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T13:58:38Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":139939,"name":"Stephen Kungu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stephen N. is married with no children yet.

Enid ensures that the family gets three meals a day. \r\n\r\nEnid resides and works in a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Kampala, and she works seven days a week. Enid owns a grocery shop in Kawala, selling soap, sugar, tea leaves, and other merchandise. She buys this merchandise from Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in the city of Kampala. She incurs extra transport costs to and from shopping. The major challenges she faces in her business are seasonality and the increasing prices of merchandise as well as high transport costs and defaulters. Enid has been in this business for ten years. \r\n\r\nShe and her group mate have been with MCDT for five years and are now requesting their tenth loan.

In 2006, he opened his welding shop in the K\u00e9gu\u00e9 district in Lom\u00e9.  This business enables him in particular to provide for his wife and four children.  It also enables him to cover the costs of leasing his shop.  He buys sheets of steel in Ghana, the neighboring country.  This allows him to make quality doors and gates.  Many people come to him to buy or order gates.  He has even recruited two apprentices to help him in his work.  He also makes other items out of steel by special order.  \r\n\r\nCurrently he needs to order some sheets of steel from Ghana.

She and her husband have three children (ages 6, 4, and 1).  They live in the district of Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz, which is located 5 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nShe makes and sells yogurt, a trade she learned while attending an institute in Chiclayo.  She has been in business for 4 years and sells her products daily at the outdoor Moshoqueque Market from 6:30am to 12pm.  In the afternoons, she buys the ingredients she needs to prepare the next batch of yogurt that she will sell the following day.  She also distributes her product to different stores in the area and at specialty fairs where she is invited.\r\n<p>\r\n Her husband bought a moto-taxi (a motorcycle with a sidecar for transporting cargo or passengers) to help her distribute her merchandise.  He also uses it to provide transportation services.  Excessive use of the vehicle has resulted in engine failure, so Gladis is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 800 soles.  She will use the money to make repairs to the vehicle as well as buy more ingredients so that she can expand her yogurt business.\r\n<p>\r\nGladis dreams of building a house because her family currently lives in a rented home.  She also dreams of continued success in her business so that she can open her own location where she can produce and sell yogurt.  She is well known among her customers and they appreciate the care she puts into making a quality product.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Chapi D. Yanacoto group are hardworking people that, owing to different circumstances, are looking to improve their lives honorably.  They are engaged in the sale of: food, sweets, candy, handicrafts, and other items.  The members have participated in EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD for over 3 and a half years.  The loans that they have been provided with have helped them very much.  Here are some of their stories:  Bacilia F. Calder\u00f3n has sold fish and fruit for 25 years.  After her husband abandoned her, she had to work in this manner to support her four small children.  She had to figure out how to sell these products in the street.  At first the income was low, because she was not well-known by her customers, so she had to work as a cook in a communal kitchen.  She came to win customers over time, so that her earnings increased; the perseverance of Bacilia maD. the business grow.  In this way she moved her family forward, making sure that her children would study in school, and be well-dressed and fed.  The first loan that Bacilia received from EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD was used to buy utensils and drinks to sell ceviche on the weekends, days that are the best for sales due to the sporting events that take place in the area where she resides.  Two years ago she changed the straw mats in her home to wood to make her family more comfortable, and this was all done with income from her business.  The current loan will be used to purchase plates, vegetables, and meat for the preparation of caldo D. mote (a typical dish of the Peruvian mountains).  This way she will continue to educate her youngest child who is 9 years old.  \r\n\r\nCarmen P\u00e9rez Bendez\u00fa is the treasurer of the group.  She is in charge of making sure that all the members make their payments on their loans.  Carmen began cleaning rooms in a golf club when her oldest child was a year old.  She was a single mother at the time.  She saved a little money and invested in groceries which she sold from a space in her house.  Later she bought two crates of beer with the earnings from her groceries, and this transaction was profitable.  This created more earnings, income that covered her family expenses, such as education for her two children of  fourteen and five years.  In addition, she was able to improve her house and purchase domestic appliances.  She needs capital to invest in soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nAna Rodr\u00edguez G., president of the communal bank, learned how to make handicrafts when she was still in school.  This interested her so much that she obtained more training in this area, taking advantage of her talent in handicrafts to make small dolls, animals, caps, and handbags from corrospun (sheets of plastic) and polartec fabric.  She offers her products to her friends and to the schools to decorate the classrooms of the children.  Her products are so cute that she has obtained an increasing demand from her customers.  She used her first loan to purchase corrospun, silicone, indelible markers, and synthetic cotton to make a Santa Claus, reindeer, little trees, and elves at Christmastime.  These sales have allowed Ana to share the household expenses with her husband, because he does not have a steady job.  In the month of March, he secured the concession of a primary school.  There he sells sandwiches, fruit popsicles, candy and food.  She needs capital to establish this new business and to continue to educate their two children in private schools; their objective is to give them a peaceful life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":394883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T07:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bacilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilza Maruja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines Asiria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Calixta Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Eileen Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nely Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5800,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939353,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780193,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669061,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064521,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-22T00:51:43Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140060,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia Gladis;

They rent out suits for children and adults, and shoes.  The merchandise that they rent is purchased in Gamarra - Lima.  Gamarra is a large commercial and industrial center in Peru, and it is big in the field of textiles for business people.  We can find a variety of options for whatever age there.  The products they make are exported to other countries.\r\n\r\nThis communal bank has worked with EDAPROSPO-PROPERIDAD for one year.  During that time Jessica continues to be the treasurer of the group.  Before starting in the business of renting gentlemen\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing, Jessica V. U. studied design and production in an educational and occupational center.  Thanks to her work making and repairing clothes she got together the necessary capital to invest in renting clothing.  At the beginning she bought 20 suits for adults and 10 for children, one dozen pairs of children\u2019s shoes, one dozen ties, and one dozen shirts.  Six years have passed, and she appreciates that the business has grown a lot.  Everything is due to the dedication and perseverance she had when confronted with the problems that all businesses have.  Today, at 29 years old, she has 100 suits for adults, 90 for children, 5 dozen pairs of shoes, 4 dozen ties, and 8 dozen shirts.  Every half year she has to update her merchandise due to her discriminating customers who go with the changing fashions.  Her sales have made it possible for her to acquire a small piece of land, which she plans to build on later.  She would also like to rent another place so that it will not take more than two years to get together the money that is needed to start a family.  That is why she needs a loan.\r\n\r\n Sof\u00eda F. H. started working as a helper in a bookstore that her aunt ran.  The business did not turn out the way she hoped.  She then had to work in golf clubs selling candy, ice cream, cotton candy, and popcorn.  But, this income was not enough to support her and her baby.  Three years ago she set up a business of renting clothing for women and girls.  At the start she helped her aunt in the business, and then she became partners with her.  She bought 15 dresses for women and girls.  Her dedication and effort caused her sales to grow, and she has come to have 200 dresses and 50 pairs of shoes for women and girls.  With this income she educates her son, buys food, and pays for her studies in primary education at the university.  She will use this loan to pay for her last semester at the university, and the other part of the loan she will put into her business.\r\n\r\nRita Alegr\u00eda E. also rents dresses and suits for special social events.  She and a friend started with a small quantity of merchandise two years ago.  Like the others, she buys merchandise in Gamarra if she wants clothing, and she gets shoes in footwear shops.  She updates her clothes every so often.  She needs the loan to get more merchandise because the spring season and school promotions (November and December) are approaching.  There is a greater demand during those months, and her income increases.  She wants to build a room in her mother\u2019s house for her 13 year old son to be more comfortable.  She wants to have an adequate quality of life for herself and her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":394904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy textile products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T07:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Leonidas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Larissa Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azucena Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodolfo Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jessica Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crumaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10200,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2040}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":715}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":715,"local_amount":2040,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2052.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939354,"comment":null},{"amount":715,"local_amount":2040,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2052.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780194,"comment":null},{"amount":715,"local_amount":2040,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2052.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669062,"comment":null},{"amount":1430,"local_amount":4080,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4104.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064522,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-29T20:10:14Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140072,"name":"Antonio Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"el sr.

Since that time, the ten members have received loans that have helped to improve their businesses, with the goal of improving their quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s treasurer, Grace R. A., decided four years ago to start selling groceries from her home. She did this with money that her husband gave her. She saved it up to buy two sacks of rice, 1 sack of sugar, 1 case of cooking oil, 1 case of canned food, and 1 package of noodles to start a grocery store. She has had some ups and downs with this business, but Grace\u2019s administrative skills caused her business to grow. Because of this she was able to improve her house, finish educating her children in school, and get her oldest son started in a technical degree program. Grace and her husband decided to invest in a vehicle that they rent out so that they can continue to generate additional income. They were able to do this with loans that they obtained from EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD plus her husband\u2019s income as a driver and the income from the store. Her goal is to continue educating her youngest child, who is four years old. She also wants to build a future for her old age, since she doesn\u2019t have a pension. She needs the loan to continue running and improving her store.\r\n\r\nArsenia R. C. D. Orozco is 58 years old and the mother of eight children, 3 of whom are still dependant on her. Her husband\u2019s income as a locksmith wasn\u2019t enough, so she decided to sell cookies, sweets, soft drinks, and sandwiches from a rented kiosk, with the goal of covering expenses for her large family. She also prepared tamales at home on the weekends, which also provided her with some small income. She quit selling for a while due to an illness of her youngest son, who has Down syndrome. She is now selling again but now she sells beer, which has been profitable so far. She wants to invest part of her loan in buying more beer and she\u2019ll use the remainder to buy a display case and glasses, because she wants to eventually open the kiosk again and continue supporting her family.\r\n\r\nLibia Orozco R. is a street vendor of fruits, soft drinks, fruit drinks, and sandwiches that she prepares at home. She puts her products in a basket and offers them to passers-by and tourists that park for a few minutes at the toll gate in Corcona before continuing their trip through central Peru. She invests part of her earnings in tuition for her oldest son, who is studying heavy equipment maintenance, and the rest in food for her children. She needs the loan to invest in her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":394921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T07:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonardo David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Grace ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arsenia Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirtha Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Olga Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Libia Crescencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1757.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939355,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1757.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780195,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1757.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669063,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1757.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064523,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-19T02:50:50Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140081,"name":"Felicidad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Felicidad S.'s journey started way back in her childhood. She learned her trade from her parents who were <i>ginamos<\/i> makers. In 1955, when she was still a teenager, she started buying fresh krill and making her own ginamos. She sold her products in nearby towns by setting up a stand in each town's market during market day. She continued her ambulatory business even after she got married and, by then, she already had a few regular customers who came to her house to buy her <i>ginamos<\/i>. \r\n<p>\r\nBecause she wanted to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 to access additional capital. She put her entire first loan into her business and she got very good returns on her investment. For the past 15 years, while she's been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has maintained her good credit standing by paying her loans on time and attending the center meetings. As her business prospered, Felicidad expanded her product lines. She now also sells <i>asin<\/i> (sea salt) and coconut wine called <i>tuba<\/i>. She earns an average monthly net income of 16,000 pesos from her business activities, and this has been a big help in defraying the family's expenses, with enough left over to pay for the education of her children in previous years. She was also able to renovate her house with her savings.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Felicidad S. is a 69-year-old married woman with six adult children ranging in age from 31 to 42 years old. She is from Brgy. Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. By sheer will and determination, she was able to send all of her children to school to earn their college degrees. All of them now have their own families and are gainfully employed. Their achievements have made Felicidad very proud and, for her, she has already attained her life's dream \u2013 according to her, all because she had NWTF-Project Dungganon for support all these years. \r\n<p>\r\nFelicidad is a businesswoman with good entrepreneurial instincts who seeks new opportunities so that she can provide her family with financial security. Now she wants to borrow 12,000 pesos for her 15th  loan cycle to use mainly as additional working capital for her ginamos business and the rest for her sea salt and coconut wine ventures.\r\n<p>\r\n<u>A little about <i>ginamos<\/i>, <i>asin<\/i> and <i>tuba<\/i>:<\/u>\r\n\"<i>Ginamos<\/i>\" is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in the Western Visayas Islands) term for anything that is salted and allowed to ferment. But when referring to other salted products, it is qualified by adding the item that was salted. For example, salted duck's eggs are called <i>ginamos nga itlog<\/i>, salted fish is called <i>ginamos nga isda<\/i>, and salted mussels are called <i>ginamos nga tahong<\/i>. When the term \"<i>ginamos<\/i>\" is used alone, it usually refers to the pasty product made from minute shrimp-like crustaceans (possibly pacific krill) that are salted, dried and pounded into a paste. <i>Ginamos<\/i> is known as \"<i>bagoong<\/i>\" in Tagalog, although some of the processing steps are a bit different and the taste is also a bit different. Negrenses pride themselves on being the makers of the best <i>ginamos<\/i> in the country, and Pulupandan is one of the towns that has the tradition and recipe handed down for several generations. <i>Ginamos<\/i> is used as a flavor enhancer in a lot of Filipino dishes, but it is also a dish in itself. It is usually cooked by adding coconut vinegar and sauteed with lots of crushed garlic and a little bit of sugar to balance the saltiness. Sometimes fried pork rind is added to make it even more special. It is usually served with green mangoes or as a side dish for <i>kare-kare<\/i>, a Filipino dish made with oxtail or beef cooked in a peanut sauce with vegetables.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Asin<\/i>, or sea salt, is made by sun drying sea water on shallow flats until the liquid evaporates and salt crystals appear. Once the salt bed is dry, the salt crystals are gathered and packed into sacks for distribution. Sea salt remains the preferred flavor enhancer in many Negrense kitchens, because many cooks contend that sea salt packs a better flavor than the fine iodized table salt sold in groceries.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Tuba<\/i>, or coconut wine, is made, not from coconut water inside the coconut, but rather by \"wounding\" the unopened flower clusters and collecting the sweet sap drops into a container. The flower clusters are usually lacerated early in the morning to get the sweeter sap, and the containers are usually gathered in the afternoon just in time for the men to arrive home from work. The slightly alcoholic beverage makes a refreshing drink after a hard day in the fields. If the <i>tuba<\/i> is not consumed within the day, it is kept in glass bottles in a cool dark place to ferment into vinegar. Like balsamic vinegar, tuba vinegar improves with age. Tuba vinegar is one of the most fragrant and flavorful vinegars in the Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

She began the business with money that her husband gave her to so that she could start her sales. She lives in the Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n neighborhood in the capital city, Managua, with her 14 year-old son, who is in school. This is her ninth loan cycle with Afodenic and she will buy construction materials such as: stone, sand, cement, steel, and others, which she will use to build a room that she will rent out, which will mean additional income that will be very useful for the family. The idea came to her because many students from other departments rent rooms when they come to the capital to complete their education. In the future she hopes to invest more in her clothing business and attract more customers. She is grateful to the institution for the loans she has received, which have been beneficial to the prosperity of her family.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. At 29 years old, she is a young entrepreneur who is proving that it is possible to break the cycle of poverty if you just give it your best shot. She started her business from nothing and now she knows that she has found the right path to achieving her hopes and dreams - to have her own fishing boat and save enough for her children's future. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore she started her business, Geraldine's husband worked as a helper at a construction site, earning the minimum daily wage, which was not nearly enough to meet the needs of their family. At the time, Geraldine was herself unemployed, and was totally dependent on her husband's take home pay, which he turned over to her so that she could budget for their expenses. That was fine while it was just them, but when she became pregnant with her first child, she realized that if she did not take the initiative, her children might grow up to be construction workers just like their father, or unemployed like her, and continue to be poor.\r\n<p>\r\nThis realization motivated her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 to access the much needed capital to start her own business.  She used her first loan to buy basic fishing equipment and went to work. At times, when her husband had no construction work, they both went fishing. The income was good and she was able to save enough to purchase a motorized boat and employ a helper. Aside from her fishing business, she was also able to start raising pigs. She earns an average monthly net income of 3,000 pesos from her ventures. Her previous loan of 7,000 pesos was used as additional capital for her business, and was paid in full on time. She is now borrowing 9,000 pesos on her eighth loan cycle from NWTF-Project Dungganon to add capital to her pig-raising business. She intends to save her earnings for the future security of her children.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":394123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additonal

It consits of the same 15 members who are in different commercial activities to earn extra income for their families.\r\n\r\nThe activities they do are:\r\nElizabeth C. \u2013 Hamburger sales\r\nGraciela L.\r\nAda O. \u2013Avon sales\r\nJuana C. - Lottery sales\r\nIrma G. \u2013Clothing sales\r\nBeatriz B. \u2013 Fruit sales\r\nIrma B. \u2013 Grocery sales\r\nDionicia F. \u2013Empanada sales\r\nSilvina C. \u2013 Clothing sales\r\nMaria F. \u2013 Fashion designer\r\nCarmen A. \u2013 Clothing sales\r\nCanuta L. \u2013Lottery sales\r\nMaria M. \u2013 Lottery sales\r\nLeopoldina Y. \u2013 Avon sales\r\nCinthia O. \u2013 Photocopiers\r\n<p>\r\nAll of these women provide an example of sacrifice. We can site, as an example, Juana C., 65 years old. She has two children that stay at home while she does her lottery sales in the morning. Later, she returns home to prepare lunch and then goes out again in the afternoon to do more lottery sales.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a hard-working woman who has a burdensome day to day life, because upon returning from work she has to do the housework, and everything she does is for the future well-being of her children as a single mother. \r\n\r\nShe has a small home made of unstable materials. In this way, she can keep up with the costs of her house and her children who go to school. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva

In her house she has display cases where she offers her customers things like needles, the most beautiful buttons for finishing clothes, and decorations for the home.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Gloria is asking the foundation for is to buy materials like clocks, picture frames, photo albums, and sewing supplies for her customers who make clothes.\r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s dream is to finish building her house because it still needs a kitchen and a dining room.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":394066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy materials for her bazar like clocks, picture frames, photo albums, and sewing supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275.69,"local_amount":275.69,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":275.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947495,"comment":null},{"amount":136.81,"local_amount":136.81,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":136.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789349,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789350,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679783,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679784,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074370,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074371,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-13T09:31:59Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140156,"name":"Bella Vista Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Perla Cristina G. de 27 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer proactiva y de mucho car\u00e1cter; coordinadora del grupo Bella Vista y la que promueve y organiza al grupo de manera tal que su record crediticio se mantenga limpio.\n\nPerla tiene familiares en Rivas, en una zona bastante \u00e1rida, ella compra frutas y verduras en Masaya, ya que esta ciudad es muy caracter\u00edstica por la agricultura y lo lleva a Rivas donde su hermana le ayuda a venderlo. \n\nSu cr\u00e9dito lo quiere para la compra de productos de temporada, con su capital propio pretende mantener la compra venta de verduras, pero con el cr\u00e9dito invertir en la compra de otros productos que se puedan llevar a esas zonas.

Her four children are still single and some of them are still studying. They are as follows: Joy-25 years old; Rica-22 years old; Danny Jr.-19 years old they are all high school graduate and the youngest is Debby-14 years old who is now a second year high school student. Juliana hopes that she could continue to support the schooling of her youngest daughter by making her business productive. \n\n\t\tJuliana said that raising chicken is quite hard especially when she doesn\u2019t have enough capital to buy for their needed feeds. Though it\u2019s hard, Juliana still continue raising her chicken because it is beneficial to them particularly the profit they get from it. Juliana would like to develop her business but her capital is insufficient that is why she is requesting a loan amounting to PHP4, 000 for her business improvement.

P. is a dedicated wife and hardworking mother who is also a businesswoman. She strives hard so that she is able to provide a good future for her two young children who are only 1 and 5 years old. Josie is 31 years old and lives in the village of Barangay Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, with her young family. Many of her friends look to her as a role model because of her determination to pursue her dreams and do her utmost to put up a small business and build it up so that she is able to help her husband in supporting and sustaining the needs of their family.\r\n\r\nBanking on her cooking skills, Josie decided to put a carinderia - a local eatery selling and serving a variety of cooked dishes. A carinderia is also sometimes called a \"turo-turo\" because the customers literally point to their choice from the array of pots containing the ready-to-eat viands. \r\n\r\nJosie joined NWTF-Project Dunganon in 2002 to access additional capital she needed to open the eatery she planned to set up adjacent to her house. From the start, she tapped the loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to continually improve her business facilities and widen her food offerings. And because she proved to be an astute businesswoman, her business generates a good income that significantly helps provide for the support of her family, with enough left over for the savings she set up for her two children.\r\n\r\nThe carinderia provides Josie with an average monthly income of PHP 9,000 which is enabling her to gradually fulfill her dreams, including saving enough to renovate and enlarge the space in her carinderia. This, so that she could have more space for the growing number of customers.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Josie borrowed PHP 17,000 to add to her capital and it was fully repaid without any delays. She is now borrowing PHP 17,500 for her 11th loan. She plans to use it again as revolving working capital so that she can purchase more meat and spices and expand the number and volume of her daily food offerings. She plans to save some of the profits so that she can invest in another productive asset that can contribute to the family income. The rest she plans to plow back into her carinderia business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":394502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

O. is shown in the picture posing with the motorcycle she intends to convert into a tricycle because, with the additional sidecar, it can shuttle more passengers in one trip than just a two-wheeled vehicle. Mercedez lives in the village of Brgy. Canggapas Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is 44 years of age and married to Romeo, who presently works as a security guard. The couple is blessed with two children: her elder, a 21-year-old daughter, now works abroad and sends money home to help the family. The younger, who is 14 years old, is in high school. Mercedez knew that she could never provide her children with a better future if the family just relied on the small salary that her husband earns as a security guard; it was not even enough to properly feed the family. So she drew on her own talents and, with complete faith that God loves her and her family and would bless her endeavors, she took the plunge and became a micro entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she started, Mercedez wasn't very ambitious. Her plan was just to open a business that could supplement, even in just a small way, her husband's income and probably improve their quality of life somehow. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 to borrow 3,000 pesos start-up capital for an electronic reloading business, selling E-load* to prepaid subscribers of mobile phone service companies.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her income improved, she opened a refreshment shop serving local <i>merienda<\/i> (snack time) fare like <i>batchoy<\/i> (a pork and noodle soup popular in the Western Visayas region), <i>pancit molo<\/i> (wanton-wrapped pork dumplings cooked in chicken broth) and other snack fare. The new venture is symbiotically compatible with her eload business as customers in one business tend to patronize the other just because they are already in her shop. The food patrons who need load for their mobile phones buy it from her instead of going to another retailer, while load buyers stay to eat her snacks. The new venture has increased her income exponentially and it has also made Mercedes realize that she actually has good business instincts. Her later loans allowed Mercedes to improve and expand her businesses, and even to buy a motorcycle, which provides her with additional income as it shuttles passengers around the town. The businesses earn a net income of 3,000 pesos per month, which helps her pay for the education of her son and also cover some of the family's daily expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nMercedez borrowed 12,000 pesos with her previous loan, and she was able to pay it back in weekly installments without any delays. She is borrowing 15,000 pesos now on her seventh loan cycle. She plans to use the money to buy a sidecar for the motorcycle to increase its income potential, and she also intends to use any money left over for the other business ventures.\r\n<p>\r\n*Eload - is a service that allows prepaid mobile phone subscribers to buy load from retailers so that they can continue using the mobile phone service when they have consumed the service credits on their cellular phones. Demand for this kind of service is high because cell phones are a must-have for most Filipinos, but the low-end market prefer the prepaid service because there are no fixed monthly charges; the availability of the cellphone service depends on the amount of load credits they purchase. Retailers get a percentage commission from the load amount they sell.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":394355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She is a young mother who comes from a hardworking family.  She lives in her own home together with her husband Linder and their two children, Densi, who is 5 years old, and Edy, who is only 1.  Gloria's greatest desire is to improve the quality of life for her children.   Her small butcher shop is located in the Las Mercedes market, the most important market in the city of Juliaca.   Her business is doing well.  She has many customers and almost every day she manages to sell what she planned.   This makes her happy, because she knows that the income will help improve her family's quality of life.   What she enjoys most about her work is the chance to talk with other vendors nearby about what's happening in the market.   Gloria has had this business for 8 years, and even though she has to work at her shop when it's intensely cold, she remains motivated and continues to work hard.   In the future, she would like to have a much larger butcher shop outside of the market, where she could generate more income.

He lives in his mother's house, and he hopes to provide her with security and peace in her old age. Humberto does tailoring and sells shoes; he and his mother own a small business, where he works hard to get ahead. At the same time, he works selling shoes that he has made. He distribues most of the shoes to other stores, but keeps the best pairs to sell in his store. \r\n\r\nWhat Humberto likes the most about his work is designing new types of shoes to sell in the market. He has done this work for 15 years and thinks the most difficult part is transporting the shoes to vendors, because the shoes are very heavy. \r\n\r\nIn the future he hopes to see his business grow so that he can sell his shoes under his own brand name. Humberto is on his third loan with MFP and is firmly committed to making his payments and being a responsible member of his community bank. With the 9,000 PEN he is requesting, he will buy better quality materials to produce new shoes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":395175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of materials to make shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-26T10:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Humberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":251.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997608,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842957,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":753.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734532,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992474,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-27T16:34:23Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140199,"name":"Lidu","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Lid\u00fa tiene 31 a\u00f1os, es una madre de familia muy alegre, vive en la casa de uno de sus familiares, junto a su esposo Juan, de 31 a\u00f1os, y su hija Antonella de 3 a\u00f1os, quienes son su principal motivaci\u00f3n para salir adelante.
