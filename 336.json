She is 23 years old, married, and has three infant-aged children. To make a living, Madel owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily need products, such as bread for snacks, candies, shampoo, sugar and sachet coffee, in the local community. Madel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Madel joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Madel is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

","en":"The Sope Serigne Babacar Sy Group is an association of businesswomen who own small stores in Thi\u00e8s, a city located 70 kilometers from Dakar. This group, named after a great Tijani marabout, was set up in 2006 by entrepreneurial women who where eager to increase their purchasing power through a <i>tontine<\/i> (a rotating savings and credit system where a group of individuals regularly contribute an agreed amount; the total amount is paid alternately to an individual member). However, after several years of successfully operating their <i>tontine<\/i>, the group members decided to join the microfinance institution UIMCEC which could grant them loans without security. Under the supervision of a loan officer of the village bank, the group was divided into subgroups of five members, each subgroup with a chairwoman and a treasurer. Right now there are 14 such subgroups. They may have the same members for many years. The Sope Serigne Babacar Sy Group meets every 20th of the month. The members of each subgroup pay their installment to their chairwoman who, with the assistance of the treasurer, is in charge of repaying the whole sum to the village bank.\r\n\r\nThe chairwoman of the subgroup Sope Serigne Babacar Sy No. 5, which applies now for its second loan, is Mrs Oumou N. and the treasurer is Mrs Ndeye Ndella T., both residents of Thi\u00e8s. Mrs N., aged 48, is married and the mother of five children. She has passionately run her store for 15 years. She sells chili pepper, shea butter and <i>n\u00e9t\u00e9tou<\/i> (a popular condiment in West Africa) at the market in Thi\u00e8s. She will use her loan to get fresh supplies from Bamako in Mali. Her earnings enable her to provide for her family's daily needs and pay the school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nThe other members of her subgroup are Mrs Ndeye Ndella T. (the treasurer) who sells fish, Mrs Ndou Gou N. who sells perfume, Mrs Ndioba G. who sells <i>bubus<\/i> (African dresses for both women and men) and cloths, and Mrs Anta M. who sells jewelry and <i>thiouraye<\/i> (a traditional mixture of grains and fragrant wood that is burnt with coal or charcoal).\r\n\r\nTo bolster their activities, they apply for a loan of 500,000 CFA francs, and each will receive a share of 100,000 CFA francs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva

Serigne Babacar Sy Group No. 10","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is an association of female commercantes (vendors) working in Thies, a city about 70 kilometres from Dakar.  The association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood.  The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.\r\n\r\nToday the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC.  Groups of five members are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount.  On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.  Currently, there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC.  Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. CoumB. Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.\r\n\r\nMs. Aissatou N. is a mother of eight and the head of group No. 10.  She has been active in her trade for over 20 years.  She sells cereals (wheat, sorghum, etc.), peanuts and vegetables in the market of Grand Thies.  She travels to villages in the region to purchase her products.  She says the small loans mean she can only buy so much per visit and so must make more frequent visits than she would like to.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Khadidiatou B., who runs a small food stand selling Senegalese dishes such as Mafi and thi\u00e9bu dieune; Awa F., who sells perfumes; Adama B., who sells bed linens and thiouraye (a Senegalese incense); and Khady N., who sells fresh vegetables.  Each group member receives 100,000 FCFA to finance their activities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":466132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To promote each member's small business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-13T14:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khadidiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168535,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007497,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036569,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759127,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790641,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971080,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708344,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922415,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188918,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T13:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50966.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484362,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T16:36:45Z","paid_date":"2010-11-18T13:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167952,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth K. is married and has two children.

They have two children who are  6 and 10 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents with the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nGeraldine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in June of 2009, in the hopes that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase the family's income by engaging in her general store business, selling food and rice. Now, she earns an average monthly income of PHP 2,800 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nGeraldine is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 4,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and food vending, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her second loan, the amount of PHP 6,000, which she intends to use to fund her general store, food vending and rice retailing business. Geraldine is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":468679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a widow who is blessed with four kids, none below 15 years of age  Being a hard working lady, she has faced so many challenges in life including being a widow at a young age, ill health and being unable to take care of her children. Due to all of these challenges, she made up her mind to become a GHAPE member in 2008. In this same year, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000FRS and the repayment was done promptly. With a loan of 150,0000FRS, she plans to buy palm oil, water fufu and eru (a popular Cameroonian dish) and cultivate a small yam farm. The loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long period of time. She has a good location for that particular business. And she has a lot of customers.\r\nHer neighbors are happy her business is right beside them, because they don't have to go to the market and they can buy from her late at night. She plans to use the profit to plough back into the business, cater for her son, and give good medical attention to herself and her son. She prefers loans from GHAPE because of the social services GHAPE offers and the comfortable repayment method. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Being a hard working lady, she has faced so many challenges in life including ill health and being unable to take care of her children. Due to all of these challenges, she made up her mind to become a GHAPE member in the year 2008.I n this same year, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000FRS, and the repayment was done promptly. \r\n         With a loan of 200,0000FRS, she plans to buy seven tins of corn, five tins of beans, 4 tins of garri, and 5 buckets of cocoyams. The loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long  time. She has a good location for her business and she has a lot of customers. Her neighbors are happy the business is located next door because they don't have to go far to the market and can buy from her late at night. She plans to use the profits to plough back into the business, cater for her son, and give good medical attention to herself and her children. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the social services GHAPE offers and the convenient method of repayment.\r\n             The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

She lives in her own home with her 54-year-old mother named Julia and her 28-year-old brother named Edgar. What she most wants is to excel in life. <p>\r\nShe owns a nice clothing and shoe stand in one of the most important shopping malls in Juliaca, where she eagerly and cheerfully sells lovely outfits to her customers. Every weekend, she travels to Tacna (in the southern part of the country) to purchase the most innovative and eye-catching designs. <p>\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is being able to advise her customers on which dress looks best on them. She has been in business for 4 years and considers the most difficult aspect of her job to be having to stay in her stand all day long without being able to go out. <p>\r\nOver time, she hopes that her business will grow and that it will yield bigger profits. <p>\r\nThis is Claudia\u2019s first loan with MFP, and she is determined make her payments on time because she would like to request more loans in the future.

Here are some details about the different activities they are involved in:\r\n\r\nMr. Carlos Antonio N. is 29 years old and lives with his parents.  He buys and sells water and firewood that he hauls in his own two-wheeled cart and horse.  He has done this for the past 10 years.  Carlos is soliciting the loan in order to buy more firewood.  The firewood in this community is used by almost all the inhabitants as the majority of people cook over a fire.  Carlos goes out to sell firewood in different locations and in isolated villages where not many people sell this type of product.\r\n\r\nVicenta I. is 60 years old and is in a common-law relationship.  She has no dependants as all her children are married.  Vicenta buys and sells firewood to her neighbors and friends.  She has done this for the past 8 years.  She is soliciting the loan in order to buy more firewood.  She needs to buy 8 cartloads of firewood now as the price will soon increase which makes it hard to make a profit.\r\n\r\nGustavo Eduardo R. is 25 years old and single.  He sells firewood.

Due to the fact that it is too difficult to take care of the family singlehandedly and that her husband could not provide for the children's basic care alone, Mary decided to joint GHAPE in 2000. She has been having many marital problems with her husband\u2019s brothers, which has made her sad all the time but she is appreciative of the fact that she is alive. Her desire is to give her children love and education. She states that she feels better each time she provides something small for her children. Mary's inability to get investment capital to generate income to meet her children\u2019s needs is what motivated her to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n.\r\nWith this loan, Mary plans to buy a two wheeled motorcycle. She knows this business will succeed because she is located at a good business site and she has a good rider for the motorcycle. In addition, Mary has saved money that she can now withdraw to purchase her bike. This is the reason that she asks for only 50,000 XAF. She plans to use the profits generated by the business to sponsor her children in school and to provide for her family's basic needs. She plans to pay her loan in 24 months. The first installment of repayment will be made on the fourth month of loan disbursement. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Con el dinero que solicita tiene pensado comprar las herramientas y materiales necesarios para reparar su motocarro y as\u00ed brindar un mejor servicio a sus exigentes pasajeros.","en":"Wilfredo is a young worker who is 28 years of age.  He lives in his own home, with his mother Teodora (age 40), his stepfather Juan (age 37), and one of his two daughters, little Ximena (age 4).\r\n<p>\r\nThis gentleman works to provide exemplary motorcycle transport services in a small town in the central jungle of Peru.  He developed his business over the past nine years, which has become profitable enough for him to build his house, furnish it, and acquire savings to secure his future and that of his family.  Unfortunately, Wilfredo says his life is not complete.  Some months ago, his girlfriend left him and took one of their daughters, whom he has not seen to this day.  He does not lose hope and is optimistic that he will get to see her soon.  Wilfredo remembers his younger daughter being disheartened, but a smile or a hug for his little Ximena makes her feel better.  He knows that he must continue to struggle on her behalf.  In the future, Wilfredo has plans to buy land, continue saving money, and open a bookstore and fast food restaurant.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.  Wilfredo promises to continue making his payments on time.  He enjoys working with his Communal Bank because the members are very active and have become like family.  With the money he requested, Wilfredo will purchase tools and materials needed to repair his motorcycle taxi so that he can provide better service to his demanding customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":469015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repairs to his motorcycle taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T02:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124439,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960180,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":253.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993024,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717810,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751485,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933952,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:04:56Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":168149,"name":"Anselma Josefina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Anselma es socia del Banco Comunal Alegr\u00eda Huamanga.\nAnselma es casada, tiene 61 a\u00f1os y 5 hijos, Anselma venD. frutas en el mercado central D. la ciudad D. manera ambulatoria, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas.

He has little time to spend on this type of activity. His products sell because many people who travel need this type of merchandise. He is asking for the loan to purchase more merchandise wholesale and thus have more profit. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":469044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"The purchase of toothpaste, toothbrushes, creams, razors, soap.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Christina has 5 years of experience in this business.  Christina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Christina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Christina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Christina P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Asoleaga needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 255 tala or US $106 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Asoleaga joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Asoleaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Asoleaga I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.55 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.64 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Nele  has many years of experience in this business.  Nele  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 125 tala or US $52 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nele  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Nele 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nele  S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling general handicrafts and elei materials to tourists and local community members.  Terisa has 5 years of experience in this business.  Terisa needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 215 tala or US $90 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Terisa joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Terisa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Terisa T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Salemalama has 4 years of experience in this business.  Salemalama needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Salemalama joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Salemalama's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Salemalama P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.54 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.55 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 58 and married with 6 children (ages 10 - 24).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Lima has 7 years of experience in this business.  Lima needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 255 tala or US $106 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lima joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lima's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lima A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

E. is 25 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Moevao has 6 years of experience in this business.  Moevao needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 355 tala or US $148 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Moevao joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Moevao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Moevao E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.25 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.45 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 21 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Tineimu has 6 years of experience in this business.  Tineimu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tineimu joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tineimu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tineimu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 63 and married with 6 children (ages 22- 35 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Masele has many years of experience in this business.  Masele needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Masele joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Masele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Masele T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.55 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.89 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 T. is 47 and married with 5 children (ages 11 - 21 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ruta  has many years of experience in this business.  Ruta  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 285 tala or US $119 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ruta  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ruta 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ruta  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 35 and married with 5 children (ages 7 - 13 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lote has many years of experience in this business.  Lote needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lote joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lote's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lote F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 53 and married with 7 children (ages 15 - 27 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Eseta has many years of experience in this business.  Eseta needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 230 tala or US $96 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eseta joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Eseta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eseta F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.01 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 20 and married with 2 children (ages 4 and 8).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mainifo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Mainifo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mainifo joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mainifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mainifo T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faatatau has many years of experience in this business.  Faatatau needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 110 tala or US $46 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faatatau joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faatatau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faatatau V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 34 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture,which is poultry.  Siua has 4 years of experience in this business.  Siua needs a loan of WST $750.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 160 tala or US $67 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Siua joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Siua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siua L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.22 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 41 and married with 3 children (ages 6 - 22 years).  She owns a business venture, selling general handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Foafoaga has many years of experience in this business.  Foafoaga needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 130 tala or US $54 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Foafoaga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Foafoaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Foafoaga P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.35 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.87 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarilou is married and has 2 school-aged children. Marilou owns and operates a retail business. The main source of income for the business comes from selling fruits and vegetables. Marilou has been involved in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marilou joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilou is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase more products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house and to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

SPBD's loans are Foini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Foini S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Vaivao has 4 years of experience in this business.  Vaivao needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 110 tala or US $46 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaivao joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vaivao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaivao T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 53 and married with 3 children (ages 14 - 31years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sasa has many years of experience in this business.  Sasa needs a loan of WST $300 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tA. or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sasa joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sasa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sasa A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 73 and married with 7 children (ages 16 - 34years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Tenisi has 5 years of experience in this business.  Tenisi needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tenisi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tenisi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tenisi A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 27 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 5years).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Asufaaniutu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 25 tala or US $10 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Asufaaniutu joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Asufaaniutu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Asufaaniutu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 24 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 6years).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Taupou needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 69 tala or US $29 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Taupou joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Taupou's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Taupou P. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.89 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is from the village of Caputol. She is thirty-eight years old. Juvita is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Juvita owns and operates a \"habal-habal\" (motorcycle-for-hire) business venture in the services sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing motorcycle transport services to local community members. Juvita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Juvita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juvita has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Juvita is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide better service to her customers. This loan will be the eighth loan Juvita has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional income generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mrs. Phal M. is a farmer who owns a piece of land for growing rice to make a living. Her husband, Mr. Sok San, is a construction laborer. In the rice plantation, Mrs. Phal M. has a problem because she does not have enough money to hire laborers to harvest her rice. Thus, Mrs. Phal M. decided to apply for a loan so she can hire laborers to harvest the rice field.

A. is 32 and married with 4 children (ages 8 - 22years).  She owns a business venture, catching large fish.  Fonofaavae has 3 years of experience in this business.  Fonofaavae needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing boat and a fishing net.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fonofaavae joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fonofaavae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fonofaavae A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Mersulita is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Mersulita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

M. is 39 and married with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Peresia has 4 years of experience in this business.  Peresia needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 155 tala or US $65 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Peresia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Peresia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Peresia M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is from the village of Caputol.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling flowers in the local community. Merlyn is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Merlyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. Merlyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourteenth loan taken out by Merlyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is 60 and married with 6 children (ages 19 - 35 years).  She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Nafanua has many years of experience in this business.  Nafanua needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 1050 tala or US $438 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nafanua joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Nafanua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nafanua B. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 32 and married with 3 children (ages 15 - 24years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Peia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Peia needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Peia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Peia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Peia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 30 and married with 2 children (ages 5 - 7years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Aneta has many years of experience in this business.  Aneta needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aneta joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Aneta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Aneta T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

U. is 24 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Toe has many years of experience in this business.  Toe needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 155 tala or US $65 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Toe joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Toe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Toe U. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Momoe has 3 years of experience in this business.  Momoe needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Momoe joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Momoe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Momoe S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2.12 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.52 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

J. is from the village of Catarman, Camiguin Province. She is thirty-three years old. Rona is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Rona owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Rona has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rona joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rona is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan Rona has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is 22 and married with 2 children (ages 6 and 11).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Feri has 4 years of experience in this business.  Feri needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 230 tala or US $96 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Feri joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Feri's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Feri L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.23 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 29 and married with 1 child (2 months old).  She owns a business venture, selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Liua has many years of experience in this business.  Liua needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 85 tala or US $35 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liua joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Liua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Liua T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

G. is 50 and married with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Siane has 5 years of experience in this business.  Siane needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Siane joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Siane's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siane G. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.23 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 25 and married with 2 children (ages 3-months and 5 years).  She owns a business venture, selling general handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Limasene has 6 years of experience in this business.  Limasene needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 180 tala or US $75 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Limasene joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Limasene's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Limasene S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.35 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Kemeta has many years of experience in this business.  Kemeta needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 220 tala or US $92 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Kemeta joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Kemeta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Kemeta N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.55 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

N. is 38 and married with 1 child (8-months-old).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Uliuli has 5 years of experience in this business.  Uliuli needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 85 tala or US $35 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Uliuli joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Uliuli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Uliuli N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

O. is 42 and married with 8 children (ages 11 - 20 years).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Vivione has many years of experience in this business.  Vivione needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 215 tala or US $90 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vivione joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vivione's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vivione O. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 20 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, raising cattle for sale.  Ieni has many years of experience in this business.  Ieni needs a loan of WST $1500 to expand shelter for the borrower's livestock.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 tala or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ieni joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ieni's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ieni P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Inosia has 5 years of experience in this business.  Inosia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Inosia joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Inosia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Inosia P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Kuch K., 28, is a local rice cultivator who has been farming on her own land for many years. In addition, she raises a few chickens in a stall at her home. She is married to Som Nang, age 37, who assists her in the business.

G. is from the village of Tuburan Aloran, Misamis Occidental.

She sells specialty hand-woven products called \"nipa hut\" (products woven from the leaves of the Nipa palm) in the local community. Presentation has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $25 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Presentation joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Presentation has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from GDMPC. She is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for additional capital. This will be her 7th loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to broaden her efforts.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Debuloc, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. She is 27 years old. Rodura is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Rodura raises pigs for sale. Rodura has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $200 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rodura joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Rodura is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be her first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Tuburan Aloran, Misamis Occidental.

To make a living, Julia owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling a variety of products like mosquito killer, soap for laundry and other daily use products in the local community. Julia has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately $89 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Julia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Julia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Julia is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her efforts.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is forty-eight years old and lives in the city of Balykchi together with her family.  Balykchi is one of those cities previously considered to be one of the growing cities; however, due to the breakup of the USSR, it began to lose its potential and became a \u201cdead\u201d city over the course of fifteen years.

The oldest daughter is thirty-three years old.  The second daughter is twenty-nine.  The third daughter is twenty-six, and the youngest son is twenty-two years old.  Democratic principles have governed Burma\u2019s family for a long time, i.e. Burma and her husband gave their children the freedom to choose their career and future, having previously given them good upbringing and education.  Oldest daughters left to work in Bishkek.  The son is currently attending a university.  The oldest daughter became a designer.  The second daughter followed her father\u2019s footsteps and became a teacher.  The third daughter is temporarily unemployed.  Meanwhile, Burma stayed at home to take care of the household.  Her husband and she have been setting money aside for many years and were able to buy a cow.  Since then, Burma has been involved in animal husbandry and selling milk.  Burma earns three thousand som ($60) in one month.  Burma decided to request a loan in order to purchase and keep one more bull.  Burma is now worried about her daughters.  She hopes to marry them off, build a new house and barn for the livestock next to her home.\r\n <p>\r\nBurma has three partners in this group:\r\n<p>\r\nLazzat T. is twenty-eight years old.

She takes care of the household, breeds livestock and sells milk.  Saliyka\u2019s husband works at the village administrative office as a land inspector.  Saliyka has four children.

Guljan and her family live in the city of Karabalta.  Her husband is a construction worker, and Guljan decided to stay home and become involved in the household business.  She wanted to give good upbringing to her four children and completely surround them with her care.  When her children grew up, Guljan still preferred to continue breeding livestock, instead of finding other work.  She got used to the animal husbandry business, and, after all, this business earned a good income all these years and allowed her to raise the children, provide them with an education and build a house.  The children have grown to be well-brought up and hard-working.  All of them used to help Guljan take care of the livestock.  However, because the city has been experiencing a difficult economic situation, lack of manufacturing and unemployment, the children were forced to leave the parents\u2019 home and go work in Russia.  Guljan also had to find additional sources of income.  Finally, she started to sew traditional items at home.  Now Guljan needs a loan in order to purchase fabrics.  She wants to make a gift for her son and buy him a house.\r\n<p>\r\nGuljan has three partners in this group:\r\n<p>\r\nSaipil is fifty-two years old.  His wife sews traditional items.  Saipil is involved in a household business; he breeds livestock and sells milk.  He is a father of five children.  Saipil started his animal husbandry business by using his own savings to purchase a calf.  Now he needs a loan to purchase another calf.  Saipil wants to save enough money to repair his house and barn.\r\n<p>\r\nIrida is thirty-eight years old.  Her husband works at a construction site.  Irida stays at home and is involved in animal husbandry and milk sales.  She has three children.  Her oldest daughter works at a candy factory, the son goes to school, and the youngest daughter is a preschooler.  Irida hopes to obtain this loan and purchase a calf.  She wants to save enough money to repair her house and marry off her son.\r\n<p>\r\nGulsina is twenty-two years old.  She has two children.  The daughter is three years old, and the youngest is only one month old.  Gulsina\u2019s husband is involved in livestock breeding and sales, and selling milk.  Prior to childbirth, Gulsina used to help her husband.  Together, they built a two-room temporary home.  Gulsina hopes to obtain a loan and buy livestock to raise and sell.  She dreams of owning her own home.  She wants to save faster, invest the money into a home purchase and move out of her parents\u2019 house.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva
