Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":155624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more stock of boutique in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-29T12:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-13T19:42:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-06-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":61400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":237373,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-07-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":61400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":266216,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-08-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":61400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":295213,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-09-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":61400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":325840,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":61400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":358665,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-04-29T19:42:59Z","paid_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":47130,"name":"Virinia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virina is a single mother of three sons, the oldest one is 28, the other 22, and the youngest one 18 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nVirina used to work as a housekeeper.

Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women, as members of a Committee, the energy and motivation to reach success.<p> \r\n\r\nIn a neighborhood called Villa Bonita, located in Villa Elisa, the neighbors set up a meeting and discussed the idea of forming a Committee to lift themselves out of poverty. Motivated by the desire to change their situation, they started analyzing different business opportunities which they considered profitable. That is how the Committee \u201cMujeres Trabajadoras\u201d was born. The members have good professional and personal relationships. They are not only partners but also friends.

B., currently I am in the business of selling typical clothing in the village of Cruz Blanca of San Juan Sacatepequez where I live.  It has been approximately four years since I came into the business of selling clothing.  At first I helped a woman sell her merchandise on commission.  At that time I worked at a vegetable packing plant and, since I had already acquired experience selling clothing, I started to invest part of my salary in selling sweaters.  Thereafter, I got married and had a daughter so I dedicated myself completely to the business which is why I saw the need to invest more capital in the business.  I now also sell local clothing such as guipiles, shirts, shawls, girdles and other products which my clients might request such as sandals.  Since I now have a fixed clientele, I deliver the clothing to my customers' homes or they stop by my home to make their purchases.  What I want to accomplish is to be able to invest more capital and to put a stall in San Juan Sacatepequz.  However, this requires a lot of capital which is why I want to increase my clientele to obtain this capital.  This will allow me to take advantage of the important upcoming holidays. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Translated from Spanish by Cindy M., Kiva Volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoy Carmen Beatriz C. B., actualmente mi negocio es vender ropa t\u00edpica en la aldea Cruz Blanca de San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez, es donde yo vivo. \r\nHace aproximadamente  cuatro a\u00f1os que inicie en el negocio de la venta de ropa, pero primero yo \u00fanicamente le ayudaba a una se\u00f1ora a vender su mercader\u00eda y ella me pagaba una comisi\u00f3n, en ese entonces yo tenia un trabajo en una empacadora de verduras y con el salario que tenia, como yo ya hab\u00eda adquirido experiencia en la venta de ropa empec\u00e9 a invertir parte de mi salario para vender su\u00e9teres, pero despu\u00e9s que me case y que tengo ya una nena, me dediqu\u00e9 totalmente al negocio, por eso vi la necesidad de invertir m\u00e1s capital ya que, ahora vendo cortes t\u00edpicos, g\u00fcipiles, blusas, rebozos, fajas, y alguna otra cosa que mis clientas me van solicitando, como sandalias.  Como ya cuento con clientes fijos, la ropa la entrego en las casas de ellas o ellas llegan  a mi casa para comprar, pero lo que quiero lograr es poder invertir m\u00e1s capital y poder poner un local en San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez, pero eso requiere de mucho capital, por lo que quiero primero ganar m\u00e1s clientes obtener ese capital que necesito y aprovechar las fechas importantes m\u00e1s pr\u00f3ximas para vender y que en un plazo no muy largo pueda poner mi local."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":155727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase

Llego a trabajar en un colegio como profesora por un par de a\u00f1os, le iba bien pero tambi\u00e9n deb\u00eda ocuparse de su casa y de sus hijos. Es as\u00ed que se le ocurri\u00f3 poner una guarder\u00eda en su propia vivienda ya que le gustaban los ni\u00f1os. Ah\u00ed ella cuida de ni\u00f1os desde tres a\u00f1os hasta diez a\u00f1os de edad. Actualmente lleva cinco a\u00f1os ofreciendo este servicio de lunes a s\u00e1bado.  <p>\r\nLa meta que persigue Blanca es  ver a sus hijos terminar sus estudios escolares y universitarios. Ellos por su parte le han prometido que cuando ellos crezcan y tengan un buen trabajo ella no tendr\u00e1 la necesidad de  trabajar m\u00e1s.

services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVilla Florida\u201d is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea-level, in the community of Huanchos, in the district of Paucarbamba, province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are the growing of corn, potatoes and wheat, and also raising cows, bulls and sheep. In the small town the population have some shops and proviD. several services. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank has initiated its fourth loan cycle with 15 female borrowers and a total loan of 6,200 soles (about 2,225 US$). The loans range from 200, 400, 600, and up to 1,200 soles. The group already is in its fourth loan cycle, with one and half years of existence, and is one of the \u201coldest\u201d community banks is the Wari project. In the time with FINCA Peru the members have learned to save, be more responsible with money and in their business. They have learned to be punctual and to respect each other. The dream for all is to make their business grow and to have a higher income in future.  Most of the members use their loans for buying school supplies for the children or to increase merchandise for their business.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Sonilda Trist\u00e1n T.. Sonilda has a small shop where she sells marmalades and sweets with she buys in Huancayo. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more things for her business.  Over time, with FINCA Per\u00fa she was able to save over 500 soles, which she used took out to buy herself a refrigerator. And her future savings she will use for making her house a little more comfortable and buying a television.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnother story tells of Flor Edith V. Trist\u00e1n, a mother of 2 children: one of 6 years, the other 3 years old. She has her business of raising small animals like pigs, chickens and guinea-pigs. And in her small shop, she sells cheese that she buys from local producers. With her 400 soles loan she will buy more animals. When asked about her savings she tells us that she uses them for buying clothes for her children. Her dream for the future is to buy a car and to move to a bigger city, like Huancayo or the country\u2019s capital of Lima, where it will be more easy to run a business because there is more economical movement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":155805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy new supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-05-05T19:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constanza Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rudy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mariluz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fortunita Segundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-20T09:39:42Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6200,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":370.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":371,"local_amount":1033.8,"processed_date":"2008-06-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244151,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":371,"local_amount":1033.8,"processed_date":"2008-07-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":272501,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":371,"local_amount":1033.8,"processed_date":"2008-08-20T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301777,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":371,"local_amount":1033.8,"processed_date":"2008-09-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332537,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":371,"local_amount":1033.8,"processed_date":"2008-10-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":366644,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":370,"local_amount":1031,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314339,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-05-06T09:39:42Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T03:48:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":47222,"name":"Lucila","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Before having her own shop, Lucila started out working for a textile company.

She buys pigs from the surrounding villages, and then cooks, and sells delicious pork dishes. The pork is usually breaded with a casava-based flour, and prepared with sauce. With her first loan, which she has fully repaid, she was able to move locations to be closer to the Ago\u00e8 marketplace, as well as improve her recipes.

As soon as he retired he learned about the field and techniques of carpentry from a relative. He soon realized that he enjoyed it so much that he became more of an expert than his teacher. And as a result her started up his own carpentry business. He knew little but enough to grow and design another business project. For eighteen years, when he had enough money he bought an area of land close to his home and opened a parking lot to rent. He now has basically taken over this business, whilst his oldest son, a carpenter also, is in charge of the carpentry business. Today, he lives with his second wife and youngest child, who is eighteen years old. His plan is to build more rooms in the house to rent so that they can live off this money in the future.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cDios es Amor\u201d is located at approximately 4,000 meters above sea-level, in the community of Pilpichaca, in the district with the same name, province of Huaytar\u00e1. The main activities of the population are growing potatoes and wheat at lower altitudes, and raising sheep and alpaca in the higher areas. The area is known for alpacas and their wool production. Because of the high altituD., the area is not very suitable for agriculture, but the natural grass (pasture) makes it very favorable for raising alpacas and sheep. In the small town of Pilpichaca, on the main road from Huancavelica to the \u201cV\u00eda Libertadores\u201d highway that connects Ayacucho with the coast and Peru\u00b4s capital, L., there are some shops and some produce cheese, but alpaca wool and meat production is the main activity.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 19 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,400 soles (about 1,575 US$). Most of the loans are of 200 soles, with three exceptions of loans of 400 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save, except for the initial loan to start. But all agree to save in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Lourdes C. C.. Lourdes has a small grocery store where she also sells sweets. Her 200 soles loan she will use to fill up her small store again. During the breaks at the local school, she also sells sweets at the entrance of the school. In the future she hopes to be able to buy a house in a bigger city and run a business there. And like most women, she wants her children to be professionals when they leave college. In the shorter run she will be saving for her children\u2019s education and to increase her business. Now that she has entered in FINCA Peru, she wants to learn how to work more enthusiastically and responsibly and how to save.\r\n<p>\r\nVictoria S. D. S. has her business of selling clothes at local weekly or biweekly markets. Other business she runs are buying and selling of cheese, trout and sheep. With her 200 soles loan she will buy new merchandise to go to the markets. Her dream for the future is to have a small restaurant and to grow little by little. Victoria will save for the education of her children and for her future restaurant. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more. A neighbor, a member of FINCA in the city of Ayacucho, told her a lot about FINCA, especially about the savings, and maD. Victoria very interested. Besides that , she will work more responsibly and receive trainings like practicing values and how to care for herself."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":155936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy new supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-05-06T02:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Georgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Teresa Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Idelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Madgalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Imna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maceda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oilivia Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-20T23:02:54Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4400,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":733.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":263,"local_amount":734.73,"processed_date":"2008-06-21T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":736.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244965,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":734.73,"processed_date":"2008-07-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":736.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":273381,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":734.73,"processed_date":"2008-08-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":736.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302776,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":734.73,"processed_date":"2008-09-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":736.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":333570,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":263,"local_amount":734.73,"processed_date":"2008-10-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-22T07:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":736.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":367803,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":260,"local_amount":726.35,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":728,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314340,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-05-06T23:02:54Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T03:48:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":47272,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Eva began selling natural medicines to end the economic hardships of her home.

The people of Santiago of Atitlan are very traditional.  They preserve their culture even today.  As can be seen in the photo, the women dress with the typical suit of the area that consists of a blouse or embroidered dress, a short or long skirt, a  cinch or strap and a perraje or scarf.  In many towns the tradition is no longer seen so well preserved as in Santiago.  \r\n\r\n<P>Another interesting aspect of the town where these women live is that some years ago the population was harshly affected by Hurricane Stan.  On that occasion, due to the storm, the town was cut off; the roadways were completely closed and the people went for a long time without access to drinking water and fresh food.  \r\n\r\n<P>Santiago of Atitlan is a town touched by the art.  There are many jewelers, weavers, designers and painters at present living in this area.  Inside the \u201cWorkers\u201d group all the associates work with weavings.  Half of the group works weaving embroidered dresses in looms that are tied at one end to their waist.  The waist loom technique has passed down from generation to generation.  The majority of women begin to learn to weave before the age of ten years approximately.    \r\n\r\n<P>The other half of the group do embroidery.  As can be seen in the photo they make designs of flowers and birds.  The time that it takes a woman to embroider an embroidered dress depends exclusively on the work.  For example, an embroidered dress that is completely embroidered such as that of the third lady from the left can take three months, while an embroidered dress that is not embroidered entirely like that of the first lady on the right can take an artisan from three to four weeks.  The profits can vary from 15 dollars to fifty dollars, depending on the embroidered dress.  \r\n\r\n<P>Competition is very tough in Santiago due to the high number of artisans, nevertheless these women can do well.  The loan is a very useful tool that they can utilize to invest in their business and to make it more profitable since they can buy the thread wholesale or hire labor.  If we support them, we are going to give them the opportunity to be noticed and to do well.  Support them!  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las integrantes del banco comunal Trabajadoras son oriundas del pueblo Santiago de Atitlan. La gente de Santiago de Atitlan es muy tradicional, ellos hasta el d\u00eda de hoy preservan su cultura. Como se puede ver en la foto, las mujeres est\u00e1n vestidas con el traje t\u00edpico del \u00e1rea que consiste en la blusa o huipil, corte o falda larga, cincho o correa y un perraje o bufanda. En muchos pueblos ya no se ve la tradici\u00f3n tan preservada como en Santiago. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro aspecto interesante del pueblo donde habitan estas mujeres es que hace unos a\u00f1os la poblaci\u00f3n fue duramente afectada por la tormenta Stan. En dicha ocasi\u00f3n, debido a la tormenta el pueblo estuvo aislado, las vias de tr\u00e1nsito estaban completamente clausuradas y la gente estuvo por mucho tiempo sin acceso a agua potable y a comida fresca. \r\n\r\n<P>Santiago de Atitlan es un pueblo tocado por el arte. Hay muchos joyeros, tejedores, dise\u00f1adores y pintores actualmente viviendo en esta \u00e1rea. Dentro del grupo las Trabajadoras todas las clientas trabajan con tejidos. La mitad del grupo trabaja tejiendo huipiles en telares de cintura. La t\u00e9cnica de telar de cintura se ha pasado de generaci\u00f3n en generaci\u00f3n. La mayor\u00eda de mujeres empiezan ha aprender a tejer antes de los diez a\u00f1os aproximadamente. \r\n\r\n<P>La otra mitad del grupo son bordadoras. Como se puede ver en la foto ellas tienden a bordar flores y aves. El tiempo que toma una mujer en bordar un huipil depende exclusivamente del trabajo. Por ejemplo, un huipil que est\u00e1 completamente bordado como el de la tercera se\u00f1ora contando desde la izquierda puede demorar hasta tres meses, mientras que un huipil que no est\u00e1 bordado enteramente como el de la primera se\u00f1ora contando desde la derecha puede tomarle a una artesana de tres a cuatro semanas. Las ganancias pueden variar entre 15 d\u00f3lares a cincuenta d\u00f3lares, dependiendo del huipil. \r\n\r\n<P>La competencia es muy dura en Santiago debido al alto n\u00famero de artesanas, sin embargo estas mujeres pueden salir adelante. El cr\u00e9dito es una herramienta muy \u00fatil que ellas pueden utilizar para invertir en su negocio y hacerlo m\u00e1s rentable ya que pueden comprar el hilo por mayor o contratar mano de obra. Si nosotros las apoyamos vamos a darles la oportunidad a destacarse y salir adelante.

It is difficult to conceive the idea that women that have been so marginalized from the social, economic, and political system of the country have access to a service as modern as credit.  In their town they heard about a lady called America that works on a project in which they give fast loans with dependable and low interest.  That \"lady\" is America Chiyal, a loan agent that works for Friendship Bridge.  The women that make up the group joined to form the communal bank and once they had formed said unit they contacted America.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Parromeras contacted the institution because they need a loan to enlarge the amount of capital for their business.  Half of the group is going to invest their loan in the breeding and sale of chickens.  Some are going to buy chickens already grown to feed for some weeks and then sell.  Others are going to buy the chickens already grown to cut up and sell in the market, while others are going to buy the chickens already cut up and plucked to sell in the market.  Juana Martinez says that she not only plans to invest her loan in the breeding of chickens, but she also plans to buy piglets to grow fat and then sell in the market, and finally she also embroiders typical blouses.  One is surprised by the versatility of many of these women.  \r\n\r\n<P>The other half of the group is divided into 3 parts.  Three women sell vegetables in the market.  They will invest their loan in the purchase of carrots, huisquil (a type of squash), cabbage, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and avocado, among other vegetables.  Two women work with a foot loom to make short and long traditional skirts.   Usually, only men work in the looms owing to the force required to work the loom.  The last group works embroidering traditional blouses of their towns.  \r\n\r\n<P>The dream of the women of Parromero is to grow their business so that they do not have to depend on debt to have a profitable business and so that they can generate sufficient income to invest in their business and to cover the needs of their families.  Inside this communal bank there are many women with the drive of Juana Martinez, nevertheless many of these women battle alone.  That is why, if we give them a hand, they are going to feel that they are not alone in their fight against poverty.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>San Jose Chacaya es una comunidad retirada en el altiplano de Guatemala.

Ellas escucharon en su pueblo sobre una \u201cse\u00f1ora\u201d llamada Am\u00e9rica que trabaja en un proyecto en el cual dan cr\u00e9ditos r\u00e1pidos, con intereses bajos y confiables. Esa \u201csenora\u201d es America Chiyal, una agente de cr\u00e9dito que trabaja para Friendship Bridge. Las mujeres que integran el grupo se juntaron para formar el banco comunal y una vez conformado dicha unidad contactaron a America. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Parromeras contactaron la instituci\u00f3n porque necesitan un cr\u00e9dito para aumentar el tama\u00f1o del capital de su negocio. La mitad del grupo va a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en la crianza y venta de pollos. Algunas van a comprar pollos ya crecidos para alimentarlos por unas semanas y luego venderlos. Otras van a comprar los pollos ya crecidos para destazarlos y venderlos en el mercado, mientras que otras van a comprar los pollos ya destazados y desplumados para venderlos en el mercado. Juana Martinez dice que ella no solo invierte su cr\u00e9dito en la crianza de pollos, sino que ella tambi\u00e9n a comprado sus cerditos para engordarlos y luego venderlos en el mercado, finalmente ella tambi\u00e9n borda blusas t\u00edpicas. Uno se sorprende de la versatilidad de muchas de estas mujeres. \r\n\r\n<P>La otra mitad del grupo se divide en tres mujeres que venden verduras en el mercado y que invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de zanahoria, huisquil, repollo, cebollas, tomates, lechuga, aguacate, entre otras verduras. Luego, dos mujeres trabajan en telar de pies. Ellas elaboran cortes, faldas largas tradicionales. Usualmente, solo los hombres trabajan en los telares debido a la fuerza requerida para emplear el telar. Mientras que el resto trabaja bordando blusas tradicionales de sus pueblos. \r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de las mujeres Parromero es el de agrandar su negocio para que as\u00ed no tengan que depender de una deuda para tener un negocio rentable y para que puedan generar las suficientes utilidades para que puedan invertir en su negocio y cubrir las necesidades de sus familias. Dentro de este banco comunal hay muchas mujeres con el empuje de Juana Martinez, sin embargo muchas de estas mujeres se encuentran batallando solas, es por eso que si nosotros les demos un empuje, ellas se van a sentir acompa\u00f1adas en su lucha contra la

of Atitl\u00e1n.  These women reflect at first sight a confidence that calls your attention, so that while conducting the interview I was discovering the reason for this confidence.  \r\n\r\n<P>The great majority are artisans and they work making necklaces of jewels.  They produce beautiful earrings, bracelets, and necklaces with pearlites imported from the Czech Republic.  Some say that this art of making necklaces was imported to lake Atitl\u00e1n by European artisans several decades ago.  There are also women who invest their capital in small convenience stores and knitting machines.  They buy thread to create beautiful Guatemalan embroidered dresses and traditional blouses.  \r\n\r\n<P>When the artisans begin to share how they are going to invest their loans one can realize the dimension of their businesses.  The jewelers revealed that with the loan that they are going to receive they were going to buy the materials for the necklaces by the kilogram, while the great majority of artisans buy the materials for necklaces by the ounce.  This reflects that they are in a little more advanced phase of business development, since the quantity of commodity that they are going to buy is a lot greater than that of the majority of artisans around la Laguna.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Jorge\u00f1itas have been working with Friendship Bridge for more than a year and they have benefited from the training given by the loan agents.  The women commented that they were interested a lot in the themes of saving money, natural medicine and especially family planning.  They mentioned what a large impact it had on them to know that a woman is able and has the authority to plan the size of her family.  \r\n\r\n<P>Also they mentioned that they like to work with microfinance institutions, especially with Friendship Bridge, because they ask few requirements, the disbursements are fast and they help them with their business.  If you contribute to the success of these artisans then they are going to be able to continue developing their qualities as businesswomen and artisans.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Jorge\u00f1itas provienen del bello pueblo de San Jorge la Laguna.

Her problem was that she did not know what to sell or what to produce that would be profitable.  So that she decided to learn a method of making leather sandals.  At present, she has already run her business for two and a half years,  working from orders that she receives from people or from some stores.

Rojas Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<P>Behind the look of a group of timid women one never knows what experiences can be found and in this case business initiatives also.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Red Roses group explained to me something that I would never have been able to contemplate and that is that, without an infusion of capital, they would not be able to create their own separate business.  Without the loan they would continue being employees of someone else, earning a minimum wage which would not give them enough to either begin a career or leave poverty.  \r\n\r\n<P>Nevertheless, the adult women told me that at the moment of receiving a loan they are touched, but at the same time they feel a little fear because they do not know if they are going to be able repay the debt.  It is a very understandable feeling since is a new experience through which they and all the women of their generation are passing.  In spite of that, they have already completed five loans with Friendship Bridge.  \r\n\r\n<P>A detail that leaps to light was that the majority of members of this group worked selling second-hand items.  Four clients commented that they went to the city of Guatemala, a trip of approximately four hours, to buy second-hand items in order to sell them in Suchitepequez which is a regional capital that is located to another four hours from the town of Nahuala.  The interesting thing about these trips is that the women travel to completely different destinations and therefore compete with people from other cultures that are not theirs.  This is something really impressive since traditionally the women are confined inside a native community and do not tend to travel a lot.  Another detail that reflects a modernist cut of this group is that ten women among the youths and adults have just bought cell phones.  \r\n\r\n<P>Two clients will invest their credit in wood to work in carpentry.  Two others have a bakery.  Others sell and weave clothes.  As can be seen in this group one can find a variety of important businesses.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Red Roses is a group of women that is exploring different roads, so that in some way they can avoid being faced with the saturation of the market by opting for businesses that have not been explored by the remainder of women in their communities.  Supporting a group of creative and innovative women is important to promote the development of micro-business and of Guatemala.  Thanks for your consideration.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Detr\u00e1s la mirada de un grupo de mujeres t\u00edmidas uno nunca sabe que experiencias puede extraer de ellas y en este caso iniciativas empresariales tambi\u00e9n. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Rosas Rojas me explicaron algo que nunca hubiera podido contemplar y eso es que sin infusi\u00f3n de capital, su negocio no podr\u00eda despegar. Sin el cr\u00e9dito ellas seguir\u00edan siendo empleadas de alguien m\u00e1s ganando una cantidad m\u00ednima la cual no las dejar\u00eda ni empezar la carrera de salir de la pobreza. \r\n\r\n<P>Sin embargo, las mujeres adultas me comentaron que a la hora de sacar un cr\u00e9dito ellas se emocionan, pero a la vez sienten un poco de temor porque no van a saber si van a poder repagar la deuda. Es un sentimiento muy entendible ya que es una experiencia nueva por las cuales ellas y todas las mujeres de su generaci\u00f3n est\u00e1n pasando. A pesar de eso, ya llevaban con Friendship Bridge cinco cr\u00e9ditos. \r\n\r\n<P>Un detalle que salto a luz fue que la mayor\u00eda de integrantes de este grupo trabajaban vendiendo trastes. Cuatro clientas comentaron que se iban a la ciudad de Guatemala un viaje de aproximadamente cuatro horas a comprar trastes para luego irlos a vender hasta Suchitepequez la cual es una cabecera departamental que est\u00e1 ubicada a otras cuatro horas del pueblo de Nahuala. Lo interesante de estos viajes es que las mujeres viajan a destinos completamente distintos y por ende lidiando con gente de otras culturas que no son las suyas. Algo realmente impresionante ya que tradicionalmente las mujeres dentro de una comunidad ind\u00edgena est\u00e1n confinadas y no tienden a viajar mucho. Otro detalle que refleja un corte vanguardista de este grupo es que diez mujeres entre j\u00f3venes y adultas acaban de comprar celulares. \r\n\r\n<P>Dos clientas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en madera para trabajar en carpinter\u00eda. Otras dos tienen un panader\u00eda, otras venden y tejen ropa. Como se puede ver en este grupo uno puede encontrar una variedad de negocios importante. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Rojas Rosas es un grupo de mujeres que est\u00e1 explorando distintos caminos, que de alguna manera est\u00e1n evitando enfrentarse a la saturaci\u00f3n de mercado al optar por negocios no muy explorado por el resto de mujeres en sus comunidades. Apoyar a un grupo de mujeres innovadoras y creativas es importante para promover el desarrollo de la microempresa y de Guatemala.

In my case, I observed a cheerful environment that involved such riotous laughter at one point that we had to pause briefly before continuing with my interview!  This resulted when I asked for a show of hands from those women present who raised farm animals.  The translator told them to raise their hands if they were animals. <p>\r\n\r\nThe Uk\u00b4Ux Kem ladies are unequalled in their sense of joy, which is reflected in the manner in which they work and use their credit.  It appears all the group members feel a loan helps them better themselves business-wise, given that this increases their working capital and grows their small businesses. <p>\r\n\r\nThe majority of the members invest their loan in fabric.  Many create beautiful traditional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d.  In addition, they also use the same creative techniques to make cloth napkins, table coverings, and other items for interior decorating.  The other part of the group uses the credit to raise livestock to be sold at the market.  This is a good business in rural areas where large enterprises in this arena have not yet arrived at the markets. <p>\r\n\r\nYou will find several outstanding businesswomen among this group.  For example, Mrs. Candelaria H. told me she was currently employing three women to make cortes, a traditional skirt, and another woman to make cloth napkins.  Mrs. Albina Yiax commented that she raises chickens, and uses their waste to fertilize her maize crop. <p>\r\n\r\nInterviewing this group of women was a pleasure and wonderful assignment because they are hard-working ladies who, despite their difficult situations, keep a lovely smile on their faces.  It is for this reason that you must provide them with your support. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Entrando al lugar de reuni\u00f3n de las mujeres que conforman el grupo Uk\u00b4Ux Kem uno puede sentir la diferencia entre este grupo y un banco comunal promedio. En mi caso, pude sentir un ambiente alegre que se materializ\u00f3 en risa incontrolables que hasta en un punto \u00a1llegaron a ser un breve impedimento para proseguir con la entrevista! Este punto lleg\u00f3 cuando les pe\u00ed a las compa\u00f1eras que levantaran la mano las que criaban animales y la traductora les dijo que levantaron la mano las que son animales.  \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres Uk\u00b4Ux Kem no solo son inigualables en el sentido de la alegr\u00eda que reflejan sino en la manera como trabajan y utilizan el cr\u00e9dito. Al parecer, todas las clientas creen que el cr\u00e9dito las ayuda a superarse empresarialmente, ya que les ayuda a aumentar su capital y por ende agrandar su peque\u00f1o negocio. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de ellas invierten su dinero en tejido. Muchas siguen elaborando bellas blusas t\u00edpicas llamadas huipiles. Asimismo, ellas tambi\u00e9n elaboran usando la misma t\u00e9cnica servilletas, caminos de mesa, entre otras cositas para el interior de las casas. Otro grupo de mujeres utilizan el cr\u00e9dito para criar animales y luego venderlos en el mercado. Este es un buen negocio en las \u00e1rea rurales en donde grandes empresas, dentro de esta industria, todav\u00eda no entran al mercado.  \r\n\r\n<P>En este grupo se puede encontrar varias empresarias destacadas. Por ejemplo Do\u00f1a Candelaria H. cont\u00f3 que ella estaba actualmente contratando a tres mujeres para que tejan cortes, una falda tradicional, y una mujer para que teja servilletas. Do\u00f1a Albina Yiax coment\u00f3 que ella criaba pollos y que las eses fecales son utilizadas para abonar su milpa o cosecha de ma\u00edz.\r\n\r\n<P>Entrevistar a este grupo de mujeres fue un placer y a la misma vez una linda haza\u00f1a porque son personas luchadoras y que a pesar de su dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n ellas mantienen una bella sonrisa.

He is the father of two children of whom he is really proud because they have excelled in their school in the municipality of El Sauce in the beautiful city of Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua. <p>\r\nA problem that Mr. R. has faced for some time is that there is no electricity in his community because he lives in a rural area. It is difficult for them to have light at night, which he does by means of an oil lamp that only illuminates a section of the living room and not the rest of the house. As a result, he has requested the installation of a solar panel to have electricity. He now has a debt which he must pay off, so he is seeking the help of Ceprodel to obtain a loan that will help him pay for the panel, thus providing his beloved family with better living conditions. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nMario R. es un caballero que se ha destacado por ser muy trabajador y dedicarse al negocio agropecuario habiendo adquirido basta experiencia a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os que se ha dedicado a esta labor.
