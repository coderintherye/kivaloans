She has been doing this work for quite some time, she used to work with her mother, but after some time she bought her own stand. She stresses that her stand is in a good location, as there is a great flow of people, above all travelers. The competition is high, as there are many similar stands in the area, but even so she has many customers. This is her 3rd loan, she has demonstrated relatively good payment history, as she was behind in some of her payments which she attributed to the problems in the state such as civic work stoppages and the shortages of fuel, propane, which impeded her normal activities; and in addition to these challenges she was pregnant. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva

They own their home, and devote themselves to the hard work of selling chicken, chorizo, eggs, etc. Mr. Hugo has his own stand within German Moreno market that he has worked at for many years. Through this experience, a strategic location within the marketplace, and the popularity of the market itself, the stand has managed to continue attracting many customers despite competition. This loan will be used to invest in the maintenance of the vehicle Hugo employs to transport his chickens from his home to the stand. The family has an excellent credit history (this will be their 8th loan!). Previous loans have been paid back in full, and, due to the profitability of their business, they are currently right on schedule for repayment of those loans that are still outstanding.\r\n<br

His business is mattresses production. For 3 years he has been manufacturing soft mattresses. He began working in mattress production in a business, then saved, and with his severance decided to begin. This has benefited him until now, as he has increased his inventory, also thanks to Afodenic for the support that they have given him to improve his business. This is his fifth application, which he requests in order to invest in the purchase of four 100 pound strips of material to manufacture mattresses.

The Christian Reform Church Primary School Kabala was founded by Mr. Dennis De Groot and the school started its operations on the 26th of September 2007. At the end of the war, the school was set up with a desire to give quality education to the children of Koinadugu District and to rebuild good moral attitudes in the minds of the children by diligently teaching them the word of God. The school currently has 147 pupils with a staff of seven.<p>\r\n\r\nThe school is still a new one with only classes one to five. Come next year, they will get their first group of pupils to write the National Primary School Examination (BECE). Only two years since its inception now, the school has gained a reputation for quality education. It is the only school in Kabala with a ratio of thirty pupils to one teacher. It has a very good resource center for both teachers and pupils. They encourage teachers from other schools to use their resource center. By comparison, their resource center is far more equipped than many secondary schools in the town (i.e. for the few schools that have a library). It is also the only primary school in Kabala that provides cooked rice to its pupils. Other primary schools either do not have this facility or manage to provide for their pupils with bulgur wheat supplied by the UNHCR. <p>\r\n\r\nThis school is not a government-assisted school like the other schools in town; hence, it gets all these opportunities that are lacking in other primary schools. Its teachers receive their salaries from Frasirvalley Christian High School in Canada, and their salaries are said to be far better than government-sponsored schools. (Learn more about this school at http:\/\/kabalaschoolproject.blogspot.com).<p>\r\n\r\nThe Christian Reform Church Primary School Kabala suffers from a few constraints. The school is situated far away from the town center, making it strenuous for both pupils and staff to come to school everyday. The continuing rise in the cost of food stuffs is also affecting the running of the school, and in addition to these, the school currently lacks enough drugs to give first aid to the children.<p>\r\n\r\nJames T. K. (left) is the Head Teacher of the school. He was born in Koinadugu District and he is thirty-five years old. James is married and the couple have four children together: one is in secondary school, one in primary school, one in nursery and the last is still sucking. With this loan, James will buy building materials like bags of cement, truckloads of sand, and boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":271720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T11:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James T.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bunduka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bockarie S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahim ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama S.

Her greatest wish for her business is to have a very large store where she could better stock the clothes she sells.\r\n\r\nMaria has a hard time finding clothing as she is very demanding, but she always manages to have the most fashionable clothing in the market.  In order to achieve her goals she is prepared to work hard and she clings to her idea of becoming prosperous.  This is Maria's fourth loan with MFP; she has been very punctual in her repayments as she always sets aside a portion of her profits to repay her loan.  She is very much respected in her community bank as she is the eldest member.  With this latest loan, Maria will increase the amount of clothing she has for resale; she will invest 1,000 soles to buy clothing in order to better stock her stall.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":271859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":176.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117065,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":176.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011978,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":176.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595563,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":176.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989825,"comment":null},{"amount":54.29,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":176.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210961,"comment":null},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":174.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T20:09:12Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89186,"name":"Dionisia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nDionisia empez\u00f3 con su negocio, una tiendita D. abarrotes que tiene en su casa, para ayudar a su esposo que se qued\u00f3 sin trabajo.

She is going to plant them on a small part of her father\u2019s farm and wait patiently for 3-5 years for them to bear fruit.  Eunice says the only thing she can do is to plant them\u2014even though she will have to wait several years, once they begin producing fruit she is sure her economic situation will improve.  Then she will be able to rent or buy some farm land, so she doesn\u2019t have to keep working on someone else\u2019s farm.  This is her second loan with MFP and she hopes to begin working with her community bank.  She is committed to making her payments on time.  The money she is asking for will be used to buy fertilizer for the banana plants and if there is money left over she will buy a few more banana plants to keep planting.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":271996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T21:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423761,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117070,"comment":null},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011983,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595568,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989830,"comment":null},{"amount":29.76,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210966,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-17T22:02:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89235,"name":"Hercilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nA sus cuarenta y nueve a\u00f1os, Hercilia ha trabajado en casi todo.

Por la noche descansa en su casa, pero prepara los alimentos en la casa de su madre. De peque\u00f1a realizaba las labores agr\u00edcolas y el cuidado de las vacas, ahora con su propia familia, siembra mayormente espinaca; pero le es m\u00e1s rentable comprar por chacras porque al comprar se puede calcular por un aproximado de 40 canastas, pero al cosechar saca entre 60 o 70 canastas, esto le permite pagar peones y transporte de los productos, as\u00ed gana un 50 % m\u00e1s de lo invertido.

El dinero  que ha solicitado es para la compra de grandes cantidades de avena para alimentar a sus vacas y que no deje de faltarles la leche, y de ese modo cubran sus gastos familiares. ","en":"Rosmery is 27 years old, has lived with her husband for 9 years and has a son.  At night she sleeps at her home, but prepares food in her mother\u2019s home.  Since she was young she has worked in farming and raising cattle.  Now that she has her own family, she mostly grows spinach.  Spinach is profitable because when you purchase a field and calculate that it will yield about 40 baskets of spinach, it will actually yield between 60-70 baskets during the harvest.  The extra crop allows her to pay workers and to transport her products, and she earns 50% more than she invests.  At the same time, she also works with her mother delivering milk.  For the past 27 years her mother has delivered milk to restaurants and bakeries.  Now Rosmery and her mother alternate weeks\u2014one week Rosmery delivers milk and the next her mother delivers it.  Rosmery is very content with what she does and has plans to increase her spinach crops.  She will also increase her oat crop in order to feed her cows.  Rosmery is an entrepreneurial  member [of the community bank] and very punctual at their programmed meetings.  This is her twelfth loan and she has always been on-time with her payments.

She now lives alone, and because of this, she works very hard as a cook in a restaurant near her town. While her husband was alive, he worked on a small farm, where he cultivated pineapples, bananas, and coffee. Now his plants require fertilizer and other treatments, and Ana spends a little time on the weekends tending to them. From Monday to Friday, she works as a cook in a restaurant from 4 in the morning until 9 at night, using her culinary skills. She earns 250 soles thanks to the good flavor of her food. During the coffee harvest, her salary increases to 400 soles since she has more clients. Ana is happy with her job as a cook and with her agricultural work, but sometimes, when she sees the coffee harvest she gets nostalgic upon remembering her large family. She knows that it offered the best to her children and that now they are good people. With her priD. she hopes to continue forward because she knows that life provides many surprises. Ana, in spite of her work, sets asiD. some time to work as the president of her community bank. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she is very punctual in making her payments. The money that she is requesting will be used to buy fertilizers and the other part will be used to order cutting her coffee farm and to grow without difficulties. She wants to invest in her farm since it has been left to her and her husband and because her husband would have liked it. She is also thankful to the community bank because she has learned the responsibilities of repayments and it has given her the opportunity to continue working. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":272028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423763,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117075,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011988,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595573,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989835,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210971,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640474,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080118,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996405,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":170.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841938,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T17:22:58Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89251,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, convive hace 4 a\u00f1os, con su compa\u00f1era y madre de su hija de 1 a\u00f1o y 8 meses, actualmente viven en la casa de sus suegros.

He repairs radios and television sets; this is his passion and he is very happy doing this job.  He also buys used electronics which he repairs, replacing missing parts and reselling them for a good profit.  Carlos says that when it is not time to harvest the coffee beans, people do not have money and then do not need his services; but, when harvest time comes in April, his income improves to 400 to 500 soles per week not including the income from selling used televisions and radios.  His wife sells clothing and he wants to help her with part of the loan which he is requesting and so encourage the growth of his businesses.

Because of this he sells books and other articles and is paid in installments so that his kids can have the tools they need to study.

She has a lot of business plans but she lacks financial capital to pursue her goals in life.  She always keeps in mind that \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d.

She worked as an employee for 23 years in a filling station in the city, but she stopped because they were laying off workers. She had wanted to return, but 6 months have already passed since this, and she hasn\u2019t had a positive response. Because of this, Maria decided that she didn\u2019t want to depend on anyone, so she decided to raise young animals, especially rabbits, which she sells in the markets, under the amount of 21 soles. These earnings allow her to buy alfalfa (animal feed), and are also used to necessary products. Also, she has decided to venture into the sale of cheeses, dulce de leche, and red meat, with the end of selling them to her friends and family. At the moment, though, she is in the process of investing in the purchase of these products. She is very afraid of failure, but right now, she has a lot of faith in the progress in her business. She is a very active member of her community bank and is the treasurer. She fulfills her duties very responsibly. This is her twelfth loan with MFP and in all this time, she has shown that she makes her payments on time. The money she requests will be used to buy cheeses, dulce de leche, and red meat. The money will allow her to venture into this business. She is very thankful to all the people who have made this loan possible because it lets her have hope of prospering.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":274888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Capital to invest in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T15:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":257.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117081,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":257.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011994,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":257.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595579,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":257.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989841,"comment":null},{"amount":79.18,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":257.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210977,"comment":null},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640478,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T16:31:58Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89266,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine L. runs a community store in the village of Alibagu Ilagan, Isabela.

She is the driving force behind her husband\u2019s activities. She is the mother of a two-year-old son and, at present, they live in her mother-in-law\u2019s house. She has offered unconditional support to her in-laws for 10 years through the crops from the farm, like by buying and selling fruits and by transport to the markets and cities. She is looking for economic independence, so she has acquired a motor-taxi, which she is paying for in installments. Her husband already works with the vehicle, so that they can finish making the payments. Also, Reyna began selling sodas and candies in her mother-in-law\u2019s premises, with the end of turning it into a well-stocked small store.\r\nThis pair has many dreams of growing and prospering with their work, combining the earnings from the vehicle and from the sale of candies. They hope to have a field of citrus and bananas in her parents\u2019 farm, but they will be their own crops. Reyna enjoys working in the farm a lot, but what she likes most is business, so that she hopes it will grow to a small store. Natilde has just been sworn in as president, and she promises to fulfill her obligations. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and in all this time, she has paid her installments responsibly. The money she is requesting is to take the payments for the motor-taxi forward. In this way, she will accumulate money to repay all the installments. The remaining amount will be used to buy sweets and sodas. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":272063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for her motor-taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T00:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423767,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117082,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011995,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595580,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989842,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210978,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640479,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080120,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996407,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":170.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841940,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T02:05:27Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89269,"name":"Imelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imelda C. is 42 years old and married to Romeo, a farmer by day and a fisherman by night.

Tras la desgracia del huayco (salida del r\u00edo, causando derrumbe de cerros) que sufri\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2007, Vilma interrumpi\u00f3 su trabajo, ya que sus prendas y dem\u00e1s mercader\u00eda fueron afectadas, arruinando sus ventas, hace dos a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 de cero su negocio y fue sobreponi\u00e9ndose poco a poco, alquilando un local, desde entonces viaja a Lima a traer mercader\u00eda cada 15 d\u00edas. Adem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n es instructora de aer\u00f3bicos, cobrando por semana 40 soles; su esposo tambi\u00e9n  trabaja en la venta de ropa, pero \u00e9l lleva la mercader\u00eda a otros lugares fuera de la ciudad.

She has lived with her husband for the past 17 years, and they currently live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nThe flashflood of 2007, during which the river overflowed, causing a landslide, suspended Vilma's work, as her clothing and other merchandise were affected, ruining her sales. She started her business from scratch two years ago, and has been building it up little by little, renting a storefront and travelling to Lima every 15 days to buy merchandise. In addition she works as an aerobics instructor, earning 40 soles per week. Her husband also works selling clothes, but he takes his merchandise to other places outside of the city. When they need to make an investment they combine their weekly earnings of between 500 and 800 soles. This allows them to pay the rent on the storefront and the education expenses for their daughter, who wants to study fashion design. Vilma is very happy with her two jobs, which fill her with hope for the future, and she is thinking of building her own home.\r\n\r\nVilma is a very active member of her community bank. She is the treasurer, a position which comes with a lot of responsibility. She is very happy belonging to this community bank, with this being her fifth loan with MFP, and having made all of her repayments on time. The loan will be used to build up her capital, through purchasing clothing merchandise.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sally Bolton, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":272066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T23:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423768,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117083,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011996,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595581,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989843,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210979,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640480,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080121,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":301.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996408,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":301.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841941,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T01:12:29Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89272,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lolita M., 54 years old, lives in Barangay Lapogan Tumauini, Isabela.

She is the mother of 3 children who live with her in her house.  She works as a nurse in a hospital and has a lot of friends since she is so charismatic.  She has taken advantage of her popularity by selling backpacks and suitcases for the school season.  She buys directly from the manufacturers, mostly at inexpensive prices, and sells the merchandise individually at a higher price.  This business has been very profitable and has allowed her to cover the expenses of her household.\r\n\r\nCarmen offers the merchandise to her co-workers in the hospital and the rest of her customers are the classmates of her children.  However, during one past school season, her business was not as profitable, so she started investing her profits in cosmetic products, and continued selling to her customers this way.  Despite her job as a nurse, she still makes time to attend the meetings of the communal bank, and holds a position distributing bank communications to all members.\r\n\r\nThis is her twelfth loan from Kiva partner MFP, and has always demonstrated that she repays the installments on time.  The money she is requesting is to purchase additional backpacks and suitcases.  Carmen is truly thankful to those who make this credit possible since her salary as a nurse technician does not cover all her expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":272067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase merchandise from manufacturers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T00:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117084,"comment":null},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011997,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595582,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989844,"comment":null},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210980,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640481,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T00:16:27Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89275,"name":"Nora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nora B. lives in the village of Barangay Lapogan Tumauini, Isabela.

She is a single mother with 3 children, who live in her own house. Years ago she lived in a rural village, cultivating fruit plants, but owing to the needs and costs for her children, she saw it necessary to migrate from her village to create a bigger business that could cover the needs of her children. It's for this reason that she dedicated herself to the sale of fruits by cart, 3 years ago. She did very well, resulting in a profitable business, and thanks to this she was able to acquire land where afterwards she built her house from wood with the help of her family. There she established her business selling chicken meat, which little by little has captured more clients and has permitted her to obtain good earnings. It's because of this business that Lidia is very happy, because she also has been able to add a small business selling beer in the same establishment. She has just received the position of treasurer at her communal bank, which makes her happy, for the confidence that it shows. This is her 5th loan with MFP and in all this time she has repaid the loans with great responsibility. With the money that she is requesting this time, she will invest it in her chicken sale business, and will also buy more fruit, and will increase the amount of beer that she sells. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":272069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Buy goods for her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T23:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117085,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011998,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595583,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989845,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210981,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640482,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080122,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996409,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841942,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":203.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733744,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T01:41:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89278,"name":"Lailani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lailanie M. lives in Barangay Yeban Sur of Benito Soliven, Isabela.

Aside from her store, she would also like to expand her hog raising business.  With this, she is asking for a loan of PHP4,000.00 that she can use to purchase two piglets and maybe 30 kilos of feed supply.  She will also use the loan to purchase additional merchandise for her store.  \r\n\r\nShe is hoping to uplift their living status through her patience and hard works in the business. Elvira also prays that all her children will someday finish their college education and hopefully have a better job in the future.

According to Rosalinda, the village where they live is peaceful and businesses are progressing since it is near to the public market of Ilagan, Isabela. \r\n\r\nRosalinda has been helping her husband manage their small electronic shop in their village for almost 12 years. She wanted to make a difference in the coming days thus Rosalinda wanted to request a loan amounting to PHP7,000 that she can use as business capital.  She intends to use the loan to assist her husband in purchasing additional equipment or materials needed in their electronic shop and for the maintenance of their passenger jeep.  She said that their family business is really of great help in sustaining their needs and allowances of her children to school.

T. is so grateful that their own backyard, where they raise eggplants, has been their source of income since 2003.  Indeed, it has been a great help to her and her family composed of her husband and four children who are all beyond the age of 20.\r\n\r\nShe wants to request a loan amounting to Php6,000 in order to purchase farm inputs which include water supply and fertilizer to ensure a good harvest.  Being in the business of growing and selling vegetables for five years has taught her a lot of experiences, one of which is having a poor harvest resulting from inability to provide the needed fertilizer and water supply.  She does not want it to recur so she grabbed the opportunity to get a loan from a micro-finance institution which does not only offer monetary capital but also renders capacity building such as seminars on agriculture and financial literacy.  \r\n\r\nTeresita has high hopes that her business will grow and they will become more successful and ultimately have their own stall in the market

She is 26 years old, single and she still has no plan of getting married at the moment.  \r\n\r\nShe manages a Panciteria (a small canteen business selling cooked noodles and other snacks) business in their village.  She has been in this business for two years and her store is open from 6:00 in the morning until 7:00 in the evening.  She usually goes to the market once a week to purchase the necessary ingredients she needs and to minimize transportation expenses.  Before reaching the public market, she needs to ride a ferry boat and tricycle. \r\n\r\nTo further improve her business, she is asking for a loan amount of PHP5,000.00 that will serve as financial assistance in purchasing the main ingredients such as eggs and pancit (soft noodles). She is also planning to engage in the hog raising business and buy one piglet.  Lina dreams of uplifting the living condition of her family. This is the reason why she keeps on working hard to attain her dreams.  \r\n

Due to financial difficulties, his studies were interrupted at the end of high-school. At age 20 Osvaldo moved from the Matola to the Boane district, where he still lives. He has been working as a driver-mechanic for 7 years. Working Mon-Fri, from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, his monthly salary is 8000,00 mt, which allows him to save some money--he currently lives in a house lent by his uncle. This is his first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. He learned about Hluvuku though a friend, who is already a client. Osvaldo plans to pay his first loan back quickly, so he can apply for another one, to finish building his house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

Evelyn D. is a native resident of Sibalom, Antique, Philippines. She is 36 years old and blessed with 4 children.

She started this business since she joined  ASHI. Before, she only read cookbooks and recipes. At the moment she needs to purchase a refrigerator for her frozen products. As of now she is suffering from grief over the death of her 3-year-old child. But she still looks forward to the success of her business. As another source of income, she also sells ice, plates, umbrellas and appliances.<P>\r\n\r\nEvelyn dreams that someday she may have a stall in Manila where all her homemade frozen products would be there.

Six years ago, her family moved to UlaanB., the capital city of Mongolia, from Uvs province, which is 2,000 kilometers away. Since she moved, she has been running a meat stall business, buying a whole cow or sheep and selling it off cut by cut, to feed her children and survive in the big city. <P>\r\n\r\nAs a country woman, she has experience butchering goat and sheep meat. All her children help with their mother's business after school. Otgonbayar lives in a \"ger\" -- the traditional nomadic housing used on the Mongolian steppe -- sharing her relatives' yard and paying rent. She is taking her fifth loan with XacBank, Kiva's partner MFI in Mongolia. Her dream is to see all her children graduate from the university.

This works to her advantage as her clients find her to be very flexible about payment, and she has built up a good reputation this way. For instance, if someone has no money for cab, she says that \"You can pay tomorrow.\" She also doesn't smoke; therefore, her cab is cleaner than other cabs. One year ago she sold her old car which was made in Korea and bought a second-hand but better Nissan \"Sunny\" Japanese car. Ichinhorloo is one of Kiva partner XacBank's best clients and repeat borrowers. She keeps working hard for her children's future. Her dream is for her two children to finish their high school successfully and graduate from university.

Tursunoy has a very good taste and she is ready to advise her clients which textile to choose for this or that occasion. That is why she has her constant customers. Moreover Mukaddas\u2019s prices for fabrics are attractive for various levels of the population as she has the wide range of goods for any taste and any wallet. The income that she derives allows her to educate her children. She hopes that she can continue to provide for them so they will be able to receive an adequate education. Now Mukaddas needs $ 1000 USD for purchasing new fabrics in order to increase the range of goods for selling. She promises to pay the loan without any violation and expresses her gratitude to everyone supporting her. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rohat is 39 years old. She is married and the mother of three children. Rohat's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business as an ecologist didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the family. This was the reason that Rohat decided to start her own business 9 years ago selling the fabrics of the national dresses. <p>\r\n\r\nLittle by little, she has made her business grow and by allowing her clients to pay in installments, her orders are getting bigger. Now, her business is running smoothly; however, she would like to continue bettering herself and her business so her situation will be stable in the future. She is asking for a loan of $1000 USD that she will pay back in 3 months. With this money, Rohat will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for the national dresses. The power to help her business to grow is in your hands. <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History:<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

On behalf of Sanovbar and everyone here at IMON International, thank you for your support!\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.  \r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has a daughter of 17 whom he needs to support and properly educate. Muhammadjon has improved his financial situation because he has been able to wisely use the loans he has received from IMON International to breed his animals. Nowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer animal derivates (as dairy products) in the surroundings of his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has a kid. Difficult living conditions forced her husband to leave to earn money in Russia. Mavzuna has been running a grocery store for the past 5 years. Currently, her business is the only source of income for her family of a little child and the parents of her husband. She sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks and also detergents in her grocery store. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Mavzuna is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. Mavzuna is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan to increase inventory. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Mavzuna reach all of her aspirations.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Khalik is a teacher of school by profession, but he earns very little so he also runs a business of raising and selling cattle. He has 11 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Khalik has become a very successful businessman. Khalik has a friendly family who always try to help each other. Thus, his wife and daughter help him with the cattle raising business. He works very hard and spends his weekend time with the cattle, cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. Now Khalik wants to expand his business and buy more cattle, so he applied for a loan. He promises to repay the loan on time and thanks all lenders for their support. With your help, Khalik can get ahead.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Upon returning from the market, she goes directly to TOKPA (the international market of Benin), where she delivers her goods to wholesalers and retailers, who in turn resell them at TOKPA.

Mar\u00eda de la Paz Hern\u00e1ndez is a working woman who sells new clothing, such as jeans, shirts, blouses, bedclothes, and underwear.  She sells her merchandise in the community where she lives and has a stand set up in her house.  Currently, she also sells her goods at a melon packing company called Excosur.  She hopes to continue growing her business, since it has allowed her to help her husband improve the livelihood of their children.  She has two girls who are currently in school and they help their mother with her business in their free time.  Her husband is a construction worker who works at various locations in the village.\r\n\r\nAna Isabel \u00c1lvarez is a young, married woman with a 6 year old girl.  Ana sells snacks such as enchiladas, tacos, small cakes, and banana chips.  She sells her goods out of the her house and her business and sales have grown to the point that she spends every afternoon selling her snacks. The entire village comes to buy and she runs out of all of her products.  She wants to purchase vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, chilis, and cabbage from the sellers in cars that pass through the village.  Also, she wants to buy condiments and other goods that she can buy from the local store.  With these, she hopes to continue growing her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Luisa Madariaga has been selling food and snacks for 4 years.  Previously, she sold her products exclusively out of her home, but since her business has grown, she now also sells in Excosur and Promangle.  This has generated income that has helped her husband with the household expenses.  She is the mother of three children, one is in 4th grade and the others are not yet old enough for school.  She leaves her children with her mother when she leaves to go sell her goods.  Her husband is a welder and is not able to spend very much time at home.\r\n\r\nEtelvina Sarai has been selling new clothing for 4 years.

At the beginning she started selling bread and alfalfa, and little by little began getting clients. She expanded her business with the sale of panca chili, a business which until now she has operated from her own house. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan of 300 soles that she received from her communal bank, 'Mujeres Decididas II' (Determined Women II), she invested it in buying alfalfa and panca chillies for her business. With this loan of 800 soles, which she will pay back within 4 months, she will invest it in buying alfalfa and panca chillies. Maria dreams of having a grocery store in her house. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":273287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy alfalfa and chillies to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo-Trujillo-La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T23:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Maximina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20418219,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111685,"comment":null},{"amount":116.25,"local_amount":372,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":375.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006877,"comment":null},{"amount":8.75,"local_amount":28,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":28.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590530,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-19T00:23:24Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:43:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89506,"name":"Alicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nDo\u00f1a Alicia O.

Thi Bien is 55 yrs old. Her husband died early; she lives with 1adult son. In 2005, she joined TYM fund and borrowed money to invest in raising animals. Currently, besides raising animals she also makes wine to increase her family's income. In addition, her son also helps out and thus her family's economic situation is improving daily with income of 175 USD per month. In the near future, Ms. Bien plans to open a grocery store and thus wishes to borrow 525 USD to invest in this business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu

They supply themselves weekly at the Diamarabougou market for all the condiments mentioned above. They sell at retail, in cash or on credit, in the Diamarabougou market and at home to a clientele composed primarily of women.\r\nThey intend to realize an average monthly profit of 11,000 FCA, which will be used to buy soap and meet the nutritional needs of their families.

She has one child and is currently living in a house she owns, where they prepare and sell crates of fruit.  Since she was young, Erasma has been working in agriculture and for the 40 years she has been married she has raised and harvested plantain, citrus fruit and avocado.  In those times the harvest was good but now they only have a limited number of fields which they harvest every 15 days and are not very profitable.  In her free time, Erasma makes containers and crates to keep the fruit.  She and her husband never thought this business would be as profitable as it has turned out to be and they now have good demand, creating between 100 to 150 containers or crates which they sell for 90 c\u00e9ntimos or 1 sol each depending on the fruit packed inside.  Her husband is very pleased with this activity  as he has her unconditional support and that of her child who also helps with preparations.  Together, they go looking for customers, to offer they merchandise for a good price.  This business is making them very happy and allows them to make between 100 and 150 soles a week, money which covers the daily food needs of the family.  Erasma has in past loan cycles been the group treasurer and she accomplished this task with great responsibility, ensuring the repayments were always recorded correctly.  This is her fifth loan with MFP with which she hopes to continue.  She will use most of the loan to buy materials to build crates and a smaller portion to buy fertilizers for her plantain fields.  Erasma is very grateful to all those who have made her loan possible as it will allow her to continue working.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":273386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy materials to make crates to sell her fruit and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-19T01:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erasma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117097,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012010,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595595,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989857,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210993,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640494,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080123,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996410,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841943,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":202.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733745,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-19T05:28:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89569,"name":"Mayra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"MAYRA P., pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLAS TRIUNFADORAS\u201d, ubicado en la Av.

Desde su infancia realizaba el labrado y cultivo de sus chacras, pero ahora que tiene 3 hijos, sus necesidades se han incrementado, entonces hace tres a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s volc\u00f3 todo su inter\u00e9s en la compra y venta de frutas, que en \u00e9pocas de enero a abril es muy rentable, pero el resto de los meses es bajo; debido a ello puso otro negocio, el alquiler y venta de CDs, negocio que le est\u00e1 resultando muy rentable, porque no tiene mucha competencia, ya que su \u00fanico competidor est\u00e1 ubicado en el otro barrio. Maribel con la venta y alquiler de pel\u00edculas lleva 6 meses, y se nota su alegr\u00eda con este negocio, el cual ya le est\u00e1 captado ganancias, ya que por cada CD que alquila cobra 2 soles cincuenta y por la venta 3 soles, ella los vende en horas de la tarde y la compra y venta de frutas lo realiza cada viernes. Maribel nos comenta que estas dos ganancias las trata de ahorrar, para de ese modo contrarrestar las \u00e9pocas de poca  demanda de las frutas, asi que la venta de CDs es el principal ingreso a su econom\u00eda. Ella en todo este tiempo ha demostrado ser una cliente muy puntual en sus pagos, y asiste de forma puntual a las reuniones de su banco comunal, este es su quinto pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo, pag\u00f3 sus cuotas de acuerdo al cronograma programado por su asesor de cr\u00e9dito. El dinero que solicita es para incrementar los CDs, tanto para alquilar como para la venta, ya sean musicales y de pel\u00edculas. ","en":"Maribel is 21 years old; she has been married for a year and has three children with whom she is living in a rented house.  Since she was very young she has worked and farmed her fields, but now that she has three children her needs have grown and so three years ago she threw herself into the purchase and sale of fruit which is very profitable between January and April, but not so in the other months of the year.  Because of this, she started another business: renting and selling CDs, a business which has proven very profitable because there is little competition given that her only competitor is located in a different neighbourhood.  Maribel started selling and renting movies six months ago and her satisfaction with this business is obvious.  She is making good profits as she rents each CD for 2.50 soles and sells each for 3 soles.  She sells in the evenings and buys and sells fruit on Fridays.  Maribel tells us that she tries to save the profits from these businesses in order to offset the times when fruit sales are low: the sale of CDs has become her main source of income.

","en":"Eveline is 25 years old and the single mother of one daughter.  She currently runs a business making prepared foods in a rented space.  When she lived with her parents, she only dedicated herself to her studies.  However, once she had a child, she started her business from the rented locale in order to meet her financial needs.  She rented a location that is well-situated, through which a great number of people circulate as well as the buses and cars that travel between provinces.  In this way, the drivers of these vehicles became some of her best customers, and her restaurant is one of the most frequented in the area.  This has allowed her to pay the rent of 150 soles for her location, and also to support her daughter.  Eveline enjoys her work, which is why she starts as early as 5 am and closes at 9 pm when the buses stop running.  These days, business is not great and she sells 18 to 25 dishes.  However, during the coffee harvest season she sells upwards of 35 to 40 plates a day, allowing her to provide some comforts for her daughter.  Eveline has shown at all times to be punctual with her payments to MFP, and she is in her fifth loan.  She isn\u2019t able to attend the reunions of her cooperative bank very often, because there is no one to fill in at the business for her.  The funds she requests are for the purchase of provisions so she can prepare her daily menus and, in this way, begin to prepare for the coffee harvest season which is approaching.  From here, she thanks the people who make it possible for her to continue to work.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":273508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase provisions for her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-19T20:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eveline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117100,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012013,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595598,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989860,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210996,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640497,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080126,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996413,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":105.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841946,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":105.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733748,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T01:00:47Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89585,"name":"Adelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Adelina V.

Rano is 44 years old. She is married and has four children. Rano has been running a grocery store for the past 2 years. She sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks and also detergents. The goods she has for sale are of very good quality with a wide selection. Rano is respectful and patient with all of her customers which attracts people and brings them back to buy groceries from her again. Rano is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of $ 600 USD for the term of 9 months to increase the inventory she has for sale. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Rano reach all of her aspirations.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, and as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th century BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet and New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has two children. Berdimurod has a general store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs, etc.. With a starting capital of 500 USD, thanks to perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise 8 years ago. \r\n\r\nOver time, he expanded his business and today this has  become a family business and his daughter and son are also engaged in this business. Today he needs to buy additional foodstuffs to increase the range of his goods. With this purpose in mind,  he is requesting a loan of  800 USD for a term of 9 months. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. \r\n      \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.
