","en":"Tessito is a solidarity group composed exclusively of women. It has been created in October 2002. It consists of eight women, all belonging to the Bambato Banc Villageois, which is named after their village. They are between 30 and 40 years old on the average, and each has at least four children.\r\nTheir activity is selling brooms and palm oil--two products they make themselves. The brooms are made from palm leaves, and the oil from palm nuts. Palm oil is a rare and much appreciated product in the northern and central regions of the country and can be sold at a good price in those regions, which results in good profit margins.\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow the group members to strengthen their business by purchasing a larger quantity of palm nuts as well as palm leaves in order to increase their level of production.\r\n\r\nThe group leader, Mrs. Awa P\u00e9lagie S., is 30 years old, married, and the mother of four dependent children. She is engaged in the same business activity as her peers, production and sale of brooms and palm oil. Her goal is to increase her revenue in order to be able to help her husband provide for the family needs.\r\n\r\nApart from making regular payments on their loan, the group members also put aside a monthly amount to add to their savings with the main Banc Villageois group. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":536321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Boosting the business capital of the group in order to increase its revenues","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Ziguinchor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-05-08T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e9ning","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa P\u00e9lagie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aramata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josianne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ta\u00ef","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":695000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":695000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1375,"local_amount":695000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":696105.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-10T21:45:52Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:19:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":199050,"name":"El Buen Pastor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Buen Pastor est\u00e1 conformado por Isabel  V., Ana Mar\u00eda Borge R. y  Melida Rosa Guzm\u00e1n tres mujeres trabajadoras, esforzadas y emprendedoras que en este tiempo han ido mejorando su negocio.

She has been working since she was seven years old selling peas, beans, carrots and other vegetables in season and ever since she has been in constant activity, buying and selling in bulk. Her mother helps with the business and also cares for her children. Sometimes she drops off and picks up the children at school which has allowed her to get ahead. Her greatest desire is to have a permanent stall within the marketplace, but so far she has done her sales as a traveling vendor. Her business is profitable, since he knows many people who come to her market stall. However, the most difficult and dangerous part of her work is the need to get up early to go to wholesalers, who will provide products to sell, but also expose her to potential assault and theft of her cargo. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she pledges to continue her payments. In her community group, she is a very dynamic and responsible participant.

Hern\u00e1ndez  is a member of the group.  She is 40, studied up through 6th grade of primary school.  She is a businesswoman and has 2 daughters.  For the past 5 years she has been selling ceramics, going from rural community to rural community, from house to house, with weekly payments or bi-weekly, depending on the customers.  She is asking for the loan to supply her business more since sometimes collections are slower.  Because of this she needs more money to have more inventory to offer her customers.  She is planning on buying vases, cups, plates, salt shakers, napkin holders, plant pots, arts and crafts, etc-as much as the loan will cover.  She wants this loan to make her business grow and with the earnings that she will generate, she wants to save so that in the future she can fulfill her dream of having her business in its own location.  For now she has the walls, but is missing the dishes and accessories so that it will be set up well. She wants to stop traveling from one place to the other and stay in her own place.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n- Nancy Guadalupe Z. S. (lingerie sales)\r\n- Patricia R.

They live in Atlacomulco, in the State of Mexico, where the people press forward with great commitment and attitude despite facing various hardships in their daily lives.  The group consists of ten members.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group treasurer is Roc\u00edo E. C\u00e1rdenas.  She is 25 years old and studied through high school.  Unfortunately, she says she had to quit school because of growing responsibilities at home and having to support her family by sewing.  She is single and does not have children, but she is responsible for taking care of her nine siblings together with her mother.  Every day she looks for ways to meet their needs.  She makes tablecloths and napkins that are mainly sold in San Marcos Tlazalpan, Toluca, Mexico City, Santiago Acutzilapan, and Atlacomulco.  Rocio learned how to sew at a young age without realizing that one day this skill would become a source of income.  She always enjoyed sewing and was taught by her mother.  Even though she had a hard time learning how to sew at first, Rocio\u2019s dedication and perseverance resulted in the excellent work she produces today.  She faces many challenges as a result of her weakened eyesight, but fortunately her family helps her with her other jobs.  Upon requesting this loan, Rocio thought about what she would be buy and had always wanted to start a business making linens, so she will use the money to acquire the necessary materials.

R. is from Surf Miputak, Dipolog City. She is 43 years old, married, and has 7 grown children and 1 school-age child. To make a living, Janeth owns & operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling dried fish in the local community. Janeth has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Janeth joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Janeth is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory, and as working capital. This will be Janeth\u2019s 5th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family\u2019s general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":535270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

To help her husband in supporting their family, she decided to engage in a little business operating a sari-sari (variety) store. For 10 years now she has been able to manage this little business and she is now earning an average net income of not less than PHP 4,000 a month, which is so helpful to their family's income.\r\n\r\nShe joined the cooperative in 2009.  As an active member and at the same time the center chief of the Jakarta center of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting an amount of PHP 6,500 as her second loan for the purpose of adding to her capital for her existing business activity, which is a sari-sari (variety) store business.\r\n\r\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of her family, to meet their basic needs and for savings for future use. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Celia is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Celia S.\u2019s Group. \r\n\r\nCelia is married to Jaime S. Sr., a fisherman, and they are blessed with 2 children, one at school age and the other one is an infant. To help her husband in supporting their family, she decided to engage in a little business - specifically the fish vending activity. For 2 years already, she has been able to manage this little business and now she is earning an average net income of not less than PHP3,000.00 a month. This amount is so helpful to their family income. She is requesting an amount of PHP4,000.00 as her 1st cycle loan availment for the purchase of adding to her capital for her existing business activity. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs and savings for future use. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Nabbotuan, Solana, Cagayan.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Mercedita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Mercedita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercedita successfully repaid a previous loan of 25000 PHP from ASKI. Mercedita is requesting a new loan of 25000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Mercedita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations for her vegetable and spice business and her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is requesting her 11th loan in the amount of Php 13,000, which she intends to use for both her businesses.

Leslie is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory for her store and to expand her seaweed business.

A. is from the town of Talibon. She is 31 years old. Robelyn is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Robelyn operates a fishing business. She makes her own \"panggal,\" a fishing basket made of rattan. The main source of income for her business comes from catching and selling fish at the market. Robelyn has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Robelyn joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Robelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Robelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including rattan, hooks and nets. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Robelyn from CEVI, a Kiva partner. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\n<b>About CEVI<\/b>\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over recent years.

She is 27 years old, married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Claire Eileen owns and operates a fishing business. She makes \"panggals\", fishing baskets which her husband uses to catch fish. She also sells these baskets to other fishermen. She sells her husband's catch in the market. She has been engaged in this business for over two years now.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Claire Eileen joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Claire Eileen is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan which she has taken out from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over recent years. Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":536594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Talibon, Bohol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10.149167 124.325","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2010-05-07T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claire Eileen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1241.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144690013,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3104.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151873448,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2483.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159613267,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2483.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166827645,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3104.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093934,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-07T13:38:14Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":199166,"name":"Yusuf","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 41 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435 -

Par exemple \u00e0 ce jour, madame Kavira S. n\u2019a pas des marchandises parce que il n'y a que\u2019un seul v\u00e9hicule qui fait ce trafic routier transfrontalier, et seulement 3 ou 4 operateurs ougandais qui font ce transport avec leurs v\u00e9hicules jusqu'au fronti\u00e8re entre l'Ouganda et le RD Congo.\nDans l\u2019avenir, elle ambitionne louer, elle seule un camion de poissons Tilapia sans se faire liguer avec d\u2019autres associ\u00e9s de sa corporation.  Elle reste tr\u00e8s optimiste en soulignant qu\u2019un jour elle sera grand fournisseur des poissons tilapia dans la ville de Goma. Dans le futur, elle souhaiterait  acheter sa propre parcelle et y construire une maison, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est encore locataire de maison. \nMadame Kavira S. remercie l\u2019IMF Hekima pour  les cr\u00e9dits  qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit sans aucune garantie mat\u00e9rielle car gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces cr\u00e9dits, elle parvient \u00e0 subvenir aux besoins de ses enfants.\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Kavira S. is an entrepreneur, a seller of tilapia fish.\u00a0 She is a 14th cycle client, 27 years old, married, and the mother of two children, aged 9 and 4.\u00a0 Both are in school.\u00a0 Her son, the eldest, is in the third grade, and the other is in kindergarten.\u00a0 Kavira's husband is also a fish seller.\u00a0 She and her husband help each other in this business selling tilapia.\u00a0 She started her small business with her own funds.\u00a0\n\nKavira was once a small-scale merchant, a fish seller without working capital, a retailer.\u00a0 She used to speculate with goods (fish) belonging to her friends and acquaintances who were already wholesale merchants.\u00a0 She got the fish on credit and resold it, paying afterward.\u00a0 This was a way for her to become familiar with self-sufficiency.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the small profits from her informal business accumulated and enabled her to build up $50 in capital to start off.\u00a0 A year later, she availed herself of the first loan with the micro-finance institution Hekima.\u00a0\n\nIn the past, when Kavira had a small revolving fund, she used to sell fish from Lake Virunga (in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) formerly called Lake Edouard, Lake Edi Amine from the fishery of Vitshumbi and Nyakakoma, two villages located 150 km from the city of Goma.\u00a0 Later, when she saw her capital increase in volume, she immediately favored changing her supply source in order to make more profit.\u00a0 She sells tilapia from Lake Victoria in Uganda.\u00a0 These fish are specifically bigger compared to the fish from Lake Edouard.\u00a0\n\nShe has been in this business selling fish for eight years.\u00a0 She situated herself in the public space on Katindo Road, at the entrance to the military camp.\u00a0 \n\nWith the Hekima loan, Kavira wishes to increase her sales by buying 600 kg of fresh fish called gros tilapia.\u00a0\n\nKavira explains that the major challenge in her business is related to fish spoiling, especially when the ice has turned liquid in the cooler for keeping the fish fresh.\u00a0 Furthermore, the transport of Uganda-Kampala merchandise toward the Democratic Republic of the Congo poses a problem, as much as there are not enough transport vehicles involved in this sector for transporting fish.\u00a0 For example, today, Kavira has no merchandise because there was not one vehicle running the trans-border trade in the DRC, and only three or four economic Ugandan operators using their vehicles to take fish as far as the border.\u00a0\nIn the future, Kavira has the ambition to lease, on her own, a tilapia truck without joining forces with other companies in her corporation.\u00a0 She remains very optimistic, emphasizing that, one day, she will be a major supplier of tilapia in her city of Goma.\u00a0 For the future, she wishes to buy her own plot of land and to build house on it, since she is still renting a house.\u00a0 \n\nKavira thanks Hekima for the loans she receives without the need for any collateral at all because, thanks to these loans, she is managing to meet the needs of her children.\u00a0 \n<br

She is 44 years old and married, with 6 children who range in age from 2 to 26 years old. Mariam could not continue her education through 3rd grade due to lack of financial support.\r\n<p>\r\nFor 10 years, she has been selling hardware, such as nails, locks, and hinges, on a table at the Red Light market in Paynesville, Liberia. Mariam started selling with funds she borrowed from her savings club, but has now improved.

He is 44 years old, married, and has six children who range from one to fifteen years old. James could not continue his education through 11th grade due to lack of financial support.\n\nFor the past five years, James has been running a vegetable farm at the White Plain settlement, Liberia. He started his farm through the help of an international NGO in Liberia, but he faces problems with a shortage in tools to do his work.

The bank\u2019s name means \u201cTangled Eye Lashes\u201d or \u201cBeautiful Eyes.\u201d  It was formed by Elizabeth (president), Janeth (recording secretary) who managed to gather 10 trustworthy,  hard-working, responsible people from El Alto to join.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, group president, cells CDs and cell phones.  She rents her house in the Alto Lima neighborhood.  Her husband is a traveling salesman of the same items.  Her greatest wish is to have her own house so she is very interested in the savings that working with this activity makes possible.  She has collaborated with us for several years now.  She is a very hard-working person who is always watching after her family\u2019s wellbeing.  She will use the funds to buy large amounts of the latest models of cell phones so that she can thus increase her working capital.\r\n\r\nJaneth, recording secretary, is an underwear merchant.  Although she\u2019s single, she\u2019s her family\u2019s sole source of support because she helps her mother and younger sister with the household expenses.  Besides her business, she\u2019s also studying and trying very hard.  Her greatest wish is to get into the university and become a professional.  She will use the funds to buy merchandise by the dozen so that she can thus increase her working capital.\r\n\r\nThis is a very unified group; they support each other.  Carolina is treasurer and she sells anticuchos (skewered grilled beef heart served with potatoes and spicy chili peanut sauce).  This activity makes it possible for her to help support the family because her husband, who is a plumber, doesn\u2019t earn very much.  They have an adolescent daughter that they\u2019d like to see become a professional.

He is 47 years old, married, and the father of 5 children ages 22, 20, 15, 13, and 9.  All attend school except for the eldest.  He only completed school through the fourth grade, due to a lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family, and in addition to his children he supports his daughter-in-law who lives with him.  He left Massinga for Maputo to look for work in 1982, later he moved to Boane where he made his home.  He has worked as a security guard for the company Banalandia since 2008.  He does not have any employees and has a salary of 1.800.00mt per month, which he uses for household expenses and occasionally saves a bit in his bank account.  \r\n\r\nHe has never had a loan with other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through word of mouth from friends who are also customers.

Her husband is a salaried driver and her daughters help her with household expenses and with her business.  They live in her brother-in-law\u2019s house occupying two bedrooms and a kitchen.  Her dream is to build her own house although that is pretty difficult at the present time.  She says she will reach her goals, though, as long as she has life and health.  She will use the funds to buy ingredients and a new stove for her meals.\r\n\r\nAdela, group treasurer, took out the loan to invest in her butcher shop and also to buy vegetables to sell there as well.  She lives in her mother-in-law\u2019s house.  Her husband works and helps her a lot.

The previous loans were for 3,000 meticais and 5,000 meticais, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica promises to pay off this loan on time in order to take out other loans.  Her dream is to improve her family's living conditions.  In the future she intends to ask for more loans to help her business grow.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

He is 43 years old, married, and has 4 children who are 25, 18, 14 and 11 years old. All of them are in school.  Reginaldo only studied through the 4th level under the old system of education. He didn't continue with his studies due to the war of colonial occupation. He lives in his own house with his family, and also takes care of an uncle and a brother who live with him.\r\n\r\nReginaldo left Inhambane for Maputo in order to comply with the obligatory military service. He first arrived alone and then brought his family so that they could live together in Boane. He has worked as a blacksmith for more than 23 years and has 3 employees who help him in his work. He has a monthly income of around 12,000.00 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some money in his bank account each month.\r\n\r\nHe has never taken out a loan with another bank, and found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through an aunt who also works with the institution. This is his 1st loan, for the amount of 13,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy iron for making grates and doors, in order to increase his stock and respond to his customers' demand. \r\n\r\nReginaldo promises to repay this loan as agreed, in order to be eligible for other loans in the future. He plans to ask for future loans to expand his shop and make his business grow even more. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She is asking for funds to buy raw materials that she uses such as: clay, firewood, grout and dyes.  Her dream is to build her own kiln so that she can spend more time as a potter; currently she only produces small amounts because she has to borrow her neighbor\u2019s kiln and carry all her materials back and forth from home.

She is the leader of a nine-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<br>Felicitas is 35 years old, married, and has two infant-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food and drink in the local community. Felicitas has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2010, Felicitas joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be her first from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":536654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a hard worker and over the past 18 years has been involved with trading to make an income.  Her son currently studies at the Railway College in Gyumri,which is in Shirak Marz.  The annual tuition for her son\u2019s studies is around $115.  She enjoys living in her village and would like to have a sustainable business in agricultural production.  She is seeking a loan to grow vegetables and maintain a few cows.  Currently she lacks the funding for the purchase of fertilizers, seeds and animal feed.  She expects to grow her monthly income by 15% with the loan.  She is choosing this business because she has the knowledge to grow vegetables and maintain cattle and would like to remain living in her village.  Her biggest impediment to meeting her business goals is the investment required for fertilizers, seeds and animal feed.  Her additional income from the business will continue to support her son\u2019s

They average 28 years of age, have an average of four children and live in nuclear families with their children and husbands. These women live in the Torakabougou district of the town of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The women met through neighbors and business, and they run businesses buying and selling condiments, palm oil (as is the case for Fanta Kant\u00e9) and cereals. With the aim of increasing the volume of their purchases, they decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are on their second group loan; all previous loans have been repaid in full.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fanta Kant\u00e9 has been buying and selling palm oil for the past eight years. She gets her supplies of palm oil from wholesalers in the Republic of  Guinea. With this loan, Mrs. Kant\u00e9 is planning on buying 250 liters of palm oil which will be sold wholesale, retail and for cash in the town on Bougouni, to a customer base made up essentially of women. She is planning on making an average monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA, while the other members of the group expect to make a monthly profit of 20,000FCFA each, which will be used for their various

Mohira grew up in a home where the principal work was, and is, agriculture. She acquired skills in this field when she was very young from working with her parents. Agriculture has become her principal source of income and she dedicates most of her time to the attention and care of her agricultural products. Through her daily work, she looks to give her family security and economic stability. However, due to unexpected difficulties, she cannot cover all of her expenses, and she needs a loan to improve her products and increase her sales. Her objective is to construct a house on land that she acquired a little while ago. All of this can be possible with your help. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history.  It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They sell heating wood, cereals, and the beignets they cook themselves (which is what Ass\u00e9tou Colibaly does, for example). In order to boost their capital and maintain a sufficient level stock, they have decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. They are now on their sixth group loan, all previous loans having been duly reimbursed.\r\n\r\nIn order to process 5 kg [11 lbs] of cereal into beignets, this is what\u2019s needed: first, the cereal is husked; then it is pounded into flour; then, 3 liters [a little under a gallon] of water, 3 pinches of salt, 2 pinches of leavening and 0.5 kg [about 1 lb] of sugar is added, the mixture is kneaded well in order to produce nice dough, which is left to rise for at least one hour. After that, a big frying pan containing oil is set on the stove and the dough is spooned out into the pan. In three minutes, the frying is finished, the beignets are removed, and the process  begins again. \r\n\r\nIn order to continue with this work, Mrs. Ass\u00e9tou C. plans to use her loan to purchase 500 kg [1100 lbs] of pearl millet, 10 liters [2.6 gallons] of cooking oil, 1 kg [2.2 lbs] of leavening, 10 kg [22 lbs] of salt and 20 kg [44 lbs] of sugar.

Modier\u00e9 Sidib\u00e9 has worked in the restaurant business for more than 10 years. She learned the business from her older sister. Very well known and appreciated in Bougouni, she has many clients. After three group loans with a neighbourhood association, she is currently requesting her seventh individual loan, all the previous loans having been promptly repaid. With this new loan, Modier\u00e9 will buy a freezer as she spends more than 1500FCFA each day buying ice for her customers. The freezer will allow her not only to make ice, but to store food as well. She plans to buy the freezer in Bamako (Mali's capital) from a wholesaler. She hopes that this new equipment will allow her to make an average additional 45,000 FCFA per month. With this income she hopes to improve her restaurant and build her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Emily Martyn, Kiva

Gulya is 41 years old. She is married, and a loving mother of 4 children. Gulya started her business 19 years ago because she needed extra income to be able to pay for household and personal expenses, and she also needed her own income in order to afford her home. She began selling kids\u2019 clothing and shoes, and because she always liked sales, things went well for her after the business was started. She has continued selling clothing since then. Gulya is requesting a loan of 4500 Somoni in order to expand her business. She hopes to earn more money and to cover all of her children\u2019s expenses. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history.  It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a responsible mother of two children, who are now 24 and 30 years of age.\r\n<p>\r\nHer business started when she began receiving contracts to produce clothing for important customers and a few housewives.  She also started sewing for neighbors, friends, and relatives on an informal basis.  The sales from these two businesses were important for her success, but unfortunately they went bankrupt.  Sonia was greatly depressed by her significantly low sales and had to temporarily live off of her savings.  Fueled by the love of her family, she started a new job working for a designer and afterwards became independent a few years later with the help of the loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Upon her return, she named her business \u201cSonia\u2019s Apparel\u201d, which is located in the neighborhood of Recreo, a busy commercial area in the city of Barranquilla.  With these loans she was able to buy an industrial machine that allowed her to continue working independently.

He lives in the San Francisco de Rum\u00ed pamba precinct about an hour and a half from the San Miguel Provincia de Bol\u00edvar County.  He is a member of the rural bank, San Francisco de Rum\u00ed pamba, which is composed of 25 members in total, the majority of whom work in agriculture.  Manuel works in agriculture and is the main breadwinner in his family.  The most popular crops in the area are potatoes, wheat, and corn.  He sells his products at the Guaranda market.  Manuel is seeking a credit to be able to purchase herbicides for his cultivations.  His goal is to be able to buy a vehicle with which he could use to transport his products to the markets.  One of the challenges that he faces are his fear that the prices of his products will lower.  During his free time, Manuel likes to listen to music and dance.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":537217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase herbicides for his cultivations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":159,"posted_date":"2010-05-09T09:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo Manuel   ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188659656,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-02T12:14:47Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":199425,"name":"Damacline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Damacline is 21 years old and is single.

Castro, who offers these services out of her small store in which she also sells decorative household items and other products.   \n\nCandelaria sells items for every occasion, especially accessories for girls, alongsiD. hardware products, but also has a true flair for sewing and repairing garments.  For this reason she is seeking another small loan of $2,200,000 Colombian pesos from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy her very own sewing machine, so she is not totally reliant on using her neighbor's machine.\n\nAt first Candelaria had a tiny store in the Blas D. Lezo neighborhood where she sold soft drinks, staples and foodstuffs.  Then she became a member of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has proven to be very responsible in managing and paying off small loans.  Two prior micro-loans have allowed her to increase her working capital and acquire needed furniture and other items; she notes that \u201cmy life has changed since I've had the opportunity to grow my own business and develop an entreprenueurial vision, extending this to my home and organizing greater participation of my family in running the business.\"  She is fully confident that she can better

He travels to different sites to serve his clients. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of $1000 from the Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l.

Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loan from Kiva to offer lower interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling US $115 million.

Kiva borrower from Lebanon is a 46-year-old married man. He lives with his wife and child. Both he and his wife work to support the family. He has owned his own mini-market since 1997. These small stores are common throughout Lebanon and can be found in almost every neighborhood. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of $1000 from the Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to increase his store\u2019s inventory. This will be his first loan from Ameen. He estimates that the loan will help him increase his profit by 15%.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.).

is a 48-year-old cobbler who makes and repairs shoes at his shop in a busy market area of Serem in Rongai.  He is married with five children, two sons between 20 and 25 years old, and three daughters between 11 and 23 years old.  He has been in business for ten years and does work for schools, factories, and local people.  \r\n\r\nFestus plans to use his 40,000 KES loan to purchase more raw materials like leather and soles.

Saturday did not have the opportunity to go to school due to poverty.\n\nFor the last three years, Saturday has had a money changing business.  Liberia's currency is the Liberian\ndollar, which trades at about 70 LRD to the U.S. dollar, but the U.S. dollar is also legal tender in the country and is widely accepted.  Firestone, the country's largest private employer, pays its employees in U.S. dollars, so Saturday's services are in high demand when it's payday for Firestone workers. Saturday also sells mobile phone chargers at the Harbel market in Margibi county, Liberia.\n\nHe started selling at the Cotton Tree community in Harbel City with 20,000 LRD as working capital. He has a good manner of approach towards his customers, which keeps them returning. Saturday plans to use his 4,000 LRD portion of this 20,000 LRD group loan to purchase more mobile phone chargers and to use in his foreign currency exchange business. His goal and dream is to own his own booth from which to operate and become financially strong in the near future.\n\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Saturday is holding the sign.

He doesn't have any employees but with the help of his wife he earns between 1200 and 1500 Meticales a day. He uses this money to pay for household expenses, and also saves some money each month through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nAdriano has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] when he saw the sign outside of the Hluvuku office in Boane and he decided to apply for a loan. This is his first loan, for the amount of 10,200 Meticales.

He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who have also worked with the institution. This is his 4th loan, for the amount of 11,000 Meticales.  He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, iron, sand, blocks and other items) in order to continue working on his home construction project. His earlier loans were for 10,000, 10,000, and 13,000 Meticales and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later.

She is also motivated to work in this field because this income helps her family get ahead.  \r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica reports that she is very happy working with her fellow members of \"La Posta,\" because they are hard-working and honest, and all of them want to improve their lives. \r\n\r\nMEMBERS\t                   ACTIVITY\r\nJos\u00e9 David S.
