The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":431578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":431596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy

She lives with her husband and 2 daughters in Corredores, a rural region of Southern Costa Rica. Juana has a business selling hand-made clothing, necklaces and bracelets from her home. She demonstrates a strong work ethic; assembling jewellery, making and selling clothes by day, while working evenings and nights in a local restaurant as a waitress.\n\nSimilar to the story of many low income individuals in Costa Rica, and across the world, Juana has found it impossible to obtain approval for a business loan from the local bank in Corredores. The bank requires a guarantor of a loan to be someone who is not part of her immediate family. Juana does not know any suitable guarantors, with a steady income and a secure job, other than her husband. From Juana\u00b4s perspective, the rules of the formal banking system have had the effect of excluding her from the financial services she seeks.\n\n In an effort to extend the reach of financial services to deserving entrepreneurs, Fundacion Mujer proposes to lend Juana 500,000 colons (around $862 US), with her husband as the loan guarantor. This will be her second loan with Fundacion Mujer. Juana received her first loan in 2008 for 100,000 colons ($173 US) which was repaid from her business earnings, on time and in full, within 6 months.\n\nWith this loan, Juana plans to purchase raw materials such as cloth and necklace parts in an effort to expand her jewellery and clothes-selling business. Recently, many of Juana\u2019s regular clients have inquired about the possibility of purchasing shoes. She would like to satisfy this demand and expand her business by providing quality footwear to her clients. She will use this loan to buy shoes from a contact in Panama to sell from her home in Costa Rica. Juana dreams of expanding her business and earning more money so she can provide a better standard of living for her family. She says that since starting her business 2 years ago, her self-confidence has increased. Juana is now a strong believer in her ability to improve living conditions for her family through her determination and hard work. \n\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the betterment of the lives of families living in a poor community of southern Costa Rica. By lending to Juana, a hard-working entrepreneur, you are enabling her to build towards a higher standard of living. On behalf of Juana and her family, we thank you for your

The older one is 26 years old and has two children.  Since she lives at home, she contributes toward the household expenses.  The younger daughter is an 18 year old student.  Rosalina travels once a week to be with her family, who lives at her house in the region of El Papayal.\n\nRosalina wants to add a room to her house that measures 4x4 square meters so that she can provide better conditions for her daughters.  Her house is currently small in size, but she plans to take in her elderly mother so that she will be able to have someone look after her.  For this reason, she is requesting her fifth loan.  Rosalina dreams of having a large house so that her family can live comfortably.  If God permits, she would like to apply for another loan in order to fulfill that dream.  Rosalina expresses her gratitude to AFODENIC for providing the loans that helped gradually improve her home over time.  She plans to leave this house as an inheritance to her daughters and grandchildren.  \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

C. is from the village of Eastern Poblacion, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental.

The main source of income for the business comes from operating tricycle transport. Juanito has been engaged in his business for over 30 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juanito joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juanito is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. This will be the first loan taken out by Juanito from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Marie Claire is a proven entrepreneur! She has had her own shop selling a variety of goods since she was just 25 years old. She works long hours to make her store a success: the hours of her shop are from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nAlthough Marie Claire has been in the business for six years, her capital reserves are still too low to allow her to expand her shop.

V. is 39 years old, married, and she sells cola soft drinks for a living. She started her business a short time ago. Yenis does not have much capital to buy the pops and she is buying small amounts.

His wife, Alina Bustamante, works in a supermarket. They are tenants in the Villa Litoral zone. Don Jorge buys the stale bread that is left over from his wife's work each day, which are collected and wrapped in bags and left to harden. Once there are a few bags of hardened bread, Don Jorge buys them and afterwards carries them back home to grind in a small grinding machine. Later, he sells the crumbs by the hundredweight and pound. Don Jorge is a very reponsible person towards his job and his family. He is requesting a loan for the purchase of a larger grinding machine since the one he currently has is a manual machine, and the one he intends to buy is semi-automatic.

She heads off to work Mondays and comes back on Fridays every week. She lives with her mother. This is her first loan request and hopes to be the beneficiary of the kiva fund to finish building her kitchen. As of now she has it in her small living room.  She has initiated the beginnings of a kitchen and only needs to build three more walls and a roof. With the loan she will buy the materials and work until she repays the loan. She states that through her coworkers, who are also clients of this institution, she found out that AFODENIC and KIVA support individuals to improve their standards of living.

P. M. is a 37-year-old woman living in the town of Siutu Salailua.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Mutia owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Mutia has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 420 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mutia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mutia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Mutia is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mutia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is a 32-year-old woman living in the town of Puleia.

Iulieta has been in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 360 Samoan tala (about $143 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Iulieta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Iulieta is requesting a loan of 1000 tala which will be used to purchase a fishing boat.  This will be her first loan from SPBD. Iulieta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Puleia.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Ruta owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Ruta has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.   Ruta is now requesting a loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  This will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Ruta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. I. is a 53-year-old woman living in the town of Vaisala.  She is married and has 6 children.  To make a living, Toavalu owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising chickens for sale.  Toavalu has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 370 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Toavalu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Toavalu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals to raise.  Toavalu is now requesting a new loan of 1450 WST which will be used to expand shelter for the borrower's livestock.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Toavalu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of her children.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is a 65-year-old woman living in the town of Vaisala.  She is married and has 6 school-aged children.  To make a living, Pea owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Pea has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 150 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Pea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to repair borrower's fishing boat.  Pea is now requesting a new loan of 1450 WST which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Pea plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a 30-year-old woman living in the town of Papa Sataua 1.

Sulamai has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 300 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sulamai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase land on which to raise additional crops.\r\n\r\nSulamai is now requesting a new loan of 1,450 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

F. is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Papa Sataua 1.

Fefaloai has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 220 Samoan tala (about $88 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fefaloai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fefaloai has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Fefaloai is now requesting a loan of 1000 tala which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Fefaloai plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her child's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Papa Sataua 1.

Legalo has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 510 Samoan tala (about $204 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Legalo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Legalo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Legalo is now requesting her second loan from SPBD; she is asking for 1500 tala to buy harvesting equipment.  Legalo plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

V. is a 64-year-old woman living in the town of Faiaai.  She is married and has 6 children.  To make a living, Fili owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Fili has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fili joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fili has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Fili is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Fili plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of her children.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is a 65-year-old woman living in the town of Faiaai.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Fialogo has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fialogo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fialogo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Fialogo is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  <P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

G. is from the village of Bay-bay Bonifacio Misamis Occ. She is 43 years old. Evangeline is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Evangeline owns & operates a fishing business selling seafood products like fish and shrimp in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evangeline joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Evangeline from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and pay for tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

I. is from the village of Tru-Cut Sapang, Misamis Occidental. She is 45 years old. Elsa is married and has 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Elsa sells bananas in the local community. Elsa has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elsa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsa is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional bananas to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elsa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. is from the village of Eastern Poblacion Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the local community. Virgie has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Virgie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virgie is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to repair her fishing boat. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Virgie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<p>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

J. is from the village of Eastern Poblacion Lopez Jaena Misamis Occidental. He is 56 years old. Salcedo is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Salcedo owns & operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the local community. Salcedo has been engaged in his business for over 30 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Salcedo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Salcedo is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Salcedo from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Dorothea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from GDMPC. Dorothea is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Dorothea from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

and her husband are striving hard to earn a living for the sake of their family and also for the education of their children.  They live happily with their four children in the village of San Nicolas, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. They want their children to finish their studies and become successful someday. \r\n\r\nHer husband works as a tricycle driver while Marietta provides Pedicure and Manicure services in their village. She offers her services to her neighbors, especially the employees within their village. Through her patience and sacrifices, she can earn a net income of PHP600.00 a week, which she uses to acquire their daily needs and for the allowances of their children. She wants to offer her services to the nearby villages but she doesn\u2019t have enough capital.

She is fifty-five and is a mother of three children. Atyrgul and her husband are in the sheep-breeding business. In the beginning they had to save diligently in order to purchase their first livestock. Eventually they were able to buy a cow, and later they started to breed livestock and sell it as necessary. It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of having livestock for Atyrgul and her husband: with the income they earned they were able to build a house, give an education to their children, and even bought an apartment in the capital. Atyrgul and her husband also grow vegetables in their own garden. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the livestock-breeding business, Atyrgul keeps cows and sells milk. Just the monthly profit from the sale of milk is about 2700 soms (local currency). But twenty years ago, when they just started their livestock business, they were able to buy their first cow for only 1000 soms. Nowdays a cow costs almost twelve times as much. Atyrgul and her husband know the value of time. When they raised their children they tried their best to give them an education and the freedom to choose their profession. And the children have made their choice: they decided to go into police work. The eldest son is twenty-nine and is married. He is a police detective. The middle son is twenty-seven and he is not married yet. He works as as a detective as well. The youngest son  has not yet finished college. Atyrgul wants to purchase an additional dairy cow. Without a loan it will take her a long time to save up enough money. She really hopes to obtain this loan so she can realize her plans. She would would like to get her two younger sons married and also to increase the size of her flock. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAtyrgul has three partners in her group:\r\n\r\nRahat A. is thirty-seven. Rahat is raising four children. Her husband is a construction worker. Rahat stays at home and takes care of her five year-old-son. However, she also finds enough time to tend her livestock and sell milk. Rahat would like to get a loan to purchase a bull.\r\n\r\nRoza B. is forty-two. She and her husband tend to their sheep and cows. They are raising three children. The eldest daughter is sixteen, and the youngest son is seven. Roza is seeking a loan in order to purchase sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\nDinara O. is thirty-six. She is a mother of three children. Her spouse is a self-employed electrician. Dinara has a home-based retail business. She would like to get a loan in order to purchase a stock of goods to sell.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

O. is 39 year old single mother who lives with her three children in Uvs province, one of Mongolia's western provinces. All of her three children are secondary school students. Lhagvasuren's family moved to the town from the countryside, where she was a herder, four years ago in search of a better life for her family. She now runs a small rented food store with a few basic items. Her store is located in a good location where there are always many people around. Her store customers usually purchase mutton, beef, and liquid milk that she sells.\n\nIn the future, she hopes to expand and renovate the store and eventually purchase this store instead of renting monthly. She says that it was hard to herd livestock in the countryside and she came to the town to seek a better life and education for her children. Lhagvasuren notes that she would like to see her children be well educated and pursue their dreams.\n\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase more food items including mutton, beef, and milk for his store.\n\nAbout XacBank:\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva's 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans. This not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to save.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":432838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

O. is from the village of West Kibawe Bukidnon. She is 55 years old, married, and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Sonia owns and operates a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing specialty tailoring services to local community members. Sonia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sonia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sonia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Sonia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles and thread. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Sonia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is 29 years old and the father of 2 daughters. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Uvs province, one of Mongolia's western provinces. His oldest daughter is 9 years old and a first grade student at a local secondary school, while his other daughter is just 2 years old and stays at home.\r\n\r\nBattogtoh drives a cab in the town, which he bought last year. In the winter, he sometimes works in local gold mining - a temporary job that gives some additional income for his family. Since he bought the taxi cab, he has been able to earn some income on a daily basis and contribute to his family's income. He says that he works hard to bring up their daughters and make sure that they get a good education and pursue their dream professions. He is requesting a loan to purchase the necessary motor accessories for his car to get it repaired well.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Rosita has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Rosita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Rosita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

J. is 54 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Khovd province in western Mongolia. He and his family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent. His oldest son and daughter, ages 22 and 20, are university students, and his youngest daughter is 16 years old and a high school student.\r\n\r\nBadamdorj operates a food cafe with the help of his wife in his town. His cafe specializes in a variety of traditional Mongolian dishes including Buuz (steamed dumplings), Huushuur (fried flour pockets filled with meat) and Lapsha (noodle soup). Badamdorj started his business in 2005 by renting an apartment to open his cafe. He has grown and improved his cafe over the years and today has a consistent operation. His earnings have allowed him to purchase a house for his oldest son and pay the tuition of his youngest two children. For the future, Badamdorj hopes to one day own his own apartment to operate his cafe, and is always looking for other ways to better his business. He says, \"I would like to buy a cow and begin producing milk and other dairy products which I can use in my cafe.\" Badamdorj is requesting a 400,000 tugrug loan to purchase a cow in order to produce dairy products for use in his cafe.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

J. is 39 years old and lives with her two sons in Khovd province, Mongolia. She and her sons live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian housing tent. Her oldest son is training to become a police officer at the Police Academy, and her youngest is a high school student. Bolormaa operates a clothes trading business out of a rented shipping container in her town. She previously managed a restaurant with her husband but started her new business in 2007 after his death. Bolormaa works very hard to grow and sustain her business as it is now the only source of income for her family. She has made much progress with her business over the last two years and hopes to save enough money to purchase her own shipping container in the future. Bolormaa is requesting a 1,000,000 tugrug loan to purchase winter clothes to sell this season. \r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans. This not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ready to wear items like shirts, ladies' blouses, and pants in the local community. Cresencia has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cresencia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cresencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Cresencia is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Cresencia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Alice has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alice joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alice has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Alice is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Alice from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Marites is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Marites from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Malaubang Ozamiz City. She is 47 years old. Adulfa is married and has six school-aged children.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Adulfa owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as sweet candies, biscuits, and mango, in the local community. Adulfa has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Adulfa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Adulfa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Adulfa is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Adulfa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and for daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is 59 years old and lives with her husband and three children in Khovd province, Mongolia.

She recently purchased a van using her savings from the business. \r\n\r\nMunkhtuya is focused on continuing her success in the future and says, \"It is hard to live if in Mongolia if you don't conduct your own business. Our shop is the only source of income for my family, therefore, my dream is to continue to grow my business in the future.\" Munkhtuya is requesting a 2,500,000 tugrik (MNT) loan to purchase grocery items for her shop.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

With this loan, they intend to buy 6 tons of corn, 500 kg of fonio (a West African grain), and 3 tons of millet. They purchase the products from suppliers in villages surrounding Bougouni and then resell them at retail prices at the Bamako market. Their customers are primarily men, and sales are made in cash. With this loan, the women each envision receiving a monthly profit of 50,000 FCFA to be used depending on each woman's individual activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":432955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of Grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amin Ata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763579,"comment":null},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152411,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991253,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021523,"comment":null},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746325,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778877,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-07T01:16:27Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":155773,"name":"Roath","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Roath N. lives in Rung Village in Kandal Province.

is a widower who lives in the Arkhangai province of Mongolia. He lives alone in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent, and operates a religious goods retail business in his town.

Last year, her business was affected by the price drop in the commodities market due to the economic crisis in Mongolia. She says that the business is starting to pick up and the demand for commodities is slowing recovering.

Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She is 56 years-old and married to Romeo who is a 59 year-old fisherman. They have ten children whose ages range from 14 to 36 years-old. The older ones have their own jobs and help their parents support the family, while the younger ones still attend school. Purita works hard to help her husband earn additional income to support their family of 12. She dreams that all of her children will finish their studies and have a good job.\r\n<p>\r\nJust like other wives who help their husbands support their family, Purita looked for ways to add on to their capital. In 1998, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could have access to capital so that they could buy additional fishing gear and equipment. Later, she and her husband realized that instead of selling the catch to a local vendor wholesale, they could earn more if Purita sold their catch to the community on a retail basis. This decision turned out to be a good idea as it also enabled them to develop good relationships with their regular customers. Now she earns a minimum of Php 6,000 per month from her business activities.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn her last loan she borrowed Php 19,500 as additional working capital for her fishing business.  After repaying that loan she now wants to borrow the same amount of PhP 19,500 for her 10th cycle loan to be used to purchase a new fishing boat.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

After he married, he continued working in the same business, watching the business grow as a result of his sacrifice, and seeing his family progressing more and more. In addition to raising animals, Sundur also runs a taxi driver service in his free times. \r\n<p>\r\nWith his previous loans, Sundur purchased one cattle. He sold it already and purchased two young calves, which he is rearing to sell. Today he wants to expand his business and buy more cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

49 years of age, Rahmat is married and has three children. His principal work is the buying and selling of cattle. This business requires lots of travel because he needs to go to remote areas where these animals cost less. This requires considerable financial means. The business is very profitable, but his lack of capital makes his income insignificant, and living conditions remain difficult in his household. \r\n<p>\r\nTo strengthen his business, Rahmat is asking for a loan of $1000 USD, which he will use to buy more cattle for expanding his business. This will allow him to meet the needs of his household effectively. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ozodjon is a 43-year-old married man with three children. He is a hard-working man who, while continuing to work another job, started his own business as a source of additional income and savings in case of unemployment. He knew many people who purchased cattle, and this motivated him to start his own business six years ago. Over time, Ozodjon has increased his cattle sales and he is proud to say that the business has been running well. Now Ozodjon needs additional capital to expand his business. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase additional cattle to sell. More specifically, he will reinvest the loan proceeds and grow the business, as he has been doing. Ozodjon and his family thank you very much for the support that you offer them in helping to expand his business and helping them give their children a better quality of life.      \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shokir, a 46-year-old married father of two, breeds calves and sells dairy products to the local people and dairy factories. The difficult circumstances and hardships in his life made him recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about six years he has been purchasing young cattle in the local market, fattening and then selling them. Raising livestock is the main income source in his family. Thus Shokir wakes up early every morning to feed his calves and cows with the goal of selling them at the best price in the local market when they have grown enough. Shokir`s main goal is to provide education for his children, and with this purpose in mind, he has applied for a loan in the amount of 5000 Somoni to buy calves in order to expand his business. Let's support this hard-working man and hold our hands out to help him. <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
