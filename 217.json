G. is 55 years old and lives in a small rural community of Costa Rica called Las Delicias de Upala, located in the province of Alajuela.  The activities that are carried on in this area are commerce, raising of milk and beef cattle, growing of basic grains such as rice, beans and corn among others. \r\n\r\nThis area is frequently affected by inclement weather, such as strong rain storms that cause flooding.  These have a considerable negative effect on agriculture and promote the development of diseases that afflict the cattle.  Therefore, the raising of poultry is a good alternative for a small business,  with less risk.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Modesta has 6 children, all of whom are grown and therefore do not live with her, but help her with various expenses.  She makes a living raising poultry, specifically the raising of chickens for fattening up and laying hens, for the production of meat and eggs respectively.  She sells her products to her neighbors in the community, who are very satisfied with their quality.\r\n\r\nCurrently do\u00f1a Modesta is requesting a small loan of 684,000 colones for the purchase of chickens for fattening and laying hens, also extract for their feeding and products for the prevention and treatment of diseases.  She also needs to enlarge and reinforce her premises.\r\n\r\nShe expects her small business to grow more after this investment, she will be able to tend to more customers and provide better products.  This will help to improve her living conditions and she will be able to assist her children.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Modesta is a member of the Community Credit Company Datraban, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

A. lives in Santa Tecla, in the department of La Libertad. No one ever taught her how to cook, how to manage, and much less how to run a business. Her dreams were precisely to have her own business with her mother. With perseverance and faith in herself and the support of her family, she has had a small store for five years in her own house, where she started selling tortillas. Now she sells all kinds of products that are used on a daily basis. Curiously, her only daughter, Erica, is also 5 years old, which clarifies the great turn that Ana Cecilia took in her life in only half a decade. Ana is requesting a loan, since she considers this to be the right time to bet a little more on her family and buy new merchandise to grow her store.

Martha and includes 12 members who operate various busineses, most of which entail sales of food, cold drinks and clothing items or, among the men, moto-taxi services.  Despite being a relatively new group, they know how community banks work and they have experience with institutions like Fundacion Agrocapital.  The loan will be used to buy supplies and materials necessary for the members' various businesses.  For example, spare parts for the members that operate moto-taxi services since they have to keep their vehicles in good order to operate their business and generate an income for their families from day to day.  The competition in their lines of work is high but each one of the members has a family to support and that's why they understand how important it is to be responsible and honest in dealing with their obligations.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a Jos\u00e9 Eduardo  a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nAsegura que su familia  se ha dedicado a esta actividad durante mucho tiempo, por lo que ha podido experimentar todos los cuidados que demanda, adem\u00e1s de la instrucci\u00f3n recibida por parte de sus familiares  a lo largo del tiempo. \nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Jos\u00e9 Eduardo es famoso en todo Costa Rica.

R. is a young gentleman of 21 years of age, single and currently lives with his mother, stepfather and two brothers. \r\n\r\nThe community where he lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita of Turrialba, Cartago Province. It is a small rural community of about two thousand inhabitants. They are engaged in milk production and coffee planting. It has an   irregular topography and is kept as a moist tropical forest. The community has very picturesque landscapes that combine the beautiful tropical forest gaps with coffee plantations and dairy farms.\r\nEl sauce is located about an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, the nearest trading center. However, several times a year the road becomes impassable due to the rains that hit the area. This is undoubtedly one of the main challenges for the community. When there were no activities many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or at banana plantations located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica. Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the neighbors look how to invest in projects in the same area and in this way avoid migration. \r\n\r\nAs part of the response to this situation, a cheese processing plant was established since two years ago. It is owned by the Milk Producers' Association of El Sauce, which motivated Jos\u00e9 Eduardo to start in milk production and sell it to this plant. \r\n\r\nHis family has been in this activity for long time, so he has experienced all the care it demands, in addition to the instruction given by their family members over time. \r\nThe cheese from the region where Jos\u00e9 Eduardo lives is famous throughout Costa Rica. It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \"cheese type Turrialba\u201d. For the \"Ticos\" (as the people of Costa Rica are known), they love to consume this product, you'll find in the tables accompanying any kind of food. For this reason, the market for this product is really good. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo wants to obtain a micro loan of \u00a2 500,000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy a cow and be able to start his business and be a successful micro-business owner and help his family to keep going, this is one of the things that motivates him to strive and work very hard. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo is a member of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, one of 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan, and he hopes to continue to grow personally and financially. He also stays that with this type of organizations and facilitators of credit he can spend more time on productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Adriana Pierce, Kiva

With this loan she will invest in the purchase of milk products, cosmetics and perfumes, and larger quantities of basic grains, groceries and vegetables to increase her revenues and improve the quality of life of her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":319018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of basic grains, milk products and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T17:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.05,"local_amount":564.63,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":593.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112216,"comment":null},{"amount":30.86,"local_amount":561.14,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":590.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533619,"comment":null},{"amount":30.65,"local_amount":557.31,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":586.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964978,"comment":null},{"amount":30.72,"local_amount":558.6,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":587.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875434,"comment":null},{"amount":151.72,"local_amount":2758.32,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2900.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713364,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T00:37:42Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108215,"name":"Ana Basilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn la ciudad de Chinandega, la se\u00f1ora Ana Basilia R. se dedica a su actividad de venta de artesan\u00edas de madera ofrecidas en su localidad el cual la posee muy surtida gracias a sus m\u00faltiples esfuerzos en su negocio.\n\nActualmente, el negocio requiere de una inversi\u00f3n por medio de la compra de los productos artesanos y para ello ha buscado el apoyo en Ceprodel para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de dichos productos y as\u00ed salir adelante en su negocio que tanto requiere de su apoyo por medio de dichas compras.\n\n","en":"In Chinandega city, Ana Basilia R. sells hand-crafted wooden items from her store which she keeps well-stocked thanks to her many business efforts.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the business requires an investment in additional wooden artisan works, and to do this she has sought the support of Ceprodel, requesting a loan to purchase these products so she can advance her business.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDesde hace varios meses que Don Mario  se dedica a la cr\u00eda de pollos para engorde y gallinas ponedoras para la producci\u00f3n de carne y huevos, el vende sus productos a los vecinos de su comunidad los cuales se muestran muy satisfechos. El dice que tener el apoyo y la ayuda de su esposa le facilita seguir con el proyecto. Adem\u00e1s dice que el proyecto le es muy interesante   ya que ha visto como poco a poco su negocio crece y la demanda cada vez es m\u00e1s fuerte.\n\nActualmente don Mario est\u00e1 solicitando un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para la compra de m\u00e1s pollos y gallinas; concentrado, y productos para el tratamiento de enfermedades; adem\u00e1s de ampliar y reforzar su local.

He lives with his wife and godson in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the province of Cartago.  It is a small, rural community with approximately two thousand residents.  Its inhabitants work in milk production and planting coffee. It has an irregular landscape and much of the land is kept as a tropical rain forest. The community has picturesque landscapes that combine the rain forest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and creameries. El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus to Turrialba, the closest commercial center.  Nevertheless, a few times a year the route becomes impassable because of the rains that hit the zone. This is without doubt one of the main challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there weren't any activities many people chose to leave and look for work in Turrialba in the banana farms located in the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Currently the price of milk and coffee have improved, therefore the residents are looking for how to invest in local projects and avoid migrating.\r\n\r\nFor the past few months don Mario has worked on fattening up chickens and laying hens for the production of meat and eggs.  He sells his products to the community residents who are very satisfied.  He says that having the support and the help of his wife helps him continue with the project.  Even more he says that the project interests him since he has seen his business grow bit by bit and demand is getting stronger. \r\n\r\nCurrently don Mario is asking for a micro-credit of \u00a2500.000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy more chickens and hens, concentrate, and products for treating sicknesses, in addition to expanding and reinforcing his premises. With this he hopes to grow his business even more and improve his quality of life.  He business is going well, but he hasn't been able to grow because of underfunding.  With the loan that he is asking for he hopes to increase sales and thereby improve the economic condition of his family.\r\n\r\nDon Mario is a member of the Sauce Production Association, one of 100 organizational members of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his fifth loan and with him EDESA hopes to continue to grow on a personal and economic level, along with actively participating in the credit organization in its community. \r\n\r\n<br

During this collaboration, she significantly expanded her business and used her loans purposefully.  Her older daughter helps with the business when Aenahon leaves to get her product.  Currently, Aenahon\u2019s store is located at the city central shopping center.  This shopping center was recently remodeled, and funds for remodeling were collected from all businesses leasing space there.  This slightly decreased Aenahon\u2019s business capital.  This is why she decided to request a loan and expand her product assortment. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":319070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand goods assortment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-19T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aenahon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1470.59},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1529.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":367.65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":367.65,"local_amount":1470.59,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44600138,"comment":null},{"amount":382.35,"local_amount":1529.41,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-26T07:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1560.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994584,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-19T22:30:53Z","paid_date":"2009-07-26T07:40:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108240,"name":"Sunatjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u0412 \u041c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0418\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 2 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044e \u0446\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0430\u043b\u0435\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430.\n","en":"Sunatjon used to work at a local construction material plant.

He is involved in buying and storage of dried fruits.  When prices go up, he sells and makes a profit to support his family.  This year, together with his friends, Nizomchon decided to start a new type of business.  They decided to open a professional studio that will provide wedding and other event services, recording and montage of weddings to cassettes and DVD disks, sound recording for local artists, etc.  Own capital was invested into equipment for the studio.  However, once all the expenses were calculated, Nizomchon and his friends discovered that they needed to purchase 2 computers and a montage remote control.

It is a well-known place in the city that attracts many people all year round.  Local citizens come here to wash and also to get haircuts at the on-site hair salon.  Besides a common area, the spa also offers private suites that come with refreshing drinks.  Hayothon works at the booking table where she accepts reservations and assigns private suites.  Besides this, she also runs a small store that sells personal hygiene products, towels, soap, shampoo, etc.  Hayothon wants to obtain a loan at MicroInvest for this purpose.  She requested a new loan and plans to purchase goods for her store.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

She resides and works in a semi urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala.\r\n\r\nNulu runs a hotel in Wankulukuku, one of the city suburbs. She sells meals to an average of 30 people a day, and works seven days a week. Nulu\u2019s major monthly expenses include rent for the business, electricity and medication. She doesn\u2019t incur extra transport cost to and from shopping as she buys from her place of work. She has been in this business for the last six years and sells to all categories of people. Her main challenges are increasing prices of meat and competition. Prior to this business Nulu sold sugar cane.\r\n\r\nNulu has been with MCDT (Micro Credit for Development and Transformation) for over five years and is requesting her twelfth loan, working all this time with the same group members.

Leonard is the leader of Bwagonga Eco Bakyara Tukwatanise in Ibanda. She is a friendly and hard-working 40-year-old widow with 6 children aged 5-18 years. Leonard also cares for 2 orphans. All the children are in school from S.6 \u2013 P.1. \r\n<p>\r\nLeonard is a farmer who has been selling agricultural produce for 4 years. Mostly she sells matooke, which is used for making a local dish once boiled.

M. runs a health clinic called Mau Summit, located at the junction of El-Doret and Kericho. He provides reproductive health services, post-abortion care, curative health and primary care services. On average, he sees 70-80 clients, most of whom are farmers. The largest challenge he faces is collecting medical fees that are due to him. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, he hopes to purchase lab equipment to improve the clinic\u2019s facilities. He would also like to purchase more medicine to dispense to patients directly from his clinic, as the closest pharmacy is far away. \r\n\r\nBenjamin M. is a member of K-MET\u2019s health network, which gives him access to training and counseling from K-MET\u2019s larger network of providers and doctors.\r\n\r\n(Note: In the video, Benjamin says he is asking for 100,000 Kenyan shillings. But since this is his first loan, K-MET has a policy that he can only apply for a maximum of 90,000 Kenyan shillings, or about USD

She is married with 4 children and lives in a rural area where there are no jobs. Her main sources of income are agriculture and the remittances that her elder son sends from Russia. However, due to the economic crisis, for the past two months he has not sent any money. Mahabbat sold a bull and was planning to buy a dairy cow but then she realized that keeping a cow would be even more expensive. Therefore she came to Microinvest to inquire about the conditions of the loan. Having received the loan, she bought a cow. Now she already owns several dairy cows. Muhabbat is grateful to Kiva for all its support. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Oksana Buranbaeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":319240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-20T15:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":818.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084926,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":818.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T21:49:11Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108309,"name":"Ravshan","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u0442\u0430\u0436\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d 1987 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430.  \u0414\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u0425\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u0443\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u0446\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435  \u043e\u043d \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d.  \u0412 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442  \u0434\u044f\u0434\u044f.  \u0412 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 , \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0431\u044b  \u041e\u0442\u0430\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c,  \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u044f\u0434\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043e\u043a. \u0414\u044f\u0434\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u041c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.

He wanted to get a job in Russia but he did not want to leave his mother alone since he is an only son and they do not have a father. In his free time, Ravshan cultivates and sells vegetables. His mother is a teacher but her salary is not enough for making ends meet. After marriage, Ravshan decided to make his own living, especially because his uncle helps him bring the cattle to the market.

He used to work for the government Ministry of Health. \r\n<p>\r\nOn average, Johnstone sees 80-90 clients a month, depending on what services are needed. All of his clients are farmers and he says most struggle to pay even the lowest bills. He says another challenge is gaining the trust of his patients, who often are more used to traditional medicine. He is asking for 50,000 KES to purchase some instruments.\r\n<p>\r\nJohnstone's favorite parts of the practice are the curative and dental

","en":"Zuhro S. was born in 1985. She does not have a university degree. She is married with 2 children and up to now, she has been a stay-at-home mom. From time to time she was helping her mother sell children's clothing at the market. Now, when the children are no longer little, her mother  helped her start her business, also by sharing goods. In the beginning, Zuhro found it quite scary to sell at the market; her husband did not approve of this occupation either. However, with time he changed his mind and she also learned how to sell. It is Zuhro's mother who advised her to apply for a Microinvest loan. Zukhro used the loan for the puchase of children's clothing.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Oksana Buranbaeva, Kiva

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 30-year-old Aisha K. from Mbeya. She is single with two children aged 6 and 10. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans.\r\n\r\nAisha has been running a grocery business since 2006. A grocery store is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to, to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nAisha works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Aisha currently earns about $80 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase various items for her grocery store. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Aisha thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 27-year-old Bahati S. from Tukuyu. She is married with one child, age 2. Bahati has been running a business, since 2007, purchasing and selling cereals. She works at her business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by 2 family members. Bahati currently earns about 100USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase cereals in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Bahati thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":319770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

D. is 46 years old, divorced and lives with her mother and 16-year-old daughter in Arhanghay, one of Mongolia's central provinces. Her daughter is a student in the local high school. Bayasgalan runs a small retail business selling food products.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is 47-year-old Suhuda F. R. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children between the ages of 17 and 23. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting an orphaned girl. \r\n<p>\r\nShuhuda has been running a craft business since 2004. She is an extremely enterprising woman who has crafted a successful business from selling vinyagos to tourists. A vinyago is a beautiful, hand-crafted statue made from wood by members of the Makonde tribe, who hail from southeastern Tanzania. Woodcarving is an important part of Makonde life, both in ancestor worship and in their own myth of creation. These statues have three main themes: traditional masks, motifs of female ancestor worship and more abstract modern themes.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business for five to eight hours per day, six days per week. Shuhuda currently earns about 80 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stock of vinyago. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Shuhuda thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":319780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":319783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T16:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bumi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":804900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773286,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-19T13:39:44Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108580,"name":"Omolara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omolara O. is 43 years old and married with 3 children.

In 2002, together with his spouse, Azzaya, Horoldamba started to run a food stall at the local market. He began his business with 1 million tugrugs ($1 USD=1400 MNT), which has now increased to 4 million tugrugs (~US$2800.00).

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

(geretings) from Tanzania! This is 36-year-old Christina N. S. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children between the ages of 3 and 13. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting an orphaned girl. Christina has been running a grocery (genge) business since 2004. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof where general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice and dried fish are sold. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. \r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her sister-in-law. Christina currently earns about $80 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase fruits in bulk. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Christina thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":319794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":321316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase kerosine and firewood in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-19T08:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Devota ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773291,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-19T12:39:09Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108596,"name":"34-Nam Ng\u1ea1n Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linh T.

This is 47-year-old Edina K. from Mbeya. She is married with three children between the ages of 14 and 24. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent who is an orphan.\r\n\r\nEdina has been running a crops business since 1996, purchasing and selling crops. She works at the business for 9 -12 hours per day, six days per week, currently earning about $80 a month.\r\n\r\nEdina is requesting a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Edina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nThis leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":319811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T18:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edina Katyega","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773292,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T01:42:58Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108600,"name":"Ahmajon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0430\u0444\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432  \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u2013 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439  \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a  28  \u043b\u0435\u0442,  \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442,  \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442  2-\u0445  \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0412\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435  \u0441\u043e  \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439  \u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439  \u043d\u0430  \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c  \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435  \u0421\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e  \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043d  \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442  \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435  \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b  \u0438  \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e  \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443.  \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d  \u0440\u0430\u0437  \u0432  \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044e  \u043e\u043d  \u0435\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0442  \u0437\u0430  \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c  \u0432  \u0433. \u0425\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0434  \u0438  \u0432  \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443  \u0423\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d.  \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e  \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438  \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0430  \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043b\u0438  \u0435\u043c\u0443  \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439  \u0434\u043e\u043c,  \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443  \u0434\u043b\u044f  \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f  \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e  \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430  \u043e\u043d  \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f  \u0432  \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0443  \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e  \u0437\u0430  \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c.  \u041d\u0430  \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435  \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438  \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d  \u0438  \u0435\u0433\u043e  \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f  \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f  \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c  \u043c\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c  \u0434\u043b\u044f  \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e  \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e  \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430.  \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d  \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c  \u0440\u0430\u0434  \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443  \u0441  \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438  \u0438  \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d  \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043c  \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c  \u0437\u0430  \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c  \u0432  \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438  \u0435\u0433\u043e  \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432.","en":"Ahmajon G. is a young man of 28, married and has two children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":319821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Veterinary Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To increase number of chickens in her project","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elza\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773293,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T00:45:21Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108614,"name":"Ephrance's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":319842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emelia Kapange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868009,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T10:05:06Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108620,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John M. works as a driver and a mechanic at Moree near Cape Coast, which he has done since 2003.

Florida is requesting a new loan from ASKI of 10 000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the extra revenue generated to improve and expand her business. She is determined to be successful, but has patience as well. She hopes to achieve her hopes and dreams some day. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines, committed to serving the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":319847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nThis leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":319855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase fish in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T19:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emelia Mbilinyi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":402450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868011,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T10:45:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108633,"name":"Hamidi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamidi is a 56 year old woman who lives in Tyre, Southern Lebanon with her husband and their two children.
