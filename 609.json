These materials will be purchased from the large market at Sikasso.

She has 13 years of experience. Petra started working early in this business when she was only 13 years old. She started working in order to help her parents in their daily living needs.\r\n\r\nPetra worked hard to improve herself, especially when she insisted on making her own business, with the small capital she had. Hopefully she has reached a good level now and she's intending, through a loan requested from Al Majmoua-Kiva partner, to buy a new ice cream and frisco machine (smoothie machine). \r\n\r\nA Smothie (alternatively, spelled smoothy) is a blended, chilled, sometimes sweetened, beverage made from fresh fruit (fruit smoothie) or vegetables and, in special cases, can contain chocolate. In addition to fruit, many smoothies include crushed ice, frozen fruit, honey or contain syrup and ice ingredients. They have a milkshake-like consistency that is thicker than slush drinks. They can also contain milk or yogurt and a small number of smoothies do use ice cream. Smoothies are often marketed to health-conscious people, and some restaurants offer add-ins such as soy milk, whey powder, green tea, herbal supplements, or nutritional supplement mixes. Smoothies became widely available in the United States in the late 1960s when ice cream vendors and health food stores began selling them. By the 1990s and 2000s, smoothies became available at mainstream caf\u00e9s and coffee shops and in pre-bottled versions at supermarkets all over the world.)\r\n\r\nThese machines will help increase her income, especially in the upcoming summer season. Petra hopes to expand her business more and more and support every department in a special way to make all of them develop equally."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1120.5,"image":{"id":786619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy new frisco-smoothie and ice cream machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Dahieh","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-06-06T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216438912,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221603604,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226973031,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731145,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534681,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494204,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-16T08:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702305,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299246,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317207,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-07T15:36:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":305098,"name":"Joyce Wambui","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce Wambui is 44 years old.

Her brother and brother-in-law help her and she pays them a weekly wage.  They leave the previous evening's prepared dough so that, the next day, they can bake their delicious bread.  In addition, Aracely also sells fast food, soda, juice and fruit smoothies in the afternoons and evenings.  She does this from 2.00pm to 7.00pm since at that time she needs to prepare her bread for the following day.\r\n\r\nAracely will use this loan to buy flour, butter, salt, eggs, etc. for making her bread.  She will also buy meat, sausages, potatoes, etc. for her fast food business.  She has been a member of her community bank since it was established three loan cycles ago and she enjoys being a member because the loans have helped her a lot in buying what she needs to improve her business.\r\n\r\nAracely's dream is to modernize her business with new machines that will make her work easier."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":786964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour, butter, salt, eggs, meat, sausages, potatoes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-06-10T10:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracely Moncerrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":990,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504207,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668151,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036898,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797463,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608557,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562894,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-10T15:07:08Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":305262,"name":"Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lorena  es una madre de familia de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo e hijos en su casa propia, cuenta con  servicio de agua y luz, ubicado en el departamento de Lambayeque.

They hope that, in the future, he will have better life and for this reason they struggle every day to achieve their dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":666.64,"image":{"id":787036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair his taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz de la Sierra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2011-06-10T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustin Bisman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":84.15,"local_amount":84.15,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-24T07:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221642414,"comment":null},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":82.51,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-28T07:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":82.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227010786,"comment":null},{"amount":137.34,"local_amount":137.34,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-31T07:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":137.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232770242,"comment":null},{"amount":40.34,"local_amount":40.34,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":40.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238577286,"comment":null},{"amount":80.53,"local_amount":80.53,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":80.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244535092,"comment":null},{"amount":75.11,"local_amount":75.11,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":75.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250744653,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-21T08:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257540192,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-21T07:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264339769,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T01:22:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":305282,"name":"Leonila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonila is 42 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She's forty-nine, a widow, and has four grown children.  She is a storekeeper and owns a general store.  She inherited the store; her grandmother owned it, then it passed to her mother, and now it's hers.  Before taking over the store C\u00e1ndida was a dental assistant.  At nineteen she was working in a dental practice doing fillings.  After a while she took over the store completely and that's how she got to be a storekeeper, but she hasn't left the dental office, so she's got the two jobs.  She provided college educations to nearly all of her children; two of them are still finishing school.  She has the store in her house and her youngest daughter helps her operate it.\r\n\r\nC\u00e1ndida is seeking a loan to stock up the store and to buy dental supplies.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is a hard-working woman. She is a divorced woman and the mother of three children. Her family lives in Kanibadam, Tajikistan. She is engaged in selling foods and manufactured products.  She has received 18 loans from Imon International  and from the profit she opened a store in \u201cKuchkak\u201d village of Kanibadam city. She has been in this business for ten years. \n\nLaili is hoping to take out a loan of 4000 TJS for the expansion of her business so she can keep her business running successfully. This purchase will enable her to increase her sales and to earn more money. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His family lives in Kanibadan where he runs a small grocery store selling food products in the downtown area of his hometown. Ravshan's store is well-known in this neighborhood as he serves his customers well and works late hours.  The late hours are very convenient for many customers who work late and go shopping after they are done with their work. Ravshan has been in this business for 7 years. \r\n\r\nRavshan is seeking a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase foodstuff to increase the variety of his selling products. He has had some struggles as his business was growing and becoming self-sustainable. However, he handled all these challenges well and is looking toward the future with much enthusiasm and optimism.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He had a washing machine service there, and his wife ran the business because he worked in a company.  When he moved the experience of washing machine service to Malambo, he observed the surroundings and started another business.

The location is in front of the place where the municipal bus routes end.  \r\n\r\nBoth businesses have gone very well for him .  This is because he has managed to buy more washing machines and domestic appliances, which improved his infrastructure.  His greatest challenge is having little working capital.  That is the reason he is requesting a Kiva loan, which is his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the loan to buy one washing machine, a heater, one blender, and a bicycle to transport his machines.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to get his own house and to increase his possibilities in the market by offering timely services, more each time.  While this is happening he will continue putting forth his effort to keep his profitability at no less that 56% in order to always be effective in the market.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":286.83,"image":{"id":787443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"to buy one washing machine, a heater, one blender, and a bicycle to transport his machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-10T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Agustin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57372},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61027},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62197},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":63389},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64604},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":65842},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":67104},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":68390},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":69701},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71037},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72399},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76938}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.74},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.27,"local_amount":57372,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":57508.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673811,"comment":null},{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":61027,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":61171.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320368,"comment":null},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":62197,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":62344.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803491,"comment":null},{"amount":35.65,"local_amount":63389,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":63539.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614572,"comment":null},{"amount":36.34,"local_amount":64604,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":64757.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568532,"comment":null},{"amount":37.04,"local_amount":65842,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":65998.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779875,"comment":null},{"amount":37.74,"local_amount":67104,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67263.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188273,"comment":null},{"amount":38.47,"local_amount":68390,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":68552.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324502,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-16T04:32:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":305440,"name":"Ihembe Tukwatanise Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"58-year-old Norah is a food sales business-woman operating in Kihihi in western Uganda.

To finish the construction of these pens, he requests a loan from Edpyme Alternativa of 1,500 Peruvian soles, which will be very useful for his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":787594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build pens for his animals in the back of his house ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P\u00edtipo - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110.45},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":112.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.2},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":121.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125.95},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":133.3},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":140.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":147.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.06,"local_amount":212.9,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":215.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205932,"comment":null},{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":110.45,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":111.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182690,"comment":null},{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":112.8,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":114.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232779646,"comment":null},{"amount":44.08,"local_amount":120.2,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":121.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584196,"comment":null},{"amount":346,"local_amount":943.65,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":953.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542374,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-06T03:17:52Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:41:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":305487,"name":"Martha Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She has been living in this community for 3 years, where most of the inhabitants work in agriculture. Claudia has been selling shoes and cosmetics for 5 years. She is requesting the loan to invest in shoes and cosmetics because people place many orders with her, and sometimes she doesn\u2019t have the money to buy the merchandise they request. She takes advantage of sales to generate greater profit. This allows her to give better prices to her clients who, like her, are hard-working mothers and she likes to help them out by extending them flexible and comfortable payments within their means. This increases her sales, and as a result, strengthens the economic situation of her family. She wants to save a portion of her earnings for her children\u2019s education and give them a better quality of life.

She lives in her own home in the village of Picoy with her husband Marcos, 36, and their only daughter, Yulisa, who is 13 years old. Marcos and Yuliza are the inspiration for all her hard work. Through great effort and sacrifice, Carmen has been able to work her lands and make them very fertile. She grows potatoes and peas, which she then carries to the city of Tarma to sell at wholesale. Her harvests have provided enough income to support her family, which is why she wants to put everything she has into growing her business. She also works weeding the crops in neighboring fields in her spare time, for which she earns 15 soles a day. She is confident that she'll be able to earn enough money to acquire fields along the river, which will be easy to irrigate and improve her harvest. What she likes most about her job is taking care of her crops. She's been farming for four years and thinks the hardest part is taking her product to the wholesale market in Tarma, since the sacks are very heavy and tire her out. In the future, she hopes to improve her crops and earn more income. She plans to start growing flowers on her land in anticipation of November, when demand for flowers goes up because of the national holidays. She is a member of the Exaltaci\u00f3n Santa Cruz village bank, and this is her ninth loan with MFP. She is happy to know that she will have financial support in meeting her goals.
