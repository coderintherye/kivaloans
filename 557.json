is 29-year-old Sorie. He is single, and has one child aged three. In 2008, Sorie established a provisions and drinks business. He says \"I don't have to depend on anybody for assistance\" as he believes that his business is the only way for him to earn money to develop his family. Sorie opens his business throughout the week and spends about 11 hours working in his business every day. He is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 SLL to buy more provisions such as milk, sugar, sardines, margarine and drinks.

He is 30 years old, single, employed, and has a 9 year old son who is in the fourth grade.  For the past five years, Walter has been making doors and windows out of glass and aluminum.\r\n<p>\r\nWalter started working in this trade after he completed his fifth year of secondary school since he had no other way of paying for a university degree.  He left Palacaguina to find work and went to Estel\u00ed.  A cousin helped him out by offering him an apprenticeship at a glass and aluminum workshop where he started out as an assistant.  Three years later, he was able to teach other young people since there were more orders for doors and windows.  Once he worked five years at the workshop, Walter decided to become independent and start working alone.  Over time he was able to buy tools with the income from the orders he received.  Whenever he receives large orders, Walter will find assistants to help him complete the work.  He also travels outside of the region to look for new customers.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to buy materials such as aluminum, screws, and tools for his job.    This will help facilitate his work so that he can complete his orders and provide better quality finishes to the doors and windows that he produces.  As a result, he will be able to attract new customers.  Walter has future plans to open his own shop and furnish it with modern equipment of high quality, as well as hire permanent employees.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis immediate goals are to acquire sufficient materials to complete the large orders he has received.  Walter has money saved up to secure a good education for his son since he was not able to continue his own education.  He has faith that his son will be able to accomplish this.  In addition, Walter would like to have a vehicle to help him deliver orders and transport equipment more quickly.

Her whole life was spent in a hometown of Balykchy, which is translated from Kyrgyz language as \u201cfisherman\u201d. The town used to be a major industrial and transportation center, but most of its activities stopped after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Zuura is one of 40 000 people, who stayed in a town regardless of the difficult economic times. Zuura pursued a major in medicine and has been curing people for a major portion of her life. She works in a diagnostic center of a local hospital, and gets paid 2,000 soms monthly, and receives additional help of 2,700 from social fund. Zuura lives with her husband and a 13 year old son. She applied for this loan to help push forward her husband\u2019s business. It was started six years ago, when her husband invested all his return from driving a cab in acquisition of raw material for his new business. Zuura\u2019s husband is very handy and makes various types of furniture, household appliances and trailers for trucks. Business is well-advanced now and the family already opened its own workshop. It made her husband\u2019s work more comfortable and effective. The proceeded return of 8 000 soms unfortunately is not enough to accomplish all orders that he is receiving now. Therefore Zuura asks for a loan in order to purchase raw materials such as ironmongery, pipes, plywood and planks. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Elmira believes that education will open new doors into the future for her son. She says she\u2019s lucky to work at the same place as her husband. It allows her to spend more time with him and quickly solve various problems. She is employed as a janitor, while her husband is a security officer. Along with these jobs the family has livestock and resells them frequently. Four years of cattle resells has helped the family to make major repairs in the house and a shed. The revenue is usually spent on family needs and invested back in the business. Elmira and her group have know each other for a very long period, and are sure to repay the loan successfully. Elmira\u2019s purpose for the loan is to invest these funds back in her business and buy some more cattle.

Despite her young age, she managed to run the business for several years now. She found out about the loan from Kiva and was happy to tell her fellows about it. Odinakhon is single and lives with her parents, brother and a sister-in-law. Her mother is actively involved in agriculture, her father is a construction worker and her sister-in-law is a kindergarten teacher. Odinakhon says she inherited a strong and persistent personality from her mother. At the age of 17 she already knew best techniques for cultivating land and ways to get a rich harvest. At this moment Odinakhon is preparing the small piece of land that her family owns for sowing. She really hopes on good weather this year, because last year\u2019s long winters and late spring destroyed most of her cultivation. The outcomes led to a poor harvest in fall, which raised only small amount of funds. She\u2019s learned her lesson, and this year she will try to be more careful and follow the weather predictions. The history of the land goes far back to a period of fall of the Soviet Union back in 1991. During privatization, the family was given this land, which has become a major source of income for the entire family. This year she plans to sow seeds of cotton. Therefore she gathered her fellows and applied for this loan. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raisa B. is 50 years old and the leader of this group. She is a resident of a town called Karabalta, which lies on the Chu River in the northern part of Kyrgyzstan and has 70,000 residents. After Raisa got divorced several years ago, she was left with three children and a few heads of livestock that were the only source of income for the household. Now Raisa\u2019s oldest daughter is 24 and lives separately with her own family. The second daughter found employment in a restaurant in the capital. Raisa also has a 14-year-old son who is financially dependent on her and helps with the livestock during his free time from studies. \r\n\r\nRaisa has a large household with a dry shed in the back yard. She provides her sheep and cows with as much hay and oat straw as they need. The town is rich with pastures, so the livestock has all it needs for a good health. Raisa inherited the cattle from her parents and plans to leave them to her children too. Recently she resold some of her cattle for a good deal and purchased some furniture for the house. She feels very lucky to have this business, because it helped her during the hardest financial period in her life. Raisa earns 6,800 soms monthly, which she invests back into her business. She gathered this group of entrepreneurs, because each of them needs financial assistance. She plans to spend her part of the loan on purchasing a good carpet for her house. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Kiva's partner, Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Ryskul lives in a town called Karabalta with her husband and two children ages 5 and 3. Ryskul started her business career at a very young age and by this time has reached impressive outcomes. The couple has been involved in cattle breeding since they started living together. But three years ago they decided to quit this business and start something new. After reviewing the best options, and their own skills, Ryskul and her husband opened a small caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\nThe first challenge in making a business plan was choosing the location. There were too many cafes in their hometown, so they looked for a less competitive environment. The perfect spot was the busiest route in the country, connecting two major centers, Bishkek and Osh. Every day thousands of passenger buses and cars take this route. There are picturesque views and sightseeing, but the passengers complain of having a lack of places to stop for lunch. Ryskul and her husband sold all of their cattle and invested the revenue in building a caf\u00e9. It has been three years, and Ryskul\u2019s expectations turned into reality. Ryskul is the chief cook and her husband is the manager and a caterer of all necessary supplies. The family was able to buy new furniture for their house and an automobile. The profits from the business have reached 40,000 monthly, but along with it the inflation and transportation costs have increased the caf\u00e9\u2019s expenses. Ryskul is requesting a loan in order to buy some inputs and raw materials for running the caf\u00e9. If everything goes well, Ryskul dreams of opening another small shop near her caf\u00e9. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Cholpon has small assets of cattle, but believes she is well trained for this business. She believes that the capital provided by Kiva lenders will be an investment that will become profitable with good management. She purchased some cattle two years ago for 3,000 soms because she knew it is the closest of all within reach for a woman with the proper abilities and training. She is also very interested in studying the care of domestic animals. She learned that cattle require great care especially when young, good food, warm and dry quarters, particularly in harsh wet winters.

He is married and lives with his youngest son, daughter in law and granddaughter.\r\n\r\nSarsembai was born in 1953 in a simple family of a farmer with many children (five sons). His father was doing agriculture and animal husbandry and his mother was a homemaker. After finishing the tenth grade Sarsembai enrolled in college to become a driver of trucks and tractors. After finishing his studies he got a job in his hometown's collective farm as a driver. In 1973 being twenty years of age Sarsembai went to serve in the army and continued working in the collective farm after he returned. In 1977 Sarsembai got married and a year later his daughter was born. At first Sarsembai and his wife and daughter lived with his parents and brothers. But some time later the collective farm where he worked had provided him with a plot of land in his home village for building a house where in time Sarsembai has built his home and all the necessary annexes. In 1980 his second daughter was born and five years later his son was born and then another daughter two years after that. His family was growing and Sarsembai continued working as a driver as well as breeding cattle and doing agriculture. In 2006 Sarsembai was able to save some money and buy a truck ZIL which he uses to transport agriculture products and in free time provide services to his neighbors by transporting freights. Additionally he annually rents out about ten hectares of land where he grows sugar beets, barley and clover.

His difficulty is winter which is when production drops off.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy merchandise needed for his production: firewood, nacazcol seeds (source of black ink), and unbaked pots and to pay for transportation.  This investment will be of great use to him because it will strengthen the business and increase the possibility of obtaining better income thus providing his family with improved economic solvency so that his children can continue with their university studies.\r\n\r\nSantos feels satisfied with the work he\u2019s done over the years but his hope is to teach his children the art of pottery so that they will provide continuity to the business.  Because of this he strives daily to be more dedicated to his family and fights to meet their needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":725747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":" To invest in

She is the leader of an eight-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n Jessica Len is 29 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs for fattening and sale. Jessica Len has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP whenever she sells one of her raised pigs.\r\nIn 2010, Jessica Len joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Jessica Len is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be her third from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Cudog's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olga C. is from the village of Buyon, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is the group leader of an eight-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<br>Olga is 34 years old, married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Olga has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2010, Olga joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Olga is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEdwin is single. To make a living, Edwin plants and harvests  a variety of vegetables for sale. Edwin has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Edwin joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his business and living situation. Edwin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. \r\n\r\nEdwin is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be the third loan taken out by Edwin from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Having been in business just over a year, Edward has already worked with a diverse group of influential artists in the visual and performing arts industries.  As a promotional manager in the city of Corpus Christi, Edward works with talented individuals who want to move beyond the local scene to become nationally recognized artists.  Edward says that when deciding to represent prospective clients, he must see they have the passion to become \u201cworld-class working artists\u201d.\r\n\r\nEdward is a Vietnam-era veteran who grew up in a family of artists.  His father played the guitar, and his mother is a published author.  Edward sees ND Verse Independent as the natural result of his upbringing.  Studying business administration at Del Mar College in Corpus Christi helped supplement his industry knowledge with the technical know-how needed for managing the financial side of his business.\r\n\r\nEdward works out of his home, but he wants to open an office in the basement of a popular Corpus Christi nightclub.  He feels such a move could be good for the image of his business, and also keep him in sync with the pulse of the local art culture.  Edward is using this loan to cover the legal fees to transition his business from a sole proprietorship to a LLC (Limited Liability Company).  He is also using the loan to purchase QuickBooks, which will help him better manage his finances.\r\n\r\nThough he has had national and international artists request his services, he has decided, for now at least, to work exclusively with South-Texan artists.  He believes his market niche is with local artists, and that the personalized attention he can give sets him apart from his competitors.\r\n\r\nWorking with local artists  does not mean that Edward only schedules local events.  The past year took Edward to California, where one of his clients performed shows at well-known venues.  Another of Edward\u2019s clients is a twice-published author, in addition to being an accomplished painter.  This summer, Edward and this client will be making an extended tour through the Midwest and West Coast to promote the client\u2019s most recent book, as well as showcase his art at select shows.\r\n\r\nCheck out his website at

She lives in her own home together with her husband, 44 year-old Javier who is a taxi driver, and their four children.  The three youngest children are still in their care but the eldest is working and studying.  Together they work hard every day to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nFor one year, this enterprising woman has been making and selling a variety of snacks such as 'papa rellena' (mashed potatoes shaped around a filling of ground beef and fried), 'cachanga' (fried tortillas) and 'mazamorra' (a corn-based pudding).  She also sells 'chicha' (a Peruvian soft drink) and gelatin desserts which sell very well, especially during the summer.  Pascuala is very satisfied because since she started selling her snacks and drinks outside a local school her business has done very well.  The students like buying from her because she sells good-quality products.\r\n\r\nSome months ago, Pascuala didn't have enough capital to invest in her business but now she hopes to use her loan to increase her sales and profits.  She tells us that she prepares her 'cachangas' and 'papas rellenas' herself and offers them for sale to the students at a reasonable price.  As she is an enterprising woman, in the future she plans to set up a fixed stall inside a local school.\r\n\r\nThis is Pascuala's second loan with MFP and she pledges to make her repayments on time as she doesn't want to let down the people who made this support possible as it will allow her to continue working in search of progress.
