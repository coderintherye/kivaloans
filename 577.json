Due to the good quality of his services, his clients trust him and give him regular orders. \r\n\r\nShamshad is the mother of three sons. All of them are illiterate because Shamshad couldn\u2019t afford their education. Her eldest son operates a Punjabi food selling business. With his cart, he sells a traditional food called \"Golgappy\" (which is made of flour and served with spicy sauces). Her second son operates a tea stall, and the youngest one has a barber shop. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband whose donkey cart has gone rough and needs a replacement. With a new cart, he will be able to carry heavier loads and serve his clients better. Shamshad is very hopeful that an investment will bring positive changes to her husband\u2019s business and improve his income. \r\n\r\nShe is a new loan applicant and this is her 1st loan application with Asasah.

She has been very hard working from the day she joined GHAPE. Her desire is to work for her children\u2019s education and pay for their school fees so that they can be educated. She decided to become a member of GHAPE due to her inability to get investment capital, which could give her a higher income to meet her children\u2019s needs and family's needs.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy seedlings, fertilizer and manure. This will enable her to farm vegetables, corn, tomatoes, and other spices. This investment will help people in her community to have enough spices, tomatoes and other greens at a reduced rate. She is planning on using the profits generated to sponsor her children in school. She will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's school fees, and save some for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back the loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":306.25,"image":{"id":747809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seedlings, fertilizer and manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mile 90, Bamenda, N.W.

She will be able to raise a lot of profit from the business because it is in high demand in her community. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time.

She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford firewood at a very low cost, which will be used as fuel for cooking.\r\n \r\nShe will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's school fees, and save some for rainy days.

She shares three rooms with her five children in Ayaba Street, a quarter in the Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nAlice has faced difficulties in her life ranging from the inability to meet her daily needs, the inability of her husband to get a job for himself nor carry out any activity that could raise income due to an accident, the inability of her first son to continue his education due to poverty, and the increasing demands of her children. Amongst other challenges, she also has had difficulties of inadequate capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy more food stuff like rice, beans, and cocoa yams to cook to sell in her restaurant. She also plans to piglets and feed to open up a pig farm. She thinks her business will succeed, because her business site is close to the road and she is friendly, thus has many clients. Her activity will help her community in reducing the cost of transportation to buy foods in the market and their cordial relationship will give room for negotiation to pay later.\r\n\r\nShe will use a fraction of her profit to assist her husband, provide for the children\u2019s school needs, meet her personal needs and that of her family. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up and moral support given her by the GHAPE office, and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":306.25,"image":{"id":747815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice beans, piglets and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mile 90, Bamenda, N.W.

M. is married to K. David and she is a mother of two children who are both below the age of 15.  She shares four rooms with her children, and lives in mile three Nkwen, one of the areas found in the North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nM. has encountered a lot of difficulties in life, such as getting three square meals a day, ill health, and not being able to get good medical treatment. These difficulties are all because she has no money. She joined GHAPE because she had heard and seen a lot of people testify about GHAPE, and she believes her life will not be the same if the loan is given to her. She plans to buy mesh and products with the loan. She is going to use the profits from the loan to increase her capital. Her community and family will benefit from the salon because she will make them very neat. Her activity will help reduce the distance to be travelled by members of her community, and it will be available at all times. M. says \u201cher children will all be well-educated\u201d. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up, that GHAPE does not ask for collateral securities, the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan, and that GHAPE takes care of the poor and payment is gradual. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":306.25,"image":{"id":747831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

N. was born in 1960, is married, and is blessed with six children. She shares ten rooms with her six children in Nabesi, a quarter in the Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon. Taking care of these children in a polygamous home is a very big and challenging task for Esther.\r\n\r\nEsther has faced difficulties in her life ranging from ill health (operation), an accident, and theft which has crumbled her business. With this loan, she plans to buy food stuff like beans, rice, tomatoes, onions, garlic, maggi, corn, groundnuts, sugar, and cassava flakes commonly known as garri, and retail them. She also intends to buy firewood in large quantity and begin retailing it. She thinks her business will succeed because her business site is close to the road and she is friendly, thus has many clients. She has minimized risk by diversifying her business. Her activity will help her community in reducing their cost of transportation to buy foodstuffs and firewood, which will be used as fuel, and their cordial relationship will give room for negotiation to pay later in times of hardship.\r\n\r\nShe will use a fraction of her profit to buy a piece of land, assist her husband in providing for the children\u2019s school needs, meet her personal needs, and those of her six children. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up and moral support given her by the GHAPE office, and the low interest rate, investment period, and the installmental method in paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":471.49,"image":{"id":747859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Among other challenges, she also has had the difficulty of inadequate capital to expand her business. With this loan, she plans to buy more materials, buttons, thread and other materials for sewing dresses. She thinks her business will succeed because her business site is close to the road and she is friendly.  Thus she has many clients. Her activity will help her community by providing clothing close to home so that they won't have transportation costs and won't have to sew their own dresses.  Their cordial relationship will allow room for negotiations.\r\n\r\nShe will use a fraction of her profit to provide for the children\u2019s school needs and meet her personal needs. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up and moral support given her by the GHAPE office, and the low interest rate and the installment method of paying back a loan.\r\nABOUT GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":472.5,"image":{"id":747878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

Murodboy has been selling cattle for more than 12 years. This has helped him move on in his business. He is the father of 5 children who he  needs to both feed and provide with an education. One of his main needs is to purchase cattle in order to improve his business. For this reason Murodboy came to IMON International and requested a loan of 10,000 Somoni. Not only will his business will benefit from it, so will his family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Carmen is now on her fourth Grameen America loan, having used her first three to purchase beauty products that she sold to a growing list of customers out of her home.  With this latest loan, Carmen is ready to take a major professional step by moving her business to the local flea market.  She will use the proceeds from her Grameen America loan to stock up on inventory (jewelry and beauty products) and to pay the fees associated with operating a table at the market.  Carmen believes that selling her merchandise at the flea market will increase her profits dramatically and introduce her to many new customers, which in turn will bring her even closer to her ultimate goal of opening a storefront.

He started his working life when he finished high school and got a job as an assistant in a watch shop even though he didn't know the profession.  There he received all of his training.   His managers recognized his interest and inclination for this job so they connected him with a cooperative of watchmakers, mechanics and electricians.  He worked this way for 5 years.  During this time he met his wife and today they have three children between the ages of 10 and 20.  They are very proud of their children and work very hard to provide for their well-being.  Twenty years ago he decided to start working independently and opened his own business while he continued his training.  Today, in addition to offering watch maintenance and repair services, he has a steady stream of customers from the jewelers in the district.  He also sells watches and jewelry.  \r\n\r\nJavier has had two loans with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo which he has used to expand his infrastructure and improve his showroom by buying two showcases.

A., from the village of Diamantina, Cabatuan, Isabela, is 43 years old, widowed, and has three grown children. To make a living, Julieta owns and operates a business venture raising pigs for fattening and sale. Engaged in her business for over four years, she earns approximately 7000 every three months.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Julieta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies, she is now requesting her seventh loan of 15000 PHP for the same purpose. Julieta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<p>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Maricel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maricel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional ingredients to cook more dishes to sell. \r\n\r\nMaricel is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional ingredients to cook more dishes to sell. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Maricel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 26 years old, married, and has an eighteen-month-old son.  Her husband works in a factory in Manta.\r\n\r\nJohanna is a housewife.  In order to help her husband with their household expenses, she sells all types of clothes.  She makes her sales door to door though her customers also come to her home to buy her merchandise.  In the mornings, she goes out to make her sales, taking advantage of the fact that her mother-in-law helps look after her son.  On the weekends her husband helps out.  Johanna leaves her products on credit and collects payment every two weeks.  She tells us that she started her business with her previous loan and, thanks to God, it is doing very well.\r\n\r\nJohanna will use this loan to buy pants, t-shirts and children's clothes but mainly women's clothes because that is what sells the most.  This is her second loan cycle with her community bank and she likes it because her previous loan helped her to establish her business.\r\n\r\nJohanna's dream is to own her own home since she currently lives in her in-laws' home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":748417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy pants, t-shirts, and children's and ladies' clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-04-14T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johanna Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206152263,"comment":null},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211225095,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216503888,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221667831,"comment":null},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036597,"comment":null},{"amount":129.13,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":129.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797271,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-17T16:53:38Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":289318,"name":"Mar\u00eda Gladis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Los Corrales se re\u00fane cada 15 d\u00edas en una localidad llamada Los Corrales a pocos minutos de Montecristi ciudad con una rica cultura prehist\u00f3rica, en este sitio la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes tiene diferentes actividades, tales como: artesan\u00eda y comercio en general.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Gladis, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene un hijo el mismo que ya es mayor de edad pero que  a\u00fan viven en su casa.

She is 45 years old. Belinda is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Belinda F. Group.\r\n\r\nBelinda is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Belinda owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Belinda has been engaged in her business for more than 20 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Belinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Belinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Belinda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Belinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She receives regular orders from community ladies and fulfills them on time to earn an income. \r\n\r\nKhatoon lives in a small city called Khanewal in a two-room brick house with her family. Khanewal is located in Punjab province of Pakistan and is known for its agricultural industry. She has been living there for the past 35 years. She is the mother of five sons. Her eldest son sells wheat and rice, while the second one has a sweetmeat shop. Her remaining children are enrolled in a local school and are getting their education. Their education was only possible through the work and efforts of Khatoon; otherwise, their financial conditions wouldn't allow them to get an education. \r\n\r\nKhatoon has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for the betterment of her sewing and embroidery business. With the loan, she will buy embroidery materials such as beads, colored thread and sketches in bulk to provide good quality services to her clients.

She has been in this line of work for more than 10 years and earns about 3,000,000 VND a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, M. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid two previous loans of 6,496,000 VND from SEDA and is applying for her third, for 8,288,000 VND, to buy feed and other supplies.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated by this loan to continue expanding her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and northern Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been in this business for more than five years and earns about 5,000,000 VND a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, V. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid two previous loans from SEDA and is applying for a new one, for 8,736,000 VND, to buy additional supplies for her business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by this loan to continue expanding her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and northern Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been in this business for more than three years and earns about 4,000,000 VND a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, B. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business.  She has successfully repaid two previous loans and has applied for a third, for 7,392,000 VND, to buy additional supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by this loan to continue expanding her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and northern Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20203050021) is a 24-year-old woman living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. Q. is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \u00d4 C\u00e1ch 1 nh\u00f3m 04  (Nh\u00f3m 04).\n\n\nQ. is married and has two school-aged children. Q. owns & operates a business venture manufacturing furniture. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making & selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Q. has been in business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month.\n\n\nIn 2009, Q. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Q. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to expand product offerings.  She is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND, which will be used to purchase wood as material to expand her production scale.  This will be Q.'s third loan from SEDA. Q. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n1.  Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb C. (0) is a 29-year-old woman who is requesting a 7.392.000 VND loan to support her manufacturing business.\n\n\n2.  Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T. (0) is a 25-year-old woman who is requesting a 7.392.000 VND loan to support her furniture manufacturing business.\n\n\nAbout SEDA:\n\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nQ.

He works in shop which sells gifts, toys, perfumes and colognes, purses, and shoes. He has two years of experience in this business. He likes his work and he would like to develop his business. He is trying to increase his income, as he wants to start a family and to be able to provide a good future for his family. He aspires to be self-sufficient, and this is why he opened his own business. He has customers from his community and from among his neighbors. He stands out in his line of work due to his attention to detail and earnestness. He hopes to one day own a big store.

years old and works in a grocery store. He has ten years of experience in this line of work. He would like to develop himself and expand his business. He is married with five children. He enjoys teaching his children about anything he is able to teach them about. He has customers from his community and from among his neighbors. He has a good history in his business, and his last loan helped him to increase his family's income. With a loan from al-Majmoua, he would like to buy new goods for his store, for example vegetables. In doing so, he should be able to increase his income. Currently, the competition in the grocery business is creating some difficulties for Hussein.

Jamila lives and works in Tyre.  She opened a small bakery in 1997, specialized in making  manaqish (Arabic: \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0634\u200e man\u0101q\u012bsh; sometimes called \u0645\u0639\u062c\u0646\u0627\u062a mu\u2018ajjan\u0101t 'pastry'), which is a popular Levantine food consisting of dough topped with thyme, cheese, or ground meat. Similar to a pizza, it can be sliced or folded, and it can either be served for breakfast or lunch. The word manaqish is the plural of the Arabic word manq\u016bshah (from the root verb naqasha 'to sculpt, carve out'), meaning that after the dough has been rolled flat, it is pressed by the fingertips to create little dips for the topping to lie in.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Levantine women would bake dough in a communal oven in the morning, to provide their family with their daily bread needs, and would prepare smaller portions of dough with different toppings for breakfast.\r\n\r\nJamila has 16 years in this field.  She started working when her husband died and she found herself alone and responsible for two children. Jamila is a hard worker, she's a person with good reputation and all of her customers and friends speak about her good manners and her shyness. They also described her courage when struggling to prove herself in front of her children and society. \r\n\r\nJamila is working on expanding her shop through adding upgraded machines that will help increase her income in less time.  She is also willing to do some small decoration to her shop. \r\n\r\nJamila will also buy a big tent that will expand her working area, and will be used to start a new business. She plans to start a hookah cafe.  Also known as a waterpipe, a hookah is a single or multi-stemmed (often glass-based) instrument for smoking in which the smoke is cooled and filtered by passing through water. The tobacco smoked is referred to as narghile or shisha (sheesha) in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. According to Cyril Elgood, who does not mention his source, it was Abu\u2019l-Fat\u1e25 G\u012bl\u0101n\u012b (d. 1588), a Persian physician at the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar I, who \u201cfirst passed the smoke of tobacco through a small bowl of water to purify and cool the smoke and thus invented the hubble-bubble or hookah.\u201d However, a quatrain of Ahl\u012b \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b (d. 1535) refers to the use of the \u1e21aly\u0101n, thus dating its use at least as early as the time of \u1e6cahm\u0101sp I (1524\u201376). It seems, therefore, that Abu\u2019l-Fat\u1e25 G\u012bl\u0101n\u012b should be credited with the introduction of the \u1e21aly\u0101n, already in use in Persia, to India. Smoking the hookah has gained popularity, especially in the Middle East and is gaining popularity in North America, South America, Europe and Australia.\r\n\r\nThis new business will provide her with extra income helpful for her family, Jamila has been a borrower in good standing  at Al Majmoua for ten cycles.  Each loan was requested to improve a specific part of her business. She hopes to continue expanding her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1062,"image":{"id":748961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy new upgraded tools for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-04-12T11:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211153828,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216438743,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221603434,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226972861,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232730975,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534517,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494038,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702137,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257298963,"comment":null},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":106.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":106.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316905,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-12T21:32:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":289506,"name":"Hoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hoeun was born in 1978.
