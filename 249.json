He lives with his wife who supports him in everything.  For 10 years, he has been providing passenger transport services using a motorcar that he bought as a result of managing his money well.  What he enjoys most about his work is that he is independent and does not have the pressure of a boss.  He also considers this line of work to be more profitable because he generates a daily income.  In the near future, Antonio would like to acquire additional motorcars and hire another driver so that he can increase his earnings. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his 4th loan with MFP and he enjoys working with his communal bank group.

With the money she is requesting, she will buy hoses for her vehicle wash business because the ones she has now are deteriorating due to constant use.  She would also like to purchase more beverages to sell to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":356890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase hoses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-23T04:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":453.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":468.52},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":490.71},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":510.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":529.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":547.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":151.27,"local_amount":453.82,"processed_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":455.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641613,"comment":null},{"amount":156.17,"local_amount":468.52,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":470.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081053,"comment":null},{"amount":163.57,"local_amount":490.71,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":492.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997203,"comment":null},{"amount":170.12,"local_amount":510.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":512.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842547,"comment":null},{"amount":358.87,"local_amount":1076.6,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1081.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734123,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

For the past 5 years he has sold food in the evening on a street corner two blocks from his house.  He makes typical local street food such as french fries with sausages, french fries with fried chicken and eggs, and grilled skewers of meat.  His wife supports him in this business, waiting on the customers who come to his stall to try the delicious dishes.  This is not the only activity he has, though - he also has a motorized three-wheel cart that he uses to transport passengers in the mornings, something that he has done for the past 10 years.  What he likes about both businesses is that they keep him active, he is not under a lot of pressure, and the businesses are profitable, producing daily income that allows him to pay for his children's education.  He has already had 4 loans with MFP, and what he enjoys about being in a community bank is that his fellow members are very responsible and hard-working.  The money that he is requesting now will be used to buy tables and chairs, because the ones he has now are not enough for his growing number of customers.

With the rest of the money and her own savings she will buy a motorcycle taxi to start earning money that way.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Anne Kamsvaag, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":356917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","use":"Construction of another telephone booth; purchase of a motorcycle taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-23T02:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Libana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2800,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":417.57},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":438.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":456.79},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":477.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":496.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":512.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.68},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.07},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":141.68,"local_amount":417.57,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":426.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641617,"comment":null},{"amount":148.82,"local_amount":438.64,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":448.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081057,"comment":null},{"amount":154.98,"local_amount":456.79,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":467.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997207,"comment":null},{"amount":162.07,"local_amount":477.69,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":488.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842551,"comment":null},{"amount":342.45,"local_amount":1009.31,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734127,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

With the money that she is requesting she will buy more ingredients for the food that she prepares and will also buy construction materials to fix up her house, because she is concerned that she can be robbed the way the house is now.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Anne Kamsvaag, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":356927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients to prepare food for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-23T02:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysolida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":298.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":313.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":326.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":341.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":354.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":365.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100.67,"local_amount":298.28,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":303.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641618,"comment":null},{"amount":105.75,"local_amount":313.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":318.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081058,"comment":null},{"amount":110.12,"local_amount":326.29,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":331.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997208,"comment":null},{"amount":115.17,"local_amount":341.23,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":347.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842552,"comment":null},{"amount":243.29,"local_amount":720.87,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":733.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734128,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Boca Chica is known for having white soft sand, and the water is calm, clear and shallow. But tourists don\u2019t normally see those that are trying to survive in the nearby communities. Especially now in the down-turning economy many are left without employment because businesses keep on shutting their doors. Dernita has been able to survive because 13 years ago she started her own business. She sells clothes and basic food products from her house. Currently her colmado sells rice, beans, sugar and flour, but does not sell fruits and vegetables. With this loan she hopes to attract new customers by expanding to also sell fruits and vegetables. \r\n\r\nPrior to 2006, when she was still not an Esperanza client, Dernita realized that a lot of the time when she found herself out of money to re-stock she would borrow money from local lenders. The local lenders charge a 20% interest rate per week! Esperanza charges a 2% declining-balance interest rate every two weeks, 4% a month. Esperanza also helps its clients with complimentary services such as savings account, medical and life insurance, literacy courses, and business management training, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nPlease strongly consider loaning to Dernita and her group.

With MFP (Kiva Field Partner) has has had 3 loans and even though there have been some difference of opinion with his colleages at the Community Bank, Carlos remains with the same gruop because he knows these types of discussions happen. His will for self improvement and the success of the group remains.  The funds that he is requesting will be used to purchase spare parts for his motorcycle car. He will also invest in the purchase of fishing gear to use with his boat.<\/p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":357040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To repair his motorcycle car and to purchase fishing gear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-23T11:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":450.4},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":469.02},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":494.06},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":506.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":531.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":548.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.34},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.9},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.13,"local_amount":450.4,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":452.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641621,"comment":null},{"amount":156.34,"local_amount":469.02,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":471.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081061,"comment":null},{"amount":164.69,"local_amount":494.06,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":496.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997211,"comment":null},{"amount":168.9,"local_amount":506.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":509.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842555,"comment":null},{"amount":359.94,"local_amount":1079.82,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1084.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734131,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

O. is 54 years old and from the village of Puntod. She is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Delia owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling clothes and shoes in the local community. Delia has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000, Delia joined Kiva partner, PMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and for use as working capital. Delia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her fifth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

M., from the village of Anito, M.

To make a living, Nelda owns and operates a  sari-sari (variety) retail shop whose main source of income comes from selling a variety of products in the local community. Nelda has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn August 28, 2008, Nelda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI that was used to invest in expanding the business, she is now requesting a new loan, her fourth from HSPFI, of 14000 PHP which will be used to purchase more products to sell. Nelda plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her child. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mrs. Saroeun C., the village bank president selected by the members, is a farmer who owns a small piece of land upon which she cultivates rice. Because her field is currently infertile, she decided to ask for a loan to purchase fertilizer to support her field and to buy some piglets for breeding to earn more income. Her husband, Mr. Chin Norn, is a sewing machine repairer. Mrs. Saroeun C. is a 51-year-old mother of a construction worker who is also a motorbike taxi driver. \r\n\r\nTwenty-one members in this group loan are end-of-term loans and one has monthly payment loans. The former are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor,  allowing them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

A., from the village of Munsubang, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental, is a 51-year old widow with one adult-aged child. To make a living, Alejandra manufactures and sells charcoal to local businesses and community members. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alejandra joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC, she is now requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This will be her second loan from GDMPC, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

use the loan for various purposes. Mrs. Din C. is 27-year-old and the village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a small plot of land to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Rous Ry, is a construction worker. Although this couple tries to work hard, they still earn little income to support their family. In order to improve their living situation, Mrs. Din C. decided to request a loan to buy piglets to start a pig breeding business. She has three children, one of whom is attending the local school, while the others are too young to work or study. Mrs. Sok Kea C., Mrs. Saim M., and Mrs. Sok K. do not come to take a loan but their husband are, so their husband are presented in the picture instead.    \r\n\r\nSeventeen members in this loan group have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principle on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

G. is from the village of Sinayawan, Valencia Bukidnon. She is 48 years old. Rita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Rita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a rice mill. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling rice in the local community as well as at the market. Rita has been engaged in her business for over 29 years and earns approximately 30,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from HSPFI. Rita is requesting a new loan of 21,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Rita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business and pay a weekly obligation. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

He normally goes to buy cows at a reasonable price from people who live in the rural area at the frontier of Phnom Penh.

L. is from the city of Valencia City, Bukidnon. She is 40 years old. Marilou is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marilou owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a \"sari-sari,\" or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn September 2, 2002, Marilou joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Marilou has successfully repaid a previous loan from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional capital. Marilou is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Marilou from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education and supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She is 47 years old. Justina is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Justina operates a business venture in clothing sales. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling clothing in the local community. Justina has been engaged in her business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (about $105) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Justina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Justina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Justina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Justina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Unfortunately, she does not have enough money to buy fuel to support her pump, so she decided to ask for a loan to buy it for the aforementioned purpose.

End-of-term loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

This will be the third loan he has taken out with Hluvuku for this motive. The previous loans have been successfully paid back and put to good use.

Years of civil war and economic shock have inhibited residents from accessing capital and buying building materials for their homes.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing general clothing and ready-to-wear items to local community members. Alma is just starting this business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Alma joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. She is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new additional ready-to-wear items for sale. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Due to the remote location of the village, the partner was not able to re-visit the group for new pictures and an interview with a second group leader.  The original photo has been split in half and the group leader mentioned is in the second sub-group currently fundraising on Kiva.<P>\r\n\r\nThe community in Bone village usually consumes corn and cassava as their main food. They sell agricultural products such as bananas and coconuts in Inpres Market, which is situated about 37 km from Bone Village. The challenge for the community in this village is the availability of public transport to help them reach the market. The public transport only operates on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday and there is no local market available in this village so it is quite difficult for the community to sell their agricultural products.<P>\r\n\r\nKuanputun A is led by a 34-year-old farmer \u2013 Simson N.. Simson was born and grew up in Bone Village. He is a married man with 3 children. They are Dian N. 6 years old - in the first grade of Elementary School, Andhika N. 3 years old, and Alfian N., 1 year old.<P>\r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Simson spends his days cultivating the farm. He plants peanuts, cassava, vegetables, coconuts and bananas on the farm. His family always relies on the agricultural products in meeting their daily needs. Simson\u2019s wife also helps Simson by selling their agricultural produce but they only generate a meager income so Simson has difficulty covering the children\u2019s education fees and their daily needs.<P>\r\n\r\nJust the same as the other community where the people have difficulty selling their agricultural products because of lacking transportation, Simson also faces the same problem. This difficulty has driven Simson to find another way to support his family. <P>\r\n\r\nThe Cattle Fattening program becomes a preference for Simson to support his family, as it will benefit him after fattening the cattle for a certain period. Simson and the neighbors were really excited when they heard about the TLM cattle fattening program. Simson and his neighbors then decided to form a group to receive a loan so they can buy young cattle to be fattened. They are really interested in joining this program because the price of cattle is quite expensive in the market. They are sure the profits that will be generated from this program will help them cover the family's daily needs. They hope the loan will help them to improve their living standard and provide a bright future for their children.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Yesaya and Matias were replaced by their family members when the group picture was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":357299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-07-22T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kornelis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yermias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kornalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27200000,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":27200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2725,"local_amount":27200000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T08:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":27400935.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124001207,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-24T00:51:37Z","paid_date":"2010-03-26T08:02:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":124351,"name":"Seb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seb P., 42, has been involved in a business of selling vegetables at a local market in Seim Reap Province with a typical income of US $5 per day.

A1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kuanputun A1 Group is a group of 7 farmers in Bone Village, Nekamese Sub District \u2013 Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Bone Village is situated about one and a half hours drive from Kupang City. Most of community living in Bone Village have a background as farmers who depend on agricultural products to support their family life. A  small number in the community depend on husbandry in meeting their family needs as it requires a large amount of capital.\r\n\r\nThis group is part of a larger group of 15 cattle farmers. Due to the recent devaluation of the Indonesian Rupiah, the group had to be split into 2 smaller groups to keep the loan size within the limit of $5,000 per group loan. Due to the remote location of the village, the partner was not able to re-visit the group for new pictures. The original photo has been split in half.\r\n\r\nThe community in Bone village usually consumes corn and cassava as their main food. They sell agricultural products such as bananas and coconuts at the market in the town of Inpres, which is situated about 37 km from Bone Village. The challenge for the community in this village is the availability of public transport to help them reach the market. The public transport only operates on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday and there is no local market available in this village so it is quite difficult for the community to sell their agricultural products.\r\n\r\nKuanputun A is led by a 34 year old farmer \u2013 Simson N.. Simson was born and grew up in Bone Village. He is a married man with 3 children; Dian N., 6 years old is in the first grade of Elementary School, Andhika N. is 3 years old and Alfian N. is 1 year old.\r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Simson spends his days cultivating the farm. He plants peanuts, cassavas, vegetables, coconuts and bananas. His family has always relied on the agricultural products to meet their daily needs. Simson\u2019s wife also helps by selling their agricultural products but they generate only a small income, so Simson has difficulty to finance the children\u2019s education fees and their daily needs.\r\n\r\nSimson also faces the same difficulty as the rest of the community, the difficulty of selling their agricultural products inspite of the transportation problem. This difficulty has driven Simson to find another way to support his family life. \r\n\r\nSimson has chosen The Cattle Fattening program to increase his income to support his family life. Simson and his neighbors were really excited when they heard about the TLM cattle fattening program. Simson and his neighbors decided to form a group to receive a loan so they could buy a number of young cattle to be fattened.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Believing in her capacity to run the business, she wantsto be independent from all of her children.<P>\r\n\r\nCatalina has already taken several steps towards the achievement of her dreams since she joined ASHI and has the opportunity of borrowing. She has performed well with ASHI in her past loans and therefore, ASHI qualifies her to borrow bigger amounts for additional business capital. With the profit she will be getting now with her business, she will no longer depend  on her eldest daughter's remittances for her youngest daughter's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":357355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buying three

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Odildjon is 33 years old. He is married and has two children. Odildjon is a very diligent and hardworking man. With his car, he is providing taxi services. For the last 3 years, this business has been the main income for the family, allowing Odildjon to improve the living conditions of his large family. Along with his wife and children, he is also supporting his mother and brother. As any business generating income, the business of Odildjon also requires some investments from time to time. Thus, his car needs some fixing. For this purpose, Odildjon requests 1,500 USD for purchasing spare parts. Odildjon promises to repay the loan promptly and thanks all supporting him.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tajikistan:<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Eshmatkhoja is 50 years old, married and, together with his wife, they have four children.\r\n\r\nEshmatkhoja runs the family business, which is a convenience store that sells all kinds of much-needed items like oil, sugar, tea, coffee macaroni and many others. He's been doing this business for more than nine years.\r\n\r\nEshmatkhoja says that the business is going very well and is generating good earnings. And now he's planning on selling larger quantities of all kinds of drinks like soft drinks, juices and beer, since in summer demand for cold drinks will rise considerably. The loan he's requesting well help him to meet this goal.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a single mother who lives with her two daughters in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Daajinsuren sells children\u2019s clothing. In 2007 she and her two daughters moved to the city from the countryside and began to sell children\u2019s clothing at the outdoor market.  In 2009 she moved to a different market, leased a booth and started working there.  Her older daughter helps her at the market even though she is in school.   She also takes care of her little sister when Daajinsuren is away.  They hope someday to be able to lease another booth to expand their business.\r\n\r\nWith money from the loan she would like to buy clothes in Beijing and bring them to Mongolia to sell.  If she can get a better selection and better quality clothes from Beijing she can gain more customers and increase her income.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her two daughters in a Mongolian Ger.  Her husband got sick and passed away four years ago.  The property they live on has a shack on it but it is so old and run down that they can\u2019t live in it.  She hopes to be able to save enough money to fix up that shack and move into it before winter sets in.\r\n\r\nDaajinsuren is very quiet, unassuming, and a very hard worker.

2007 Sarantuya began selling groceries at the Orkhon Marketplace in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city.  In 2008 she moved to a new market and began leasing a booth there.  She recently was able to acquire one more booth to expand her little store. With a loan she will be able to buy and then sell all kinds of foodstuff instead of the limited groceries she is able to buy now. One day she also hopes to be able to get a car. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband have lived in their own two-room apartment for six years now,  with their son Undrahbulag, who is 8 and is in 2nd grade, and their daughter Indra, who is 5 and is in kindergarten.

The climate is similar to Cuenca\u2019s (variable).  She is 46 years old and married.  Her husband is a construction worker and they have two married daughters and a son who is deceased.  She relates that when her son was 24 years old, he had been drinking at his construction work site and fell a distance of 1 meter on his back hitting his head.  Because he was drunk he got up and kept drinking.  That afternoon, when he returned home, he had a strong headache.  His wife knew of his drinking problem so she didn\u2019t think much of this incident.  Later that night, he was washing his hair and began behaving in a strange way, as if he were crazy.  He was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a cerebral hemorrhage due to the earlier fall.  He died that same night.\r\nMaria lives in her own home which her daughters have helped her build upon the old one which was just mud and scrap.  She also cares for two grandchildren since their mother is out of the country.  She knits and crochets scarves which she sells.  It takes her from two weeks to a month to complete each item since she only knits when she has free time.  She learned how to knit in elementary school and what began as a hobby now is a form of making some money.  Each scarf costs her about 8 or nine dollars and she sells them for 20, 25 or 30 dollars depending on the degree of intricacy of the design. \r\nThe current loan is to purchase chicks and to build coops so that she can raise the chicks to sell them with her husband because she wants her husband to stay home more and not go out as much because, when he does, he drinks in excess.

She lives with her husband, Zacaria, in an impoverished area of Puerta Plata. Although she has no children, kids from the neighborhood love to come to her house to play. Agapita serves them food and watches them ride bikes, play ball, and run around at her house. She considers these children to be her own and gets a sense of joy from watching them grow up.\r\n\r\nAgapita runs a small grocery shop from her home. There she sells a wide variety of raw foods, including plantains, tomatoes, and a variety of meats. She will use the loan from Esperanza to buy more food and expand her business. Ultimately, she plans to purchase a motoconcho, which is a cheap motorcycle. This transportation will help her transport her goods to a market where she believes that she will be able to sell a great deal more than by selling only in her quiet neighborhood. \r\n\r\nIn addition to improving and expanding her business, Agapita plans to use her increased earnings to improve her home and take care of some of her health problems. She would like to install new windows because her house is too dark during the day. Additionally, Agapita says that she has recently experienced a great deal of tension in her heart. She would like to buy some medicine to resolve that health problem. Your loan will give Agapita the means to run a successful business and subsequently improve her life and economic situation.

She decided she wanted to turn her life around and took a sewing class in order to start her own business making curtains and bedding. Amelia took out her first loan to buy a sewing machine and fabric to start her business.\r\n\r\nNow, 6 years later, she is a shining example of how much a little opportunity can go. She frequently travels to surrounding towns to sell her well-crafted curtains and bedding which are in high demand. Now she is requesting a loan to buy another sewing machine so she can hire another employee and increase production to meet the high demand.

(far left) has created a living selling shampoo, makeup, and other Avon beauty products from her home near Saman\u00e1, Dominican Republic. Living with her husband and three children, ages 13, 11 and 8, Yessenia travels to Santo Domingo to buy the products which she sells. Currently on her eighth loan cycle, Yessenia has faithfully repaid loans for more than three years. With the support of her husband, she has seen her fledgling business grow since she received her first loan with Esperanza.\r\n\r\nYessenia, previous to her loans with Esperanza, was selling clothing to those in her local area. However, finding it difficult to sell these for a good profit margin, and due to slow sales in general, she sought to change her business with her new loan. She then changed to buying her own Avon products \u2013 the shampoo, makeup, rings, etc. \u2013 and selling them locally. This way, she gets to be flexible with the products she delivers to her customers, and is able to make a better profit margin when she buys the products directly from Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nWith these extra profits, Yessenia has been able to improve the quality of living for herself, her husband and her children. She can buy extra food and has been able to pay for unexpected medical bills. Without this financial security, sudden medical bills many times can be extremely hard to overcome, and Yessenia has been able to pay them when needed.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Yessenia first is seeking to grow her business, and to incluD. different products for sale, such as incorporating some of the clothing sales she maD. in the past and adding in more beauty products than she currently offers. With this income, she hopes to continue to proviD. for her family and support her children as they get older.\r\n\r\nThank you for this Kiva

Her two children do not depend on her anymore and have their own families. She lives by herself in her own home. Luisa started working as a seamstress 15 years ago and now runs her own business, a small clothing shop, where she also sells traditional accessories from the region. She sells women\u2019s apparel exclusively, made by people whom she hires. She likes what she does especially well because of the opportunity to meet many people. Local performance artists come to the shop to try on the clothing she sells and have their pictures taken, which is good publicity for the business. Her goal is to eventually own several stores in various parts of the city. This is the 4th loan she secures from MFP. She enjoys working with the communal bank because people there are very responsible and many have become good friends.

Now that her children are older, they help her in the store when they are done with their school work. Magui is kind and attentive to her customers, but she is also very careful not to allow them to take advantage of her. She attributes the profitability of the business to the fact that the region where she lives is very hot and there is high demand throughout the day for the types of drinks she sells.

It is located in the San Pedro de Quinego parrish, Nonad\u00e9 community, Rosas sector.  In their temple they worship an effigy of Christ Crucified.  It is very visited and well known as the Lord of the Miracles.  In this parish, the fighters were celebrities.  During Carnaval, they held the games of Pucara, which means strength.  The fight was between two rivals, who were generally very strong, but short indigenous people.  They had metal weapons, which they threw at their opponent.  They defended themselves by wearing a leather hat with large flaps, which they lowered to protect their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe members and the current coordinator of the Espoir Foundation, who was making a supervisory visit, are in the photo.  \r\n\r\nThe community\u2019s inhabitants work in agriculture, raise animals, and weave panama hats.  The people are hard working and responsible, as you will see in the examples of this group:\r\n\r\nCarmen Leonor S. C.\r\nCamren is from Quingeo.  She is 38, divorced, and has two children ages 14 and 10.  The 10 year old goes to the Rumipamba school, which is located in Quingeo.  The older helps her mother with the daily work and household chores.  She lives in her parents\u2019 house together with her siblings.  Even though they are grown and married, they still live with their parents.  Carmen, with her lack of education, says that there is nothing else for her to do but work in the fields.  She has not found other work.  She does more than farming.  She weaves hats, and after two or three days she finishes them.  Then she sells them in her own neighborhood for $12 or $15 each, depending on the difficulty in making them.  She has chickens at her house.  She would like to sell them, but she has very few.  She has asked for a loan for $440 to buy more chickens.  That way she could work more at home and not have to leave to work in the fields.  Her goals are to be able to become independent, build her own home, and be able to set up her chicken business there.\r\n\r\nEva Beatriz S. C.\r\nEva has been a member of the ESPOIR Foundation for a long time.  This is her third loan.  She is 27, single, and has a 7 month old daughter.  She lives with her siblings.  Even though they are older than she is, they continue living with their parents.  Due to her lack of education, she says that there is nothing else for her to do but work in the fields.  She has not found other work.  She does more than farming.  She weaves hats, and after two or three days, depending on how she makes them, she finishes them.  Then she sells them in her own neighborhood for $12 or $15 each, depending on the difficulty in making them.  She has chickens at her house.  She would like to sell them, but she has very few.  She has asked for a loan for $330 to buy more chickens.  That way she could work more at home and not have to leave to work in the fields.  Her dream is to be able to be a big chicken farmer and to buy milking cows.  Milk sales are good in her sector, and her parents have good, grassy fields.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Ella cr\u00eda los animales en sus casa y los vende los fines de semana en la Feria Libre, un mercado grande en la ciudad de Cuenca.

This community is approximately a half hour outside of the city of Cuenca in the south of Ecuador.  It is a group of women who get along very well.  At their meetings they laugh and talk.  If laughter is the best medicine, Mujer y Fortaleza is a very healthy group.  They also have small parties and activities among themselves for special occasions like Mother\u2019s Day.  They work well together.  After each meeting, they even take turns sweeping the house of the member who held the meeting.  The group meets every two weeks.\r\n\r\nMaria Margarita is 27, married, and has four small children ages 8, 7, 4, and 2.  Her husband works as a bricklayer.  She raises pigs, guinea pigs, and chickens at her house.  Also, she is in charge of the domestic chores and taking care of her four children.  She raises the animals at her house, and she sells them on the week ends at the Feria Libre, a large market in the city of Cuenca.  She goes to the market every two or three weeks, depending on how many animals she has to sell.  \r\n\r\nAt this time, she has few animals to sell because some chickens recently died of a disease, and some guinea pigs died of the cold.  She says this is the most difficult part of her work.  For all of the attention that she gives to taking care of the animals, sometimes they still die.  She likes the work, and she enjoys spending time with her children and her animals in her country house.\r\n\r\nMaria Margarita is asking for a loan for 330 to be able to pay a debt that she has for a piece of land that she bought but is still paying for.  She plans to build a house for her family on this land.  She will also use it to plant some corn and lettuce crops.  Her goal for the future is to have her own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

These ladies get along well with one another, spending their meeting time laughing and making jokes. If laughter is the best medicine, then \u201cMujer y Fortaleza\u201d is a very healthy group. They get together to celebrate occasions such as Mother's Day, and they are good members.

Cruz is 38 years old, married and the mother of three young children (ages 11, 7, and 4).  The eldest is studying at Fray Vicente Solano School in Cuenca, and the middle child attends Francisco Astudillo School.  Her husband works as a mason. They do not own a home, so they are living with her parents.  Her children spend time with their grandparents since Sra. Cruz works all day.  She spends most of her time in the city washing clothes, but on some days, she comes home early to be with her children and tend to the animals.  Sra. Cruz has a stable home full of happiness.  Everything that she works for goes toward the family expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe raises animals at home and sells them on the weekends at La Feria Libre, a large open market in the city of Cuenca.  She goes to market every 2 to 3 weeks, depending on how many animals she has available to sell.  At the moment, she has few animals because some chickens recently died from an illness and some guinea pigs died from the cold.  Cruz says this is the hardest part of her work.  Even when you invest much time and care into the animals, they sometimes die all the same.  Yet she enjoys her job, spending time with her children, and tending to the animals at home.\r\n<p>\r\nSra.

Two of her children are still students while the other two completed their studies and are now helping her with the business.  Her partner is a fuel salesman.  For 16 years, she has been selling food every morning.  Her business is situated outside of her home under an arbor (made of wood and has a straw roof) built by her husband.  What she likes most about her job is coming into contact with many people, and she believes providing good service to her customers is extremely important.  Her main difficulty is that she does not have enough room for her business.  She still makes good profits because she is located in a commercial area and her earnings are generated on a daily basis.

She will buy four small piglets, two sacks of feed, and supplements and vitamins for the piglets. She will also construct a small nipa hut (a hut made of a kind of palm) for her pigs to live in. She will raise them for approximately six months until they are ready for sale.\r\n\r\nIt is her dream to be a successful businesswoman. She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed while helping her family rise out of poverty.
