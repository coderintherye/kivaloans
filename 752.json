In this region, farming is one of the most common activities that residents engage in.  He works 12 hours daily approximately while his wife tends to the home and the children.  Edison tells us that one of the obstacles he faces is living in a zone that lacks roads so getting his products to market is difficult.  He comments that the community has been asking for years for a bridge to be built that will facilitate access to the center of the canton that\u2019s the commercial zone.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019d like to invest in the purchase of piglets to raise for subsequent resale.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, which is approximately four hours south of Lima, the country's capital, and hailed by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" (\"Land of the Sun\").  Ica is well known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007, and a 6.9 in 2011); its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives; and perhaps above all, as the source of Peru's traditional liquor, Pisco.  \r\n\r\nIn this hot and arid climate, one encounters the home and business of Elida Luz.  In her free time, she enjoys reading, which relaxes her a bit.  As is generally known, Peru's cuisine is one of the most delicious in the world; one of Elida's favorite dishes is \"Tallarines Rojos\" (a Peruvian style pasta in red sauce).  She only studied through the fifth year of secondary school, due to the limited economic resources of her parents.  She is married, her husband is a construction worker, and together they have two children, who are the center of her life.  \r\n\r\nElida rents construction equipment and works for about four hours per day.  She is excited to have this business, thanks to her husband, who is already familiar with this line of work.  In one day, Elida may work with six clients, which allows her to earn up to S\/.100 each day.  In a good day, she can earn up to S\/.150, which allows her to pay for expenses around the home and to re-invest in the business.  She believes that her business is going well because her equipment is in good shape and due to the good relationship that she has with her clients.     \r\n\r\nElida is very happy with her borrowers, and with this loan, she can provide them with maintenance for her equipment.  With this improvement, she will have equipment in good condition, thereby avoiding possible accidents so that, in a few months, she can save enough money in order to accomplish her great goal:  \"Expand her business\". \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":361.07,"image":{"id":973338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"To maintain equipment.

They live in the Las Mercedes area, a rural part of Santo Domingo, a canton in Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province, one of the most densely populated of Ecuador.  It is very attractive because it has various monuments throughout its capital including the Monument to the Colorado Indian in an area known as Y del Colorado.  Santo Domingo is a privileged canton with marvelous, hard-working and entrepreneurial people who struggle tirelessly for development and progress.  They always receive tourists with open arms and they take them to see the marvels of their culture and environment.\r\n\r\nAna raises dairy cows.  She buys and sells them and also milks the cows to later sell it as do all the small producers of this zone.  The obstacles she finds for this business are diseases that the cows can have so Ana also needs to buy vaccines and have the animals checked.  She wants to purchase more cows since the demands for their milk is increasing.  She plans on obtaining better earnings by selling more liters of milk although this means harder days.  Nevertheless she is happy  that she can give her son a better future.\r\n\r\nHer life is not easy but she is determined to act and give her son a better future.  Ana is an example of a responsible mother since she  has been able to get ahead on her own and now she will be closer to her goals thanks to the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":95.21,"image":{"id":973830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-01-04T23:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":620.16,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":101.61},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":105.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":109.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95.21,"local_amount":94.47,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":95.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317013,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-05T01:03:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":377947,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Martha tiene una tienda donde vende abarrotes, refrescos, conservas y otros productos para tiendas de barrio.
