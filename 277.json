from the city of Chiclayo.  Like many in the region, he makes his living from fishing anchovies, but the open fishery season only lasts one month, starting in November.  For this reason, three years ago he began a business to distribute fresh fish, an activity that helps sustain his family during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel goes three times per week to the fishing terminal of his city (ECOPHINSA) to buy fish brought in to market for refrigeration; he then distributes the fish to buyers in the cities of Ja\u00e9n and Bagua.\r\nDue to climactic and other factors, the region's fishery is in decline, which has led to increased prices for the main commercial fish species.  These difficutlies are why Juan Manuel is seeking a loan for 900 soles from Edpyme Alternativa, so as to be able to buy more product and sustain his business.\r\n \r\nIn the long term, he hopes to buy his own refrigerated container to distribute fish and transport the product more easily without paying others for this service; in this way he could save more on costs and invest additional income in improvements to his house to better care for his children and family.  Juan Manuel is a respected man in his community and considered both honorable and hard-working.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Cassetta, Kiva

trabajaba durante la noche como ayudante en una panaderia de la zona y desde hace seis meses tambi\u00e9n trabaja vendiendo pescado fresco en los pueblos del distrito de Monsef\u00fa, ubicado a 10

2-year old daughter in his parents\u2019 house, located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo in the Santa Rosa district.  The need to work to support his family led him to start a small business selling fresh fish on foot.  He usually works at night as an assistant in a bakery in the area.  For the past six months, he has also been working selling fish in the towns located in the Monsef\u00fa district, which is ten minutes from where he lives.\r\n\r\nHe goes very early to the docks to buy his fish, and then travels to Monsef\u00fa to sell his product.  He arrives home in the afternoon, rests, and then goes to the bakery to work.  The income he generates through these activities helps him get ahead in supporting his family and his parents.\r\n\r\nAlan wants to gather enough funds to start his own bakery, since he very much enjoys this activity and has been learning the trade for some time.  However, he is conscious that he must continue selling fish in order to save money.  For this reason, he is approaching Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 900 soles.  He thinks he will invest these funds into the purchase of more merchandise to strengthen his enterprise.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to buy some land on which to build his own house.  Alan is well-known and respected by his neighbors and workmates, who consider him a charismatic, responsible and hard-working young man. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn

of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHer husband dedicates himself to fishing for anchovies but, due to the times the anchovy fishing season was closed, she saw the need to work.  It was at this time that she started to distribute fish to the merchants of the area.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda and her husband travel to the Pimentel and San Jos\u00e9 harbors and, eventually, to the La Cruz cove (in the Tumbes region, located six hours from the city of Chiclayo) to buy fresh fish from the fishermen just off their boats.  They then transport their fish to the ECOPHINSA fishing terminal (the primary fishing terminal of the region) and sell them to the dealers of the area.\r\n\r\nPreviously, with earnings from her business, she started a small general store in her house that also generated income for their daily living needs.  However, her husband fell gravely ill with dengue fever on one of his visits to Tumbes.  She used the little money she had to pay for his treatment and, since then, she hasn\u2019t been able to maintain or stock her store.\r\n\r\nNow that her husband has recovered, she finds herself working with great enthusiasm to get ahead.  She plans to buy more products to help her fish distribution business to grow and to buy her own tanks (containers to store fish), since currently she rents them by the hour.  For this reason, she finds herself approaching Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to request a loan of 1,300 soles to help her reach her goals.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s dreams include finishing the building of her house and stocking her store.  Her neighbors provide very good references for her, and consider her a good example since she was able to forge ahead despite her husband\u2019s illness.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":391024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase fresh fish to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-09-19T12:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":105.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":119.68},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":127.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":144.31},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":148.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":153.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":105.18,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":105.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939724,"comment":null},{"amount":39.66,"local_amount":114.58,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":115.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780632,"comment":null},{"amount":40.7,"local_amount":117.57,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":118.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669532,"comment":null},{"amount":41.43,"local_amount":119.68,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":120.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065039,"comment":null},{"amount":44,"local_amount":127.12,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":127.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900153,"comment":null},{"amount":46.45,"local_amount":134.19,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":134.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934288,"comment":null},{"amount":46.82,"local_amount":135.27,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":135.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661928,"comment":null},{"amount":49.96,"local_amount":144.31,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":144.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694644,"comment":null},{"amount":51.4,"local_amount":148.49,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":149.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877709,"comment":null},{"amount":53.17,"local_amount":153.61,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":154.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617762,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-19T20:48:37Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138235,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Natividad tiene 59 a\u00f1os D. edad, es separada y vive junto a la \u00faltima D. sus siete hijos en el distrito D.

N. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga del sur. She is 30 years old. Fe is married and has 2 school-aged children.\r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Fe owns & operates a transportation services business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from tricycle transport services. Fe has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Fe joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to pay for registration, franchise and licenses. \r\n<p>\r\nFe is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Fe from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Sem lives in Naiotel, Taebenu Sub District- Kupang District. It is situated about 30 km from and takes about three hours from Kupang City by motorbike. The road to the village is bumpy and has not been asphalted; it is still stony so it is hard for public transport such as minivans to enter the village. In order to reach the village, people usually use motorbikes or trucks. Naiotel is a remote village; there are no local markets or education and health facilities available in this village. If a family member is sick then they bring him\/her to the local clinic which is situated about 5 km from their village.    \r\n\r\nOnly 40 households live in Naiotel Village. Most people in the village have backgrounds as farmers but they usually face difficulty in the dry season as the weather is hot and they have to fetch water from the river which is about 1 km from their houses. \r\n\r\nIn the rainy season, the community is keen to cultivate vegetables, peanuts, corn and produce coconut oil. They usually sell the agricultural produce in Tunbaun Market (about 22 km from the village) and Oeba Market in Kupang City (about 30 km). They take motorcycle taxis to bring their produce to the market. It costs IDR 30,000 per return trip. In the dry season they can not sell the produce as the farm is dry; they can not plant vegetables, peanuts and corn. In order to finance the family's daily needs, the community usually digs manganese every day to be sold. The price is IDR 1,100\/kg.\r\n\r\nSem is a married man and a father of 6 children. The children live with him and his wife. They are:\r\n\r\n-\tMarni, who only graduated from elementary school. She could not continue to high school as Sem was unable to finance her education.\r\n-\tJermi in the Second Grade of Senior High School, Sem\u2019s brother helped Jermi so he could continue to High School.\r\n-\tYanti in the Second Grade of Junior High School\r\n-\tYeti in the Third Grade of Elementary School\r\n-\tYona is 3 years old, not at school yet.\r\n-\tDina is 1 year old, not at school yet.       \r\n\r\nSem realizes that he has to find another option to improve his family's life so that he is able to meet his children's education fees and their daily needs. He heard about TLM's cattle fattening program from the field officer. He is interested in joining the program. Together with other farmers who are also interested in joining the program, they formed a group in order to receive loans to buy cattle to be fattened over 12 month period.  Sem is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,400,000 from TLM to buy young cattle. The other group members of Tnaomat B1 are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle. All of them hope to have improvement in their lives through the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":391087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Naiotel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-09-20T14:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sem","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aguetinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ferdinan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":23700000,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2475,"local_amount":23700000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":23710467.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177483717,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-27T11:03:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138245,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nMartha is a member of the Migombani borrower group in  Ilala, Iringa.

B2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tnaomat B2 is a group of eight people in Naiotel Village, Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Naiotel Village is far away from crowded Kupang City. It is situated about 30 km and it takes about 3 hours to reach the village from Kupang City. This village can be categorized as a remote village. Most people in the village support their families by farming, raising goats, pigs and chickens. The condition of the road is bumpy and stony so it is difficult to reach the village. \r\n\r\nTnaomat B2 is led by Olimpas B. - a 43-year-old farmer. He is married and has four children. They are married and live separate from Olimpas and his wife. Olimpas was born and grew up in Naiotel Village.  In order to fulfill his family's daily needs, Olimpas works as a farmer. He has a big farm to plant vegetables, corn, beans, tomatoes and chilies but in the dry season, Olimpas faces difficulty in watering his plants. He has to walk for about 1 km to reach the river in order to fetch water.  \r\n\r\nIn the dry season, people in this village, including Olimpas, usually generate income by digging manganese so they can support their families. They sell the manganese at IDR 1,100\/ kg.   \r\n\r\nOlimpas starts to find manganese in the morning and works until the evening. He works as a manganese seeker in the dry season while waiting for the rainy season to cultivate his farm. Olimpas\u2019s wife always stores up corn when it's harvest time because they usually consume it in the dry season when rice is expensive for them to buy. \r\n\r\nOlimpas saw some people who live close to his house were able improve their lives by fattening cattle to be sold. They can renovate their houses and finance their children's school fees up to High School. Olimpas then was interested to join the Cattle Fattening Program as he wants to improve his family's lives. Olimpas formed a group which is called Tnaomat B Group. Olimpas is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,400,000 to buy calves to be fattened for 12 months. The other group members are also requesting a loan as they want to improve their living standard.  \r\n\r\nNote: When the group picture was taken, Benyamin and Atrianus were replaced by their family members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":391082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Naiotel Village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-09-23T01:26:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olimpas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benyamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atrianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thobias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":26900000,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2825,"local_amount":26900000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27063463.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177483718,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-29T04:18:26Z","paid_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138247,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nFatuma is a member of the Ngome borrower group in Kihesa, Iringa.

Her parents have earnt a living working in activities associated with fishing, which is the main economic activity of the area.  Due to the difficult situation of fishermen at the moment, she decided to earn her living in another way and went to study for a career as a cosmetic technician for a year and a half in Chiclayo.  She finished her studies last year.\r\n<p>\r\nUntil a few months ago, the institution where she was studying provided her with temporary support, offering her materials to develop her profession (mirrors, scissors and tweezers) and she later started to work visiting clients who requested her services.  However, now that her parents have bought their own house and have offered her a small space inside to set up her own enterprise, she would like to buy materials that she will need for her future hairdresser business.  For this reason, she is requesting a first loan of 900 new soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n<p>\r\nGloria is a young woman who wants to excel and studied English thanks to a grant award by her institute.  She now also works giving classes to reinforce secondary education among students in her area.  Her dream is to be able to study Company Management and Gloria has made up her mind to work tirelessly to achieve this.  Once the building is finished, she will provide photos of the area inside the house destined for her future business.        <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Stephen Bayley, Kiva

She is a charming lady who rents her home and lives with her three sons, Alberto, age 25; Ricardo, age 24; and Luis, age 22, who help her very much in her work.  She runs a business renting out tents, tables and chairs for social events.  She is well sought out by customers, as her items are well cared for and her prices are reasonable.  She chose this business because it allows her flexibility and she does not have a \"boss\" to pressure her.   It also allows her to spend time with her sons and stay up late studying.  She has run this business for three years and considers the most difficult part to be carrying the heavy tents to the renters' places.  In the future she will save up the money needed to open store selling groceries.\r\n\r\nThis will be Baliba's fourth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner).  As with her previous loans, she plans to make her payments on time, because she knows that not doing so will cause problems for her community bank, with whom she has earned a good reputation for being responsible.  With this loan of \"500 Soles\" ($175 US), she will invest in new tables and chairs, which she expects to be able to rent out for slightly higher prices.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":391405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of tables and charis to rent out","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-20T05:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Balbina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997550,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":84.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842899,"comment":null},{"amount":87.15,"local_amount":249,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":252.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734474,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":86.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992428,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-20T06:23:58Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138339,"name":"Betchsabe","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Betchsabe tiene 39 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy amable y alegre, vive en su casa propia junto a sus 2 hijos, Danny de 22 y Ronald de 6 a\u00f1os, a quienes desea dar una buena vida.

With a child sent to school until college, Juliana and her husband\u2019s sporadic income is insufficient to grow their business at the same time.\r\n\r\nStarting her business with a small variety of livestock to raise and sell after a period of time, Juliana became a member of ASHI in 2001. Since she has been able to get loans, their capacity for raising more livestock has increased. Her husband has been supporting her and has been a partner in running the business. With the profit Juliana is making through her business, she has been able to send her only 18-year-old child to college, and she wishes that her business would grow more to be able to support his education through graduation.

Her husband is a tri- bike (bicycle with sidecar attached to its body) driver and has been a great partner of her not as a husband and father to her children but in the business as well.\n\nWhen Jennifer joined ASHI in 2004, she had an opportunity to request for a loan. From then and there, she was able to start having a tri- bike for public transport business managed by her husband.  Eventually, she had purchase three tri-bikes and her business had generated employment. Aside from her husband, Jennifer employed two more drivers for her business. \n\nEntering the villages of the municipality of Hamtic where Jennifer and her family live, tri- bike is the most common means of transportation for short distances. This kind of business has been a great provider of income to Jennifer and the rest of her employees. \n\nWith the loan Jennifer is requesting now, she wanted to put up a business to be run by her while looking after the needs of her family at home. In their wide verdant plane sloped backyard, she wished to build a pig pen for a hog fattening business and purchase a cattle for her cattle fattening business. With these kind of business, profit is as much double the amount of its capital after a period of time fattening hogs (pigs) and cattle.

He is married and has two children, a 5 year old and a newborn. Besides his children, he is not responsible for anyone else and is able to save 500.00MT every month. \r\n\r\nMiguel has been working as a security guard for the past 9 years, and lives at his employers house. He makes 3.500.00MT per month. In the attempt of increase the family's income, he used his savings to start raising chicken at the piece of land given him by his boss, but while the land was being reabilitated, he had to put his chicken business on hold and started selling clothes from South Africa, like pants and shirts, as well as kitchen utensils. With summer coming up, Miguel has been getting a lot of orders.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with Hluvuku and the first with Kiva, in the amount of $375, to buy more inventory for his clothing business. The two first loans were used to start his chicken business. He is confident that he will be able to pay it back soon, and then ask for another one to finish building his house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":355.34,"image":{"id":391761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-22T21:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.66,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Juliao","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":439.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":459.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":480.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":501.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":524.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":548.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":572.92},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":598.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":654.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":683.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":714.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":746.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":780.74},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":816.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":852.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.48},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.22},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.21,"local_amount":858.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":867.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971842,"comment":null},{"amount":24.2,"local_amount":645.45,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":651.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816781,"comment":null},{"amount":27.33,"local_amount":728.76,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":735.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708963,"comment":null},{"amount":28.96,"local_amount":772.3,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":779.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938009,"comment":null},{"amount":58.41,"local_amount":1557.59,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938010,"comment":null},{"amount":33.15,"local_amount":929.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":938.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.7,"payment_id":136698567,"comment":null},{"amount":64.42,"local_amount":1847.18,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1865.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.85,"payment_id":151915992,"comment":null},{"amount":86.66,"local_amount":2660.38,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2686.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.11,"payment_id":159878444,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-22T23:14:14Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138402,"name":"Amelia De Jesus","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Am\u00e9lia nasceu em Inhambane tem 30 anos de idade, vive maritalmente \u00e9 m\u00e3e de dois filhos o primeiro de 7 e o segundo de 4 anos o mais velho \u00e9 que vai a escola.Estudou ate 12 classe.

is 60 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Arkhangai province of Mongolia.  He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His youngest daughter recently graduated from college and his son will soon be getting married.  His middle child, a 23 year old daughter, is handicapped and stays at home with his wife.  Batsuuri sells water to the people of his town who live too far away from the town well. He owns two horses and a cart in which he makes his water deliveries. Batsuuri started this business in 2004 with only one horse.

is 43 years old and lives with her husband and 19-year-old son in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia. Her son currently attends a local high school.\r\n\r\nHorolgarav currently operates a meat retail business in her town with the help of her husband. She offers a variety of locally produced meats to her customers by selling at the local market. She started her meat business in 1996 with capital of 200,000 tugrugs (~140 USD). Her business has found success over the years and she has built a good reputation amongst her customers.

is 34 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia. He and his family all live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His oldest daughter currently attends university and his younger two sons are high school students.\r\n\r\nTsendbazar operates a small caf\u00e9 in his town with the help of his wife. The two rent space in a building where they produce quality meals for their customers. Tsendbazar started his caf\u00e9 in 2007 with capital of 200,000 tugrugs (~150 USD).

Davaadolgor is 39 years old and lives with her husband in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia. She currently operates a clothing retail business with her husband at a shop in her town. For her business, Davaadolgor must travel to the Chinese border city of Erlian to purchase her goods and transport them back to her shop.\r\n\r\nDavaadolgor started her clothing business in 1996 by selling her products at the local market. She quickly found success and expanded her business. Davaadolgor and her husband are very hardworking people and have used their business to greatly improve their quality of life.

Her business is very important to her as it is the only source of income for her family. Lhagvasuren started her meat business in 2005 with capital of about 100,000 tugrugs (~70 USD).  Since then, she has established herself amongst her customers as being very reliable and trustworthy and her business has reaped the benefits. Today, after years of effectively managing her business' growth, her working capital exceeds 1,000,000 tugrugs (~700 USD).\r\n<p>\r\nFor the future, Lhagvasuren hopes to grow her business further in the hope of owning her own stall at a large store. She is also focused on providing a quality life for her family, most importantly her daughter's education. She hopes that her daughter will one day become well educated and contribute to the future development of Mongolia.

For this reason, he would like to obtain a WAGES loan to buy 25 recharge cards worth 4,500 francs CFA each, 25 cards worth 2,000 f each, 120 cards worth 1,000 f each, and 389 cards worth 450 f each.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":391882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy phone cards to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Ago\u00e8","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kodjo Dodji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":38340},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":38915.1},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":39498.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":40091.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":40692.68},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41303.07},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41922.61},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":42551.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":43189.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":43837.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":44495.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45162.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.2},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.74},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.27,"local_amount":38340,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38512.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97049435,"comment":null},{"amount":87.55,"local_amount":38915.1,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T17:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":39089.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103895051,"comment":null},{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":39498.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":39676.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110783657,"comment":null},{"amount":90.2,"local_amount":40091.31,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-02T09:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40271.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118170672,"comment":null},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":40692.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-25T10:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":40875.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124009677,"comment":null},{"amount":590.49,"local_amount":262442.08,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":263620.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129038983,"comment":null},{"amount":90.05,"local_amount":40020,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":40199.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159710859,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T12:18:25Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:18:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138473,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty is 48 and married with two children ages 10 and 18.

For 7 years she has sold shoes, uniforms, cosmetics and other items.  It should be noted that she started this business due to the necessity of maintaining herself economically, given the current situation in the country.  She has always enjoyed being an independent person, since she is a young person who is capable of achieving her goals.  In addition, she would like to continue her studies, and through her own efforts she thinks that she will be able to do this.  This loan will be invested in the purchase of shoes and school uniforms to take advantage of the sales in this month of September given that now she has enough orders to fill.

Then with the earnings from that business she started to sell the natural soft drinks and has been able to get ahead that way.  The loan is for business expenses to buy sugar, bags, and fruit, since all this is necessary for the preparation of the drinks.  Her desire is to keep working to support herself.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":391976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"business supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-09-21T21:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Nellys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948652,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790707,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681225,"comment":null},{"amount":64.01,"local_amount":1280.19,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075754,"comment":null},{"amount":60.99,"local_amount":1219.81,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1253.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911765,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493227,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675883,"comment":null},{"amount":65.26,"local_amount":1305.17,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1341.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710261,"comment":null},{"amount":62.29,"local_amount":1245.71,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1280.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045613,"comment":null},{"amount":184.95,"local_amount":3699.12,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3801.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159760859,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-23T02:57:24Z","paid_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138516,"name":"Francisco Arturo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or L. cuenta con siete a\u00f1os de experiencia en la venta de muebles para cocina, sala, comedor como ser armarios, muebles para microondas, muebles de cocina entre otros, los cuales vende al credito a un plazo de 10 meses, con esto el le da empleo a dos personas que son las que se encargan de colocar el producto y el de cobrar.

For more than 18 years he has bought and sold cattle (native-born bulls and cows).  After he makes each purchase, he feeds the cattle until they reach the proper weight.  Then he sells them by the kilo to a butcher shop.  He sell the bulls at another price, given that they are more in demand for use in plowing fields in the primarily agricultural zone in which he lives.  Armando is very happy with his business, where he has learned through the years to obtain the largest financial returns in order to pay for his children's education.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan through Kiva partner MFP, with whom he is very comfortable.

Consequently, working together with her spouse, they have managed to have profitable crops and have used their earnings to pay for their daughter\u2019s education in Lima (capital city), including room and board. Irene sells her products in the city\u2019s wholesale market, where every Wednesday afternoon (during the crop season) she sells the biggest potatoes for about 30 to 50 soles per sack; she keeps the medium-sized potatoes, hoping to sell them to other buyers visiting from coastal areas. Irene likes to plant this tuber because in spite of the high investment required, she always recoups it and makes a profit; she has been saving to buy more potato fields. This is her fifth loan with MFP, encouraging a personal commitment and advising her fellow group members to continue making payments on time, since she is also the treasurer of the community bank. She is thinking of investing her loan in buying chemical fertilizers and fungicides for her next potato crop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":392167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buying fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-22T04:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717288,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-22T10:46:31Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":138552,"name":"Maebell","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maebel E., 23 years old is a young farmer in Veruela Agusan Del Sur.

P. is from the village of Dinas, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental. She is 51 years old. Veronica is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Veronica owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting sugarcane for sale. Veronica has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from this activity.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Veronica joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Veronica has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. Veronica is now requesting a second loan in the amount of 7,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase fertilizers. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has eight children, but one passed away recently. Victoria raises pigs and cattle, but while in mourning, she wasn't always able to feed and care for her animals. Fortunately, time has helped to lessen her grief and she has returned to her work. She fattens pigs for six months, then takes them to be sold at a butcher shop in the city. When one of her cows has been bred, Victoria gets as much from the milk as she can. She makes delicious cheeses and sells them wholesale to merchants.

As soon as she got married, she started raising a cow and found this occupation most suitable for herself. She even managed to convince her husband to be engaged in the same activity. Now, her husband as well, is occupied with breeding cows. He brings the cattle home and also milks them and helps his wife turn in the milk. They manage to daily turn in 32 liters of milk, which brings them $140 each month. This is not a big sum. Nevertheless, they have been able to buy convenience goods, a wall unit and to conduct periodic repair of their house. They have three children, who live with their own families. The children received a good upbringing from their parents, and started their married lives quite early. Nadejda has applied for this loan to buy hay for wintertime for her cows. She has a dream to have a car. But before purchasing a car, she is going to finish the repairs to her house and increase the total population of her livestock. \r\n\r\nThese are Nadejda\u2019s partners: Gulbaiyas, Raifa and Alexandra. \r\nGulbaiyas, 46, is married and has two children. Her daughter goes to college and works as a saleswoman in a grocery store. Gulbaiyas\u2019s husband is a driver. As for herself, she sells milk and works in the field. Gulbaiyas is in need of a loan for harvesting barley, corn and wheat. \r\n\r\nRaifa, 54, is divorced. She has one son, 28, who works as a shepherd. He also milks cows and sells milk. Raifa works as a controller, but she manages to save time to help her son milk cows and sell milk. She needs a loan to purchase hay for wintertime. \r\n\r\nAlexandra, 57, has one son. Her husband works as a metal worker and her son sells chewing gum, distributing them by his own car. Alexandra works as a mail carrier and she also keeps cows and sells milk. Therefore, she needs a loan to buy hay for wintertime.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

D. is from the village of Sinonoc, Sinacaban, Misamis, Occidental. She is 52-years-old. Cornelia is married and has one school-age child. Cornelia owns and operates a \"tuba\" retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products in the local community. Cornelia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cornelia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cornelia is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Cornelia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Virgie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Virgie from GDMPC.

M. is from the village of Mialem, Jimenez, Misamis, Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising cattle for sale. Esperideon has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Esperideon joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Esperideon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals. Esperideon is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Esperideon from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

G. is from the village of Malangka, Gingoog City, in the Philippines. She is twenty-four years-old and married with three young children. Marites owns and operates a mini-restaurant called a \"carenderia\".  While not the only revenue generator, the main source of income for the business comes from serving a variety of different meals to local customers. Marites has run her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month from it.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marites from HSPFI. She plans to save the additional revenue generated from the business as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

firm believer that \u201cthere\u2019s wealth beneath the garbage\u201d, Chinita G. is a 48-year-old garbage collector in Malibay, Pasay City.  She lives with her husband Eduardo, 54, an equally hardworking garbage collector.\r\n\r\nChinita and her husband have been a garbage collectors for more than twenty years.  She scours the village streets riding on her pedicab (rickshaw), collecting each household\u2019s rubbish.  Her husband does the same routine in other areas.  Before they dump everything at the city\u2019s waste disposal facility, they salvage anything of value, such as paper, bottles, and scrap metals, and sell these to buyers who in turn sell them to foundries and large junk shops.  After her daily garbage collection, she tends her ukay-ukay store (used clothing).  She earns more than P13,000 per month from these activities.\r\n\r\nChinita joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2006.  This time, she has applied for a new P20,000 loan with CCT to purchase parts for the repair of her pedicab, and for her used clothing business.\r\n \r\nIt has been Chinita\u2019s long sought-after dream to have her own house and business lot, including her own junk shop.  She also hopes that with her and her husband\u2019s combined hard work, their children would be able to finish their studies. \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents

F., 36, has been with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative since 2002 but embarked on establishing a hardware store only five years ago.  Her husband Rogito, 39, is a plumber.  All their four children are in school.  They live in Maricaban, Pasay City.\r\n\r\n<p>Julita sells small spare parts for bicycles and motorcycles, as well as small industrial supplies. Her store is not large but since it is located on one of the city\u2019s busy streets she is always busy attending to customers. She laments that she can\u2019t have quality time with her children anymore, so she has hired two assistants to tend to customers. Julita now earns a net income of close to P300,000.00 a month.\r\n\r\n<p>Her loans from the cooperative and profits earned from her business have helped her to expand her store. She was also able to buy a family vehicle. In the future, she hopes to be able to establish another store in a different location. Julita is now teaching her children the value of hard work at a young age, as she wants them to inherit her business skills.   \r\n\r\n<p>Julita is currently applying for a loan in the amount of P50,000.00 for the expansion of her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>About CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

Naranbaatar started his ger material and furniture production business in 2004 with the support of his father. His father, an experienced craftsman, taught him all the techniques and skills needed to make wooden products. However, after suffering a stroke, his father had to give up the trade and currently doesn't work. When he started, they  produced furniture based on customer orders, but now take orders and produce furniture for sale at the shipping container. For the future, Naranbaatar hopes to continue to grow and expand his business. He says, \"With the growth of my business, I hope to take care of my parents as long as I can.\u201d.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Lucia has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Lucia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. Lucia is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Lucia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

S. is from the village of Danao. She is 22 years old. Gracel is married. To make a living, Gracel owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Gracel has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Gracel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gracel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Gracel is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Gracel from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Danao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Merna has been engaged in her business for over 27 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Merna joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Merna is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase a fishing boat. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Merna from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
