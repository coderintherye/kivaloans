The main source of income for the business comes from providing transportation services to local community members. Cristine has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cristine joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to repair the shield of her \"motorcab,\" a motorcycle with a cab. Cristine is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service such as tires and interiors. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Cristine from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her house. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is from the village of Kabayan, Kadingilan Bukidnon. She is 32 years old. Efril is married and has 2 very young children. To make a living, Efril owns & operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling fish in the local community. Efril has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Efril joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Efril has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase more fish to sell and as working capital. Efril is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Efril from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jocelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Macapari, Damulog Bukidnon. She is 42 years old. Jasmin is married and has 6 children. To make a living, Jasmin owns & operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling charcoal and firewood in the local community. Jasmin has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jasmin joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jasmin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional working capital. Jasmin is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase coconut shells for charcoal processing, to be sold subsequently. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jasmin from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She has a daughter, Doris, who is 34 years old.\r\n\r\nPola is a member of the communal bank \"Lotan Bajo,\" which is located 30 minutes from the town of San Miguel.  There are 13 members in all, and the majority of them work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nPola works in agriculture to provide a source of income for her family.  She cultivates corn and beans.  In the house, Pola also does sewing work.  She sells her products and also makes her purchases in the San Miguel market.\r\n\r\nPola requests a loan to buy fertilizers and other products for agriculture.  She thinks that this loan will help her to improve the economic situation of her family.  Her goal is to improve their house, and to buy seed that is certified for better production so that she can get better prices for her products.  The challenges she faces are the lack of money to buy supplies and a lack of labor.\r\n\r\nPola says that the customs of her canton are the fiestas of Patr\u00f3n San Miguel and their carnivals.

of the Ca\u00f1ar county. This town enjoys a lot of sunshine, thanks to its geographical position: on the eastern side, from the church of the Franciscan Sanctuary, we can in fact appreciate big slopes descending towards the bed of the Burgay river, while the south-north axis is draped by short planes that have allowed the settlement and development of the urban outline, with relevant paths and adjustments giving the town a beautiful look during daylight hours, and thus creating strong contrasts emphasizing its urban-architectural layout.\n\nBlanca is in her third cycle with the foundation: she was introduced to us by a friend that no longer belongs to the bank. She sells lottery tickets, working from 9 am to 7 pm. Through this activity she has succeeded in getting by with her family.\n\nBlanca is 47 years old and separated from her husband two years ago.

These activities are the main source of income for his family.  The two products he sells the most are cattle and corn.  He acquires his products in San Miguel and also sells in both San Miguel and Guaranda.  Jaime is requesting a loan to use for farming and to increase the operating capital for his business.  He believes the loan will help his business so that he can buy and sell products.  His dreams include upgrading the model of his car and buying a plot of land.  The main challenge he faces is overproduction since his products can only be sold at lower prices since there are not enough buyers.\r\n<p>\r\nJaime enjoys spending time with his family.

(In the photo she is in the center of the back row in a purple sweater.) She runs a bookstore out of her home, where she sells school supplies and offers photocopying and printing services.  She also has two computers for clients to use, one of which has an internet connection. She will use her portion of the loan to buy notebooks, pens, and reams of paper to sell to her customers. Katherine\u2019s dream is to expand her business into the upper floor of her home, and she is currently working with the municipality to get the permits needed to make this happen. One reason why she works so hard is to provide for her three children, who are 13, 12, and five years old. Katherine enjoys working with Fondo Esperanza because of the trust the organization has had in her, as seen in its willingness to give her a loan with minimal prerequisites.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lakeside spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live; some are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n\r\nVersi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol:\r\n\r\n Este banco comunal es llamado \u201cConfines del Sur\u201d y es la 2\u00ba vez que se publica en el sitio de Kiva.

She is 42 years old and is one of 8 members of the Santa Rosa D. Yanacoto group comprised of members that engage in various types of work. Carmen began selling AVON products (beauty products such as perfume, talcum powder and cologne). It took approximately 1 year for her to gain customers, during which time her income improved, and needing to buy products to sell, she had the opportunity to participate for the first time in Edaprospo, through a friend. She invested her first loan in buying more AVON products. She now sells food, sweets and sodas at a place she rented in a College of Education. Like with all business, she started with small quantities of merchandise, but her income soon improved due to regular sales.  This current loan will be invested in the purchasing of merchandise: 3 cases of soda, boxes of cookies, candy, gum, sausages and boxes of yogurt.  She has in mind plans to open a restaurant in an area where the public passes by and of course to offer a better life to her children.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jacqueline

Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Auxiliadora is a 24-year-old entrepreneur who lives in Turrialba, Cartago, a tranquil mountainous region located near the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Auxiliadora lives with her sister and mother in an annex of the store which the family has been renting over the past 2 months. Auxiliadora and her 21-year-old sister, Angelica, have 5 years of experience managing  a store in San Jose; however, they have recently moved to Turrialba as a result of the separation of their mother and father. \r\n\r\nThe sisters have been working tirelessly from 5:30 AM to 7:00 PM Monday to Sunday in their new store to get it off the ground. Auxiliadora says her sister is better with numbers, so Angelica does all the calculations and determines the prices of products. Although this loan is in Auxiliadora\u00b4s name, the two really work as a team, and Angelica will have significant input into how this loan will be used (especially since she\u00b4s so good with numbers).\r\n\r\nIn their store, the sisters offer everyday products that you might find at your average corner store: instant soups, potato chips, juices, ice cream, kitchen appliances and milk, among other products. As you can see in the picture, inventory levels are low. Auxiliadora and her sister plan to use this loan to invest in more inventory and also to purchase a fridge to keep refreshments cool. \r\n\r\nAuxiliadora\u00b4s short-term goal is to make the store more profitable, increase income and improve living conditions for her family. The income generated from the store's sales combines with the monthly salary that her mother earns as a domestic worker, which amounts to 90,000 colones (180 USD,) as the family's only sources of income. Rent is 30,000 colones per month, not including electricity and water costs. With respect to the store, Auxiliadora hopes to earn enough profits in order to one day be able to purchase the store and the house the family is currently renting (the house and store are attached). \r\n\r\nBoth Auxiliadora and her sister are taking night classes, 3 hours every day, in order to complete high school. When they aren\u00b4t busy managing their store, they do their homework. The sisters hope to graduate from high school within the next 3 years. Angelica mentioned she would like to go on to university and study accounting.\r\n\r\nAuxiliadora and her family face some challenges. The rent payments have become difficult to make, as a result of low sales levels as of late. Auxiliadora is confident that this loan will give her the injection of working capital she needs to turn the store into a better income-generating activity. Another obstacle has been local groups who attempt to break in and rob the store at night. The sisters don\u00b4t seem deterred by the robbers, though. Auxiliadora says \u00a8we have 2 dogs and an alarm, and the police come if the alarm goes off.\u00a8\r\n\r\nWhen asked if they enjoy this type of work, the sisters both replied yes. Angelica says, \u00a8it\u00b4s better to work for ourselves.\u00a8\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":545876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

When Luis was young, his father had a butcher shop and all the sisters and brothers worked there.  Since it was a family business, they all learned how to manage a it.  When they all grew up, they, including Luis, invested their savings in meat to sell. Now the butcher shop is the main income for his family. He works there from 7 am until 8 pm, selling beef by the pound at $2.20, pork at $2.00.  But to give a better life to his children he wants to build his house better, buying iron and cement for the construction.  In the future we wants to buy meat cutting machines for the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

The loan is to buy equipment such as disks, replacements and parts for the video games.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emma Felten, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":545938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.33,"local_amount":506.68,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":538.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152046450,"comment":null},{"amount":25.74,"local_amount":514.87,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":546.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761649,"comment":null},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":502.39,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":533.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848615,"comment":null},{"amount":25.63,"local_amount":512.61,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":544.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256557,"comment":null},{"amount":25.59,"local_amount":511.72,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":543.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802554,"comment":null},{"amount":24.69,"local_amount":493.73,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T10:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":524.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956393,"comment":null},{"amount":25.34,"local_amount":506.73,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":538.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188685517,"comment":null},{"amount":24.89,"local_amount":497.77,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":528.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191424679,"comment":null},{"amount":97.67,"local_amount":1953.5,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2075.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195843676,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-27T20:33:11Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:41:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":203684,"name":"Bricy Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nBricy es una madre de familia de 29 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposo y sus dos hijos en el distrito de Paij\u00e1n, provincia de Ascope, en la regi\u00f3n La Libertad, ubicado a dos horas y media de la ciudad de Chiclayo, capital de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque.\n\nSe dedica desde hace m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o a la venta de productos de primera necesidad y abarrotes.

She has a business selling clothes at the municipal market in the city of It\u00e1. She says she started the business more than three years ago and that she previously worked in sewing, and used the little capital she made to start her business. Currently, she has a variety of merchandise she works with day to day to make headway for all of her family. She has decided to turn to Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya and request a loan to purchase more merchandise because demand is high right now for winter clothing (jackets and sweaters) because of the season. Elena is thankful for the loan because it allows her to satisfy all her customers' demands.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

T. is 37 years old and married. She has 6 children, ages 13 - 25.  She owns a business catching and selling farm-raised fish. Palolo has 3 years of experience in this business.  Palolo needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fish to sell. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Palolo joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan from SPBD. SPBD's loans are Palolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan from traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

O. is from the village of Panadtalan, Maramag Bukidnon. She is 30 years old. Margelyn is married and has 1 infant-aged child . To make a living, Margelyn owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food and daily use products in the local community. Margelyn has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Margelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Margelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to  purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Margelyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Margelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Losalina joined SPBD. This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Losalina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as to Tonga.

I. is 35 and married with three children (ages 3 - 8).  She owns a business selling fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam.  Fili has one year of experience in this business.  Fili needs a loan of WST $1,000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fili joined SPBD.  This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fili's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as to Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 50 and married with nine children (ages 12 - 30).  She owns a business selling rice products in the local community.  Mamele has one year of experience in this business.  Mamele needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mamele joined SPBD.  This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Mamele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as to Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She plans to use the earnings from her business, estimated to be 300 talas (approximately USD 120) per week, to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sasa joined SPBD and this is her first loan. SPBD's loans are her only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and, since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join  SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates about

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Agustina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

F. is 39 and married with one child.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Avatea has many years of experience in this business.  Avatea needs a loan of WST$ 2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US$ 250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Avatea joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Avatea's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

O. is 27 and married with one child.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Asotasi has one year of experience in this business.  Asotasi needs a loan of WST$ 1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US$ 208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Asotasi joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Asotasi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

To make a living, Rosita owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Rosita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Rosita is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Rosita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is a 64-year-old married woman who lives in the village of Gil Montilla in Sipalay City in the province of Negros Occidental. She earns her living through her general store and through farming. Vicitation's husband, David, is a farmer. They have seven children. Six of their children already have their own families, and only one child is single and works to help the family.\r\n<p>\r\nVicitation joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999, in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a general store business and by farming. Now she earns an average monthly income of 15,500 PHP from her business activities.\r\n<p>\r\nVicitation is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and her family's living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 16th loan, a loan in the amount of 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use for her general store and for farming. Vicitation is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide her family with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than 1 USD a day by achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":545357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"As additional

To make a living, Esmeralda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Esmeralda is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Esmeralda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Esmeralda is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Esmeralda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is from the village of Brgy.San Nicolas, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 53 years old. Adora is widowed and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Adora owns and operates a business venture in the services sector providing transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating motorcycle transport services. Adora has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 5200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Adora joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Adora is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to repair her existing vehicle in order to provide better service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Adora from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Little Tadian. She is 38 years old. Violeta is married and has eight young children. To make a living, Violeta raises livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Violeta has been engaged in her business for more than one year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Violeta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Violeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Violeta is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Violeta from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Zaituni had to improve her customer relationship skills. It was thirteen years ago when she came to terms with this fact. Since then her hotel (restaurant) business has obtained a firm footing in the heart of Jinja.\r\n\r\nBefore enforcing these measures to give her business a new lease of life, Zaituni\u2019s business was fraught with all sorts of image problems. This was mostly due to the fact that most of the workers she hired had minimal training in good customer care. At length, this married mother of five buoyant children has never lived to regret her decision to train all her workers.

B. is a 33-year old married woman who lives in So. Dag-it, Brgy Okiot, Bais City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by engaging in a general store and fish vending businesses.\r\n\r\nGilvenia\u2019s 40-year-old husband, Alexander, is a fisherman.  They have 2 children who are 10 and 13 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nGilvenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and fish-vending businesses. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 19,500 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nGilvenia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund the operations of her general store and fish vending business, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 10th cycle loan in the amount of Php 15,000, which she intends to use on her general store and her fish vending business. Gilvenia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family: to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":540014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

S. is a 38-year-old married woman who lives in Brgy. Mabuhay Sta Catalina Negros Oriental. She earns her living by buying and selling coconuts and by fishing.\r\n\r\nMarivic\u2019s husband Lowim is a fisherman, and they have 2 children who are currently going to school and who also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nMarivic joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in buying and selling of coconut and fishing. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 6,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMarivic is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 19,000 was used to fund the operations of her fishing and buying and selling of coconut, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing, for her 7th cycle loan, the amount of Php 15,000, which she intends to use to add to her working capital.

She is wearing a multicoloured jacket and waving her hand in the photograph. She is a reliable customer of the Malaika credit association, and is a 57 year-old widowed mother of four. Her two daughters and two sons are all married and have their own homes. Yalala lives in the popular Nyabushongo quarter, a shanty town in Goma, in the Karisimbi region. Her husband passed away in 2008, following a short illness. \r\n\r\nRutuku is a 47% strength alcoholic beverage, made up of a solution of manioc flour fungus, corn, sorghum etc, heated to over 180 degrees centigrade through a vase that is joined to a locally-designed chimney pipe. The refined condensed droplets are collected in a bowl and cooled to give the taste of strong whisky. Yalala began this business with her own money in 1984. She borrowed all the ingredients for Rutuku (corn, flour, firewood etc) from friends and acquaintances that she paid back after completion - this was a way of kick-starting and taking charge of her work. Given the costs of family demands and single life, it has been difficult for her to grow her business. However, with a loan from the Hekima microfinance association, she has discovered a social and financial equilibrium. Yalala says that she has already completed several family projects (the purchase of 2 plots of land, the construction of two houses, and supporting her children in their homes, as a supportive parent should do, amongst other projects). Yalala remains ambitious, despite being widowed, and aims to buy a large plot of land in a VIP quarter, like Himbi, Keshero, the Volcanoes etc. With a Hekima loan, Yalala wishes to increase her business revenue and buying two bags of corn, four bags of manioc flour and two heaps of firewood. \r\n\r\nShe explains that the main difficulty of producing this drink is down to credit sales and the scarcity of firewood (since the State has begun to clamp down on those who destroy the environment, such as sellers of wood from national parks). Furthermore, sometimes when the ingredients do not mix properly, a different liquor forms, and regular customers refrain from buying it. Given her advanced age and the difficult production process of this drink, Yalala wishes to modify her business activity, by also selling general products from her home. \r\n\r\nYalala wishes to thank Hekima for the loans that she receives without any material guarantee, as thanks to these loans she can see to the needs of her children and grandchild. She recognises Hekima as the local bank that will support her, as she no longer has a mother, father, nor husband.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Dr. Marysia K. and the Kimanga Group.  Marysia is 37 years old, married, and has a three-year-old daughter. Marysia studied to be a doctor, but before she started practicing medicine, she gave birth to her daughter who was premature.  She decided to stay home and care for her baby.  While at home, she decided to start her own catering business, which she did shortly after her daughter's birth.  \r\n\r\nWith a small amount of money from her husband, Marysia began buying some catering supplies and offering her services for events such as weddings and kitchen parties.  In 2009, her friend introduced her to Tujijenge Tanzania, and Marysia has now had three loans.  With the previous loans, Marysia bought tablecloths and fabric for decorations, serving dishes, buffet tables, plates, a charcoal cooker, and a gas cooker.  This has allowed her to grow her business, which now employs 8-10 staff.  Profits vary depending on the number of events Marysia caters, but can be up to 3,000,000 Tsh per month (about $2100).  \r\n\r\nThis is Marysia's first Motisha loan. A Motisha loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that allows borrowers with good credit ratings to pay back their original loans faster and receive extra money before their original loan term has ended.  Marysia has some big events coming up, and she will use this loan to buy extra drinking glasses and fabric for decorations.  Marysia dreams of growing her business and if she makes a profit from this loan, she will save to buy a music system, and someday to make a trip to China to buy more catering and decoration supplies. Marysia also recently started working as a medical doctor during the week, and greatly enjoys her two different types of work. \r\n\r\nMarysia is the President of the Kimanga Group.  The 10 group members will hold each other accountable for repaying the loan. In the photo, Marysia is the middle of the back row, wearing a striped polo shirt.

Rukia is 44 years old, married and has three children ages 10, 15 and 22 years old.  All of her children go to school.\r\n\r\nFor 16 years, Rukia has been running a clothing business.  She started out selling used clothes, but has grown her business and now she sells madila, which are long embroidered robes often worn by Muslim women in Tanzania.  Rukia works from 9 am until 6 pm each day and earns a profit of about 400,000 Tanzanian shillings ($270) per month.\r\n\r\nShe used her first loan from Tujijenge to increase her stock of madila and will use this loan to buy garments from Mombassa (Kenya) and India.

Ismail is 30 years old and has two small boys. They go to school and so does Ismail's 16-year-old younger brother who he supports.  For the past 9 years, Ismail has run a small business selling cakes and renting decorations for weddings and other events.  He starts work around 8am and can work as late as midnight if he needs to collect his decorations from a party.  Ismail's profit varies depending on the number of events he services, but it can be as much as 400,000 TSH a month (about $270). He will use this loan to purchase decorative light bulbs and cloth to improve the selection of products that he can rent.  Ismail will save any profit from this loan so that he can buy more decorative equipment and a car, which will help him transport the rental equipment more easily.  Eventually Ismail would like to build his own house.\r\n\r\nIsmail is the President of the Lukundo Group, which means love in Kipale, one of the many indigenous languages spoken in Tanzania.  The group's members run a variety of businesses such as a saloon, a caf\u00e9, and sales of food, charcoal, clothes and hardware.  They will hold each other accountable for paying back this loan.  \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Ismail is standing in the back row wearing an orange shirt.

Lauben is a 32-year-old happily-married father of four children who has run a salon business for five years in Ikula, Mubende. With all his efforts, he has been able to maintain it earning him 100,000 Ugandan shillings a week.
