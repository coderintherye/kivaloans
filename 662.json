She is the owner of a general store that sells food products, household items, firewood, charcoal, and also has video game machines available for customers to play. She began her business 9 years ago by selling small goods.  Her business has prospered and she has been able to expand the merchandise.  A large part of her success has been because of serving a large number of dedicated customers.  When she first began to sell charcoal and firewood she had to learn to drive, so she would be able to transport the new products to her store.  \r\n\r\nHer store is located in a leased location close to her home.  She buys the majority of her products from wholesalers in Temuco.  She will use the loan from Fondo Esperanza to buy merchandise for her store, as well and charcoal and firewood.  Her dreams are to continue to grow her business and have a building of her own so she no longer needs to rent space.  She has started with plans to construct a store as part of her house and is currently working on the details.  \r\n\r\nRoxana is married and lives with her husband and two children.   Her daughter is 22 years old and studying to be a legal assistant, while her 15 year-old son is currently in high school. Another one of her dreams is to continue to expand her business so she can provide economic stability for her family and improve their quality of life.  \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the services provided by Fondo Esperanza.  She enjoys the Communal Bank meetings and the other members and she feels there is trust and commitment to each other. As part of the training provided by FE she has learned to record her expenses and income, which has improved the organization of her business.  \r\n \r\nTemuco is the capital of the region of Araucan\u00eda. The city is located 670 km south of Santiago (the capital of Chile). There are a number of lakes (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica) located nearby Temuco, as well as parks filled with striking fauna and flora. 50% of the Mapuche indigenous population also lives in this region.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":859795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase merchandise, coal, and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-08-31T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":531062,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":60199},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":63522},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64736},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":65505},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":67602},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":68515},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":69824},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71159}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.85},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":408.1,"local_amount":188457,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":190541.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795995,"comment":null},{"amount":288.24,"local_amount":133107,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":134579.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606916,"comment":null},{"amount":299.57,"local_amount":138339,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":139868.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561284,"comment":null},{"amount":154.09,"local_amount":71159,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71945.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772279,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-04T18:26:35Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":331601,"name":"Ang\u00e9lica Yomaira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ang\u00e9lica de 23 a\u00f1os vive en una localidad suburbana con caminos de tierra (Fort\u00edn en Guayaquil), decidi\u00f3 empezar haciendo comida para vender ya que en la zona no hab\u00eda competencia para ella.

Desde entonces pr\u00e1ctica t\u00e9cnicas agr\u00edcolas que no da\u00f1an el medio ambiente. Estos conocimientos los est\u00e1 transfiriendo a sus hijos para que sigan su ejemplo y a la vez ense\u00f1ar a conservar el medio ambiente. Su producto es reconocido en su comunidad, por la buena calidad que tiene consigo, es por ello que los grandes mayoristas llegan a su parcela para comprar su producci\u00f3n a un precio competitivo, por tanto recibe buenas ganancias. Usualmente ella trabaja con su pareja, pero en ocasiones recibe la ayuda de sus hijos, pero en temporada de cosecha necesita de peones para que lo facilite la extracci\u00f3n de sus productos. En un futuro desea incrementar su campo agr\u00edcola, con la necesidad de ganar clientes potenciales. Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por lo que se compromete en pagar puntualmente el pago de sus cuotas. Con los 2,000 soles que solicita, contratar\u00e1 peones para que le ayuden en la limpieza de su parcela sacando la maleza que crece. \n","en":"Indelecio is 59, and is married to Zenayda who is 50.  They have 6 children, and live together in their own house, located in the district of Pichari. He barely finished primary school, but this didn't prevent him from continuing to dream, as he wanted to have his own farm. \r\n\r\nThanks to his perseverance and effort, he managed to set himself up in agriculture. He uses natural organic methods without the use of chemicals. Since then he has practiced farming techniques that don't damage the environment. He's passing his knowledge on to his children so that they follow his example and at the same time he is teaching them to preserve the environment. \r\n\r\nHis products are well-known in the community for their quality. That's why the big wholesalers come to his land to buy his production at a competitive price; so he makes good profits. Usually his wife works with him, but sometimes his sons help.  During the harvest season he needs workers to assist with this. In the future, he wishes to add to his farm, as he needs to win more customers.  \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP, so he is committed to making his instalment payments on time.  With the 2,000 soles that he is applying for, he will hire workers to help him clear his land by removing weeds.

The store is open Monday to Sunday from early morning until dusk.\r\n\r\nThe financing Francisca is requesting is needed for investing in her business with the purchase of basic foods, such as soft drinks, candy, churros, and cookies, among others.  With this loan she expects to be able to earn more income to keep her business running and to support herself.  Her biggest challenge is to differentiate her shop from the others in the community, because there are many.\r\n\r\nFrancisca's dream is to own a mini-market and thereby improve her living conditions. This is her fifth loan cycle with Kiva partner FAMA.  She has paid previous loans on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":859926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase grocery staples.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Manto, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-31T21:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca Evelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.35},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8000.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784953,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

They have 3 children and live in their own house, located in the district of Pichari. Maribel is an extremely hardworking woman who wants to excel, along with the rest of her family. From the very beginning, even when she was young, she maD. her living working in the fields because her parents were farmers. As the years went by, she did not complete her schooling due to a lack of funds and she decided to work as a domestic employee. While working as a domestic employee, she met her beloved husband and they started a family.\r\n\r\nThey decided to use the little money that they had to build a home so that they could live peacefully along with their three beloved children, who are both a great satisfaction and a great responsibility. Since that time, Maribel had in mind that working as a domestic employee did not enable her to cover her family\u2019s expenses, not even with the small income her husband had from farming.

The women normally divide their time between doing household chores and working on their allotments. However, at present, the only available money-making activity is sheep fattening. The women therefore find themselves extremely busy taking care of their family's needs, as well as their own.\nThe group's leader (on the right of the picture, in red) is the mother of 8 children, 5 of whom go to primary school.

Robert's resolve and prolificacy has been part and parcel of his success the last four years as he plys his charcoal sales trade in Kampala.\r\n\r\nThe affable father of three is also a teacher by profession.\r\n\r\nLike many of his contemporaries, his involvement in an auxiliary business is, by and large, brought to pass by the low remuneration which teachers in Uganda have to contend with.

Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.5,"image":{"id":860343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buys a young milk giving cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Bhakapati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-08-31T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-23T08:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2592.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265734,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2592.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691543,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2592.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647908,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T09:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2592.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865040,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2592.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275025,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2592.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416491,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-01T01:38:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":331779,"name":"Neetu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neetu is 29 years-old .

This went very well, but she had to give it up, because of the negative effect this work had on her health.  This was how she started her business of making hammocks; a trade that she already knew. Gradually she started selling them. At the same time she began selling materials and supplies, so that the artisans of her town could get what they needed for their production at her store.\r\n\r\nCleotilde has been associated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 3 years, and has received 6 loans from the organization. With these, she has managed to increase her working capital, and to buy a display case, an electronic scale, and an electric thread winder. Her income has allowed her to improve her housing conditions. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to continue expanding her business, adding more machines to do better finishing work on the bags she makes. She also wants to offer a university education to her youngest son, for whom she is responsible.  Her greatest challenge is meeting customer demand, since even though her  working capital increases daily, it is becoming insufficient. \r\n\r\nThis is why she is coming to her Credikiva for her seventh loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Marion Santo Domingo. She will use the loan to buy materials to fill orders for bags, knapsacks and hammocks in a timely way.  \r\n\r\nHer experience in this business is her greatest strength; this and her good management of her obligations, as well as her long association with the Fundaci\u00f3n, are the reasons for her success, and what has enabled her to increase her income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":398.74,"image":{"id":859748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"\r\nTo buy materials to fill orders for bags, knapsacks and hammocks in a timely way.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-05T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cleotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":111316},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":113635},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":116002},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":118419},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":120886},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":123405},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125976},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":128600},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":131279},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":134014},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":136806},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":139662}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.74},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.08,"local_amount":111316,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":113037.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803789,"comment":null},{"amount":64.39,"local_amount":113635,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":115392.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614870,"comment":null},{"amount":65.74,"local_amount":116002,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":117796.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568822,"comment":null},{"amount":67.1,"local_amount":118419,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":120250.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780145,"comment":null},{"amount":68.5,"local_amount":120886,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":122755.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188537,"comment":null},{"amount":69.93,"local_amount":123405,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":125313.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324755,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-06T16:13:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":331792,"name":"Marisol","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Marisol , es habitante del municipio de Ticuantepe , junto a su esposo e hijas , \u00e9l le apoya con los gastos del hogar ya que labora en una empresa privada , los planes hacia un futuro es mejorar las condiciones de vida y apoyar siempre en sus estudios a sus peque\u00f1as para que logren   realizar una carrera profesional , do\u00f1a Marisol tiene serios problemas con el techo del hogar ya que en tiempos de lluvia la casa que llena de agua ocasionando inundaci\u00f3n , lo cual solicita que se le apoyo debido a que su salario no le ajusta para comprar de una sola vez todos los materiales que necesita para la inversi\u00f3n del techo .

She started her business by selling various types of merchandise such as clothes, shoes, and cosmetics.  As her income gradually increased, she began renting out washing machines.  This venture was started because she needed to contribute to the household expenses.  Now that her business is successful, it has become her project for life.  Most of her sales are made on credit, so her rate of billing collections is high.  Her greatest challenge is getting her customers to respond in a timely manner because she needs to collect the money in order to recoup her investment.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer reason for applying for a Kiva loan is so that she can finance her bills, increase her customer base, and pump new life into her business.

This is her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use the money to buy one washing machine and a variety of merchandise in time to sell during the month of love and friendship (the Colombian equivalent of Valentine\u2019s Day).  This period is when she traditionally sees a large spike in her sales and Nelcy does not plan to forego this opportunity.  Going forward she plans to grow by adding other businesses, such as telecommunications or an Internet caf\u00e9, so that she can create new sources of work to increase her income and provide for the greater well-being of her household.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":279.27,"image":{"id":859770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"to acquire an additional washing machine for rental and to buy merchandise to sell.

married and has three adult children. He was born in Kamenka. For a while he used to work in the North, from where he returned 14 years ago. Now Victor raises farm animals and sells meat and also grows vegetables. This is the most profitable business in Kamenka. Victor especially likes taking care of the animals, and his wife actively helps him working in the green houses where they grow tomatoes. Victor has been working as a farmer in 11 years. He has a large farm, with two ha [about 5 acres] of land.\r\n\r\nVictor needs a loan of 10,000 UAH in order to buy compound animal feed and raise pigs before the onset of winter. He is hoping to fatten a herd of pigs and sell them   three months later. Victor is a hard-working farmer. He likes his work, and the desire to develop his business motivates him to keep going and invest even more effort and resources in his farm. This year Victor is expanding  by building an additional farrowing pen for 50 piglets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: the loan description is in

As a mother and female head of household, Gladis has worked hard so that her only daughter can get ahead.  She currently lives with her mother and her siblings.  Going forward, her goal is to have a retail shop where she can diversify her product offerings even more so that she can meet the demands of the local residents.  Her greatest challenge is having sufficient capital to respond to her customers in a timely manner because they are placing larger and more frequent orders.

When she started her business, her sales were very low but she gradually acquired a niche market that has the capacity to buy all types of clothing that are of good quality and worth their value.  For this reason, her operating capital is insufficient for responding to her growing customer base.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  \r\n<p>\r\nLigia will use the money to buy women\u2019s dresses so that she can take advantage of the time of year when she sees a spike in sales, such as the Day of Love and Friendship (the Colombian version of Valentine\u2019s Day), which results in two months worth of orders.  With this loan, Ligia will be able to respond promptly to her customers and preserve the good reputation that she enjoys for being a businesswoman who fulfills her orders quickly.  Her goal for the future is to open a clothing shop so that she can be better positioned and be reached by customers and vendors.  Meanwhile she manages a profit margin of no less than 35%, from which she plans her growth and the development of her business with her husband.     \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":360,"image":{"id":859885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase women's dresses.

Su negocio es atendido por \u00e9l y un mec\u00e1nico, que adem\u00e1s presta el servicio de mantenimiento de motocicletas. Los principales productos que vende son guayas, empaquetadura, valineras, buj\u00edas, bandas para frenos, etc,. El taller de repuestos de motos es  reconocido por su atenci\u00f3n personalizada y por eso cuenta con una acreditada clientela, que diariamente crece y aumenta sus exigencias en cuanto a inversi\u00f3n se refiere; en la actualidad cuenta con un volumen de ventas, pues se ajusta a las necesidades de su clientes, en cuanto a precios, repuestos y servicios requeridos; as\u00ed mismo goza de una liquidez que potencializa inyecciones de capital de trabajo, para impactar su crecimiento. Abel a sus clientes otorga cr\u00e9ditos y tambi\u00e9n vende de contado, sus cuentas por cobrar rotan r\u00e1pidamente, lo mismo que sus inventarios en los que presenta un buen manejo, lo mismo que su indicador de rentabilidad presenta un buen \u00edndice.

He started the business seven years ago, but for two years he has been located in the Arboleda neighborhood in the town of Soledad in the department of Atl\u00e1ntico.  He and a mechanic attend to the business, which also provides motorcycle maintenance service.  The main products he sells are cables, gaskets, bearings, spark plugs, brake bands, etc.\r\n\r\nThe motorcycle parts shop is recognized for its personalized attention and, because of this, it has a reputable clientele that grows daily and increases its demands with regard to investment.  At present, Abel has high sales because he adapts to the needs of his customers regarding price and required parts and services.  Also, he enjoys a liquidity that promotes investments of working capital to impact his growth.  Abel grants credit to his customers and also sells in cash.  His accounts receivable turn over quickly, as does his inventory (which he manages well), and his profitability index is good.  \r\n\r\nThe level of competition in his market is very high, and this is precisely his big challenge.  There are several shops in the area and so Abel has to have a good stock of merchandise to respond to his customers opportunely.  This is precisely his big challenge, because his working capital is insufficient with regard to the demands of the market.  Because of this he needs a Kiva loan, his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy motorcycle parts to achieve his goal of stocking his store.\r\n\r\nAbel's dream for the future is to have his own place.  In the meantime, he takes great pains working to be able to achieve this, and he manages a profit margin of no less than 14%, from which he is planning his

She\u2019s been making children\u2019s outfits and multiple-use garments for the last 10 years with fabric and thread on two simple machines and with hand tools.  She learned the art of sewing on her own but managed to perfect it through courses that allowed her to set up her own business, work that her children who are upstanding, working people, feel very proud of her for.  Blanca also carries out another activity which is the sale of fast food, a business that operates in the morning and that only takes up two hours a day.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in their own house located in the district of Pichari. Romalda knows how difficult it is for a family with few resources to start a business that had never been established and without have any idea how to make it a reality. In the beginning the only thing that she had done was to find out the steps to follow to start a business, that of installing an agricultural greenhouse. When she began to remove the soil and prepare the seeds for planting, she did it with care and dedication. Since working hard for almost a year in that business, she found something she was passionate about, which is growing cacao, coffee, and citrus plants including grafted plants. Over the years she's made good profits so she doesn't regret having ventured into this business since it brings good profits, and she feels a yearning to continue working for the good of her family. In the near future, she plans to purchase land to build her own house which she very much longs for. This is her second loan with MFP, so she commits herself a second time to paying off the terms of the loan on time. She is the secretary of the communal bank, and so everyone is happy.With the 1,000 nuevos soles she will further invest in the cacoa plants. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":861136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to invest further in cacao plants.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When Fatima gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will buy the needed amount of beads and make extra quantities of embroidery to sell. This will increase the family income, which helps them to live in better life conditions. Fatima is photographed in FATEN's branch.
