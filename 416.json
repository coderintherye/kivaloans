She is the mother of two children who are 3 and 1 \u00bd years old.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan from Kiva to diversify her business with food products such as cassava flour or palm nut oil, but also to improve the quality of the products she currently offers her customers. She hopes this will enable her to increase her revenue-generating ability, and also accumulate enough capital to become a wholesaler in the future.\r\n\r\nShe will continue to request loans from Turame because their loan conditions are more flexible than those of other financial institutions.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the \u201cShishikara\u201d communal loan group.\r\n<br

This does not seem to cause him any difficulties and it is thanks to this job that he is able to provide for the costs of his home. In the future, he would like to continue improving his business and sales, since he hopes to become a successful businessman. At present, he is building his own home, in which he hopes one day to establish his business. This is the second loan he has requested from MFP. He has always been responsible in making his payments on time. Isidro is planning to invest the money he has requested in purchasing a large amount of beauty products wholesale.

He operates a business selling cold, purified water that he processes himself.  He also has a second business renting washing machines.  Leonardo wants to buy a trailer for his motorcycle so that he can more easily carry tanks of water and he needs to buy more tanks so that he can expand his water business.  That\u00b4s why he\u00b4s applying for a COP$1,000,000 loan.\r\nLeonardo is a bookkeeper and he worked for the state in Malambo for 6 years before he was laid off 2 years ago.  He used his severance pay to start a business selling cold meats.  He then hit on the idea of renting washing machines, a business for which he bought two machines.  A year ago, the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo matched him with a microbusiness selling purified water.  He started working for the business as a salesman.  When he saw the potential for the business, he applied to the Fundacion for a loan so that he could start his own business.  He bought a water purifier with three filters and 1 storage tank and the business now generates more than his other.  The problem is that he can\u00b4t easily carry the water so he has asked his sister to help him by riding along in a sidecar for deliveries.  Leonardo says that his life has changed since he received his first Fundacion loan because it\u00b4s allowed him to set up his own business and increased his income.  Losing his job was a challenge, but it has allowed him to develop his potential as an entrepreneur.  Since he doesn\u00b4t have a house of his own, he operates the business at his mother\u00b4s house.  Leonardo is very happy with the business because he can sell safe water to the people of Malambo where the feeling is that the water is not safe.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere

She gets up very early in the morning every day to prepare traditional dishes from the area like: empanadas (turnovers), milanesas (breaded meat), eggs and chipas (corn and cheese bread).  Her meals are prepared very hygienically with new and fresh ingredients so customers come by frequently to enjoy Aurelia\u2019s dishes.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for funding to buy the ingredients that she normally uses to prepare her meals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

His inventories include perfume, clothing, and watches. He has always liked sales and wants to earn extra income. For three years, Ramon has been selling these brand-name items to family, friends, and his growing clientele. He buys his inventory in bulk so that he can resell them at discounted prices. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ramon will be able to buy more inventories. He will be able to reach out to more customers and further expand his business. He supports himself, his wife, and their two children.\r\n\r\nRamon has had two previous loans from ACCION USA, which helped him get his business started. With his third loan, he plans to add to his inventory and increase sales. In the future, he hopes to open a storefront and maintain a stable business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":556047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He lives in his own home with his wife Elsa, 22, and their 3 beloved children, to whom they wish to provide a better future.  The fields that he cultivates have been, in the life of Aldo, an activity that has been necessary for survival; from the time that he was very small his parents always taught him that by working in the fields he would never lack for anything.  For this reason, he decided to continue in his family's line of work, and now he has his own cultivations where he plants bananas and coffee.  What he likes most about his work is to plant, because he knows that the economic tranquility of his family depends on this activity.  He has been doing this work for 8 years, and what he considers most difficult is to care for his crops when there are abrupt changes in the weather.  Over time he hopes to continue working hard and improving his crops.  This is his 6th loan with MFP, and he knows that this support will be very beneficial to him in developing his business.  In his communal bank, he is a very responsible member, which is the reason that he is well respected.  With the 800 Peruvian soles that he requests, he will buy more organic and chemical fertilizers for his crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":556244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer to care for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aldo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1843.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588290,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-18T09:21:19Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208587,"name":"Hector Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or H\u00e9ctor Antonio tiene un negocio de soldadura de manera  ambulante en pues el servicio que ofrece es de muy buena calidad.

T., a 23-year-old pepper producer and mother of three, lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. Mar\u00eda is a dedicated mother and producer. She plans to focus her efforts on the planting and harvest of Tabasco peppers. Mar\u00eda works in cooperation with her family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. Mar\u00eda\u00b4s husband works at a local orange-producing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement the family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and to buy food. The rural zone where Mar\u00eda and her family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water. The family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Mar\u00eda is working hard towards the sustenance of her family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from her land and labor.\r\n \r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Mar\u00eda and her family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of tabasco peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All laborial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Mar\u00eda with the help of her family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Mar\u00eda will need roughly one year before her peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest.\r\n \r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and caring for younger siblings. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting, working the land as needed. \r\n\r\nThe main factor that has stood in the way of increasing her production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Mar\u00eda, her family and community.

They own a small house of two rooms and have been living in it for the past ten years. She is involved in the boutique business, selling embroidered and stitched dresses. Her variety of clothes attracts customers to her boutique. She has been doing this work for over six years. Her client base is purely women. She prepares women's wear such as embroidered shalwar kamiz and stitched kurtas. These two garments are famous in Pakistan because women love to wear these dresses, not just for special occasions but also as everyday wear.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe sells her goods within her neighborhood and also to the clothing shops, delivering the finished products to the designated places.

She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenges she has are the high prices of raw materials and the fact that there are very many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers, hence customers are spoiled for choice.

A. is from the village of Poblacion, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 60 years old, married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Eustaquia owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling delicacies like fried peanuts, fried bananas and candies in the local community. Eustaquia has been in business for more than 25 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Eustaquia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eustaquia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Eustaquia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Eustaquia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

W. provides computer services. He also buys old computers, which he repairs and sells to the local people. He has been in this kind of business for the last four years and he says that the business is profitable and the only major challenge is that there are so many people doing the same kind of business as his. So customers are spoiled by the choice. He is using his loan of Kes 50,000 to purchase old computers, repair them and sell to the local people.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her business.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for an 11,000 Philippine peso loan. This amount will be used to buy more quantities of groceries, beverages and other items for the opening of her new variety store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow and that she will be able to buy her own house and lot. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance in regards to her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her business.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan.

This school was established in 1960 to improve on the standard of education for the children of Lunsar and its surrounding village. This school is staffed by nine dedicated teachers and has 324 pupils. Out of the nine staff, four have applied for a loan of 3,900,000 leones from SMT\/Kiva lenders for the first time. \r\n\r\nStaff from this institution, like many other schools\u2019 staff within SMT\u2019s operational area, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their salaries alone. With the help of a loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land or house-building materials; or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay their loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nAbu Bakarr, 46, is the headmaster at the school and leader of this group.

He is married with 5 children between the ages of 3 and 10, all of whom are attending school.  He is a dairy farmer from Litein, in Rift Valley, Kenya. He has been farming for 4 years and has employed one person from the community. His products are milk, which he sells to the tea estate, and tea, which he sells to the Kenya Tea Development Authority. Before venturing into farming Richard was operating a hotel business.  His biggest challenges in farming are lack of animal feed, the high cost of artificial insemination services, which are not readily available, and a lack of knowledge about dairy farming.\r\n\r\nRichard has requested this loan of KES 45,000 from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

Zaffarjon is a very courageous man who can manage tough jobs like raising cattle and agriculture. He is the father of three children, and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, Zaffarjon has been able to get ahead in his business by purchasing cattle which he breeds on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It is for this reason that Zaffarjon has come to IMON International for a loan to purchase more animals for breeding.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history.  It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And thus she decided to switch to selling \u201cpagnes\u201d [traditional colorful fabric for wrap clothing] and shoes. She has learned the trade from a friend of hers. Now, with four years of experience, she knows her business well. After four solidarity [group] loans, all repaid without any issues, she is now on her first individual loan. In order to upgrade her business, she decided to collaborate with Soro Yriwaso in order to purchase sets of \u201cpagnes\u201d and packs of shoes. She stocks up in Bougoni and in Bamako (the capital of Mali). She sells her wares at the local market to customers living in the area, mostly women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to achieve a monthly income of 35,000 West African francs, which will allow her to upgrade her business and to pay off the interest on her loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":556606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing \"pagnes\" fabric and shoes [for resale]","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chatta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699758,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913666,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180797,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476766,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613480,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751906,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606156,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917787,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360734,"comment":null},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226105,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-02T02:36:43Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208750,"name":"Codou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Codou D. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 53 ans et s'active depuis plus de 10 ans dans la vente de bissap (oseille.

is a devoted mother who struggles day after day to provide the best for her family. Five years ago she got the idea to start raising cattle in order to contribute to the family finances. She took advantage of the space she had available on her family\u2019s land to start this business, which she runs together with her husband. Slowly her number of cows has increased, and her clients have started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps, and for this reason she is requesting a loan. Gulnora invites you to be an important part of the growth of her business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history.  It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

I. is 24 years old. She is single and has one child, aged three years old, whom she hopes to provide with a quality education. Her business is located at a busy market area in Kakamega. She sells second-hand clothes to the local people. She says that this business is profitable, and the only major challenge she has is that her debtors fail to keep the promise to pay their debts as per their agreements, therefore bringing down her sales.

The major challenge he has is high prices for the items he sells, making them unaffordable to some local people. However, he works very hard to keep his business going well.

It usually begins with table-top selling and then grows to become a kiosk and eventually becomes a supermarket. Isheitu is one of such entrepreneurs; she has been trading in groceries like biscuits, bottled water, candies, canned foods, rice, cooking oil, toiletries, etc. for the past 6 years. She is hoping that, one day, she will be able to rent a bigger shop to expand her business. \r\n\r\nIsheitu is excited to be taking the loan which she plans to invest in purchasing groceries in bulk to serve her customers.

If she gets this loan, Sarah will purchase additional goods, mainly foodstuffs like rice, sugar, etc. With these additional goods, Sarah will hopefully earn more profit which will allow her to keep reinvesting for better financial stability."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":556649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a variety of goods, mainly foodstuffs, to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"RUHENGELI","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-06-19T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152782075,"comment":null},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":107034.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037341,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172309048,"comment":null},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":127421.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616653,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622852,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760676,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497608,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-19T16:32:11Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208784,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"40-year-old A.

Barring the achievements he has registered, he is still behind schedule in many of his other set objectives. It\u2019s for this reason that he wants this loan.

She lived with her late husband in a large household in the North Pelengana quarter of S\u00e9gou (the fourth largest administrative region in the Republic of Mali). She did not attend school, and so began working with her mother at an early age, selling condiments. After many years learning the trade alongside her mother, she began selling cereals eleven years ago and has established a good reputation for herself. She sells her goods at the chateau market, alongside other condiment stalls. Her booming sales are thanks to the quality of her goods which are held in high regard.  In order to generate higher profits, she has approached Soro Yiriwaso. She has been a customer of theirs for 54 months, and has received 3 community and 3 individual loans, all of which have been successfully repaid. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth individual loan, and she aims to use it to buy a ton of rice. She sources her goods from suppliers at Niono and S\u00e9ribala. Madame Catherine Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 takes cash and credit sales from a customer base made up of men and women.

She lives with her husband in a large traditional family in the first district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nHaving abandoned school in the 9th primary grade (Malian education system) to get married, she started business beside her mother who sold Moroccan living rooms. After spending several years in apprenticeship at her side, she ran several income-generating businesses such as the sale of fruit juices. She wound up taking up the trade of carpets that she has been engaged in for 3 years and enjoys a large customer base. The strength of her sales is due to the quality of her products that are often imported but also to her affordable prices.\r\nWith the objective of increasing the size of her business to make more profits, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. This is her first individual loan that she intends to use to purchase 8 carpets. She gets her supplies in Tombouctou. Mrs. Nana M\u2019barka H. sells cash and on credit to a customer base of women and men.\r\nWith this loan, she plans to make a monthly profit of 60,000 CFA francs. This profit will enable her to take part in the funding of social events (christenings, weddings etc.\u2026) and support herself. Her ambition is to promote her business and go forward.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Marie-Elodie Bazy, Kiva

Baja\" (\"the Sunflowers of Rumichaca D. Baja\") group. Urubamba is an hour and 10 minutes form the city of Cusco, but the members meet in the community of Rumichaca, which is 10 minutes from the city of Urubamba. The city of Urubamba is known for being part of the Sacred Valley of the Incas, and is on the way to the Incan citadels of Ollantaytambo and Machupichu (the eighth wonder of the world). The main economic activities of the villagers of Rumichaca incluD. crafts, livestock and tourism. The \"Rumichaca Baja\" community bank is composed of 20 hard-working and enterprising women. The majority of the members decided to open their own businesses such as: food sales; raising small animals; jora [a corn variety] and chicha [maize liquor] sales; vegetable sales; bean sales; corn sales; and grocery sales.\r\nIn the meeting, we picked a member at random, and it was Miss Vistacion who answered us very kindly. She is 42, married, and a native of Urubamba. She has six children (Rosemary, 22; Carla, 20; Cynthia, 15; Maria, 9; Gisela, 6; and Fabricio, 3). She raises small animals such as pigs, guinea pigs and chicken, and she is also engaged in livestock and agriculture. Visitacion sells her agricultural products in the Urubamba market on Wednesdays. Her complementary economic activity is selling maize liquor on Mondays and Thursdays. She has belonged to the community bank for 10 years and it has gone very well for her. She needs this loan for her agriculture and livestock. Part is for purchasing fertilizer and seeds, and the other part is for food for her animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva

She buys it wholesale to later sell it individually in the area where she lives.To date, she wakes up at four in the morning to get enough bread to resell. This job is profitable since there are no other bakeries nearby and many customers are not able to go very far to buy this product. She feels happy and relieved for having her job because it keeps her busy and she can offer her family a good quality of life.

She enjoys her business and wants to continue it because of the earnings and the benefits.  Our member began with $50 in capital.  Her method of selling her products is by traveling throughout the city and offering them to her friends but allowing them to pay in 2 payments.

However, the jewelry sells more and better, above all the Brazilian brand, Gale.

This group has been meeting in the beautiful, Manab\u00ed capital for several years.  Its members are honorable women in a proud and hard-working city.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Luciana is in a relationship and has 2 children.  She works 8 hours a day in a child development center.  She is also a Yanbal products consultant.  Her customers buy from a catalog.  Once she has an order she places is all at one time on credit.  At night she studies early childhood education at the university in Portoviejo.  She is in her fifth semester. Her mother-in-law is a big help as she cares for her children when she has to work.  A major advantage for our member is that the majority of her customers are her co-workers and fellow students.  This way she does not have to sell door to door.   \r\n\r\nWith this new loan Se\u00f1ora Luciana will be able to buy beauty products like cosmetics, imitation jewelry and colognes for men, as this is what she sells the most of. One of her dreams is to retire from this line of work and to venture into another business, namely selling bed sheets.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva

responsable member of the \u201cCorazones Felices\u201d (Happy Hearts) communal bank, located in the city of Portiviejo, in the Andr\u00e9s de Vera parish.  She has been married for nine years and has a seven year old son.  She sells grilled chicken on the weekends, when she sets up on a street near her home from 2:00pm to 7:00pm.\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Martha to invest in chicken and other supplies for her business.  She normally stocks up once a week.  She is able to sell everything that she prepares because the people in her sector have a great affinity for sports.  She normally sells approximately 200 chicken wings.  This business is of great economic help to her family, especially since her husband only gets periodic jobs as a driver.\r\n\r\nMartha is very happy with the previous loans she has gotten through the foundation.

She has been working in agriculture since childhood and with her husband she grows cereals and grains such as wheat, barley, corn, beans, quinoa and peas. These are the most profitable products to sell. During the harvest season, she sells them wholesale to market traders and tries to sell them directly with no intermediaries, depending on the occasion and the market price. For this reason, she takes great care of her plantations in order to prevent pest attacks.

T. B. is a 52-year-old pepper farmer and father of six who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in northern Costa Rica. The rural zone where Jos\u00e9 and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Jos\u00e9 is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is a dedicated farmer and father. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of tabasco and cayenne peppers. He works in cooperation with his wife to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his agricultural activity, Jos\u00e9 works at a local orange-processing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement his family\u2019s income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and food.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Jos\u00e9 and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of tabasco and cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Jos\u00e9 with the help of his family members. Jos\u00e9 will need roughly one year before his peppers reach maturity and are ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the mornings, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and sending the children to school. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvesting, planting, and working the land as needed. Jos\u00e9 spends some days working as a laborer in the nearby orange-processing factory but this work is sporadic.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 says the main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions.

He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who range in age from 17 to  28 years old. \r\n\r\nTeresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.

Her previous loan of PHP 28,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy ingredients and fertilizer so that she can continue to save to expand her land holdings and buy more livestock in the future.\r\n\r\nTeresita M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

C. is a married woman who lives in Prk. 2, Tuyom, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buying and selling rice and a general store business. Her husband, Dionesio D. C., who is 58 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have 10 children who are 4 months to 26 years old. \r\n\r\nCharily joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Charily has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP - improving the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP which she intends to use as additional working capital and to buy fertilizer so that she can continue to save up for the future and purchase additional agricultural land. \r\n\r\nCharily D. C. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and

R.  is a 33-year old married woman who lives in Magallon Cadre, Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: buying and selling of scrap and raising pigs.\r\n\r\nMaritess husband, Randy, is a baker and they have 4 children who are between 3 and 12 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nMaritess  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999  in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in 2 businesses, buying and selling scrap and raising pigs. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php4,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMaritess  is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php16,000 was used to fund operations of her scrap business, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 12th loan, the amount of Php19,000, which she intends to use as an additional working capital. Maritess  is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":549656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional

A. is a 49-year-old married woman who lives in Prk 3, Brgy Cambarus, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by engaging in a general store business.\r\n\r\nCecilia\u2019s 56-year-old husband, Mamerto, is a farmer. They have seven children who are between 7 and 24 years old. Five of their children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. The others work to help the family.\r\n\r\nCecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income through the general store business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nCecilia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 was used to fund operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 10th cycle loan, the amount of PHP 13,000, which she intends to use on her general store. Cecilia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":549950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
