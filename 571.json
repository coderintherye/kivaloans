He wants to grow his business and promises to repay the current loan without any violations and thanks all lenders for their support.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She decided on her own initiative to start a business so she could increase the household income, buying merchandise such as women's clothing, and selling it to a small number of customers.  Her dream to strengthen her business led her to persist and work constantly to expand it.  In this way she started to attract new customers and now, not only does she sell clothing, but she also sell shoes, and she sells in large quantities, satisfying the demand of all of her good and profitable customers.  Her goal and great challenge is to have a busy point of sales where she could offer a large variety of products, so that she could respond to the needs of her customers in a timely manner.  Her greatest goal is to have her own home where she could also have space for her business.  While she works toward that dream, she manages accounts receivable that rotate every 15 days, and a profit margin no less than 40 percent.  She will continue to drive the performance of her business so that in the future she can accomplish her goals.  Now she has come to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan that she will use to purchase clothing, shoes, and cosmetics. With these products she can fill outstanding orders from her customers, which will ensure that her investment will be successful.\r\n\r\n

She is an accountant.  Teodolinda began this work when she was 23 years old. She studied public accounting on Saturdays, while on week days she worked at accounting. She paid her own university expenses without anyone's help. Since her father was a farmer and her mother a house wife, they couldn't pay for her professional studies. This has been her first business. She offers services to 5 clients and has from 7 to 10 years of working with each of them.

","en":"Claudia P. lives with her husband and her one year old son in the Nueva Esperanza neighborhood.  She started her hardware business in this community.   From her sales spot she sells bolts, brackets, replacement parts, paint, adhesives, and glue for PVC pipes.  She has been gradually adding different merchandise like plastic flip flops.\r\n\r\nThe business was born because the couple joined their sales experience.   They considered that the neighborhood community needed to make household repairs, and they had to move to the city of Barranquilla.  That is the reason that they located a place to sell retail hardware.\r\n\r\nThey established a small commercial location close to where they live.  That way Claudia did not have to neglect her household responsibilities.  Also, the customers saved on the transportation to buy small items.\r\n\r\nClaudia and her husband have created many dreams with this business.  One of those is to diversify their sales locations specializing in many areas of the city of Barranquilla.  That will strengthen their income in the future in order to build a better future for their son.  She dreams of him being successful and very professional in what he undertakes.\r\n\r\nThis is her first Kiva loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will buy merchandise that has a high turnover in her business.  She will buy things like adhesives, plastic belts, pipes, wiring, soft wire, screws, and a large volume of nuts.  This investment will be successful because theirs is the only hardware business.  Many times they have to stop selling because their merchandise turns over very quickly.  Her biggest challenge is the size of her place.  It is very small, and she cannot increase her inventory as she would like to.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":448.16,"image":{"id":740997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy high turnover merchandise like adhesives, plastic belts, pipes, wiring, soft wire, screws, and a large volume of nuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-03-28T21:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":72993},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76308},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77771},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79262},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80781},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82329},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83907},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85515},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":87154},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90527},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94628}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.77},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.15,"local_amount":72993,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":75109.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230526,"comment":null},{"amount":41.97,"local_amount":76308,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":78520.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509376,"comment":null},{"amount":42.77,"local_amount":77771,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":80025.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673597,"comment":null},{"amount":43.59,"local_amount":79262,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":81560.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320156,"comment":null},{"amount":44.43,"local_amount":80781,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":83123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803291,"comment":null},{"amount":45.28,"local_amount":82329,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":84716.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614375,"comment":null},{"amount":46.15,"local_amount":83907,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-25T08:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":86339.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568343,"comment":null},{"amount":47.04,"local_amount":85515,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87994.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779687,"comment":null},{"amount":47.93,"local_amount":87154,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":89681.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188106,"comment":null},{"amount":48.85,"local_amount":88825,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91400.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324343,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-28T23:21:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":286179,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth A.

He is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for a loan to buy fruit and vegetables like, bananas, avocadoes, carrots, etc.  He has had a stand in Mexico City\u2019s La Merced Market for 8 years and comments that his experience goes back 17 years because he started working in his parents\u2019 stand when he was 8 years old.  He comments that he did not stay in school because he was helping them.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Juan has lived for the last 8 years in a common law relationship with Crisanta who helps her husband with the stand they have in the market in Mexico City. They have two children: Jacqueline, 5 and Emmanuel, 2.\r\n\r\nHe is a very hard working person who rises daily at 3am to stock up at Mexico City\u2019s wholesale foodstuffs market.  Juan comments that right now one of his challenges is to finish his house that he\u2019s building for his family.   He\u2019s been investing his savings into it bit by bit and, thanks to the loans, he has been able to stock his fruit and vegetable stand very well which produces more profits.  This way he will be able to finish his house for his little children.\r\n\r\nHe comments that his life plans and goals are to finish the house, which he hopes to do soon, and to continue investing in the business to be able to rent a locale to sell his fruit and vegetables.  Juan says that he will use the profits he makes from the fruit and vegetable sales to buy iron rods, cement, sand and other building materials to finish his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":736617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fruit and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-28T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":627.39},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":682.54},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":697.26},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":712.31},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":727.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":743.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":759.41},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":775.8},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":792.54},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":809.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":827.11},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":844.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.03},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.77},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.04},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.01},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.03,"local_amount":627.39,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":647.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292512,"comment":null},{"amount":118.81,"local_amount":1379.51,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1422.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160773,"comment":null},{"amount":188.01,"local_amount":2183.1,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2251.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233647,"comment":null},{"amount":132.2,"local_amount":1534.94,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512466,"comment":null},{"amount":137.97,"local_amount":1601.94,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1652.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223120,"comment":null},{"amount":143.98,"local_amount":1673.12,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1725.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-29T23:29:27Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":286198,"name":"Anastacio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Anastasio tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad que es due\u00f1o de una tienda de abarrotes. \u00c9l quiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos para su tienda como az\u00facar, frijoles, huevos, aceite, refrescos, jab\u00f3n, alimentos enlatados, cloro, velas, y mucho m\u00e1s.

He says that it was very hard work, which is why he had to return to his town where he began investing in the business of buying, raising and selling sheep, horses and cows and thus be more aware of his family.  He started this business ten years ago and he sells his animals at the market in Zitacuaro and sometimes in his own town.\r\n<p>\r\nAlejo requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to invest in sheep to raise and then sell.

She is originally from Macho D. Agua located in the state of Michoacan.  Nazaria is 30 years old and states that she only completed 5th graD. in elementary and did not go on any further because her parents had minimal resources and could not buy her the books.\r\nShe is known as \"Naza\" by her friends and neighbors and dedicates herself to raising and selling sheep.  She is a very hard working person and takes her sheep to graze at a very early hour to a plot where she and her husband plant grass for their animals to eat. She states that with the loan she will purchase more sheep, feed, vaccinations, parasite medication, and vitamins so that the sheep grow quickly for her to sell at a good price.  She has been doing this for 2 years and started in this type of business because she says it is profitable and they are easy to raise and you don't have to invest too much into this type of animal.  She sells her sheep locally and sometimes takes them to auction in Zitacuaro.  Nazaria's goal is to build them a shed so they won't be cold and so they won't get sick.  She is married to Genaro who is 38 years old and is a day laborer.  They have four children who are sponsored by Vision Mundial (World Vision).  She states, \" Thanks to World Vision my children have a better quality of life and also thanks to Fundacion Realidad ( Reality Foundation) because this way I have a source of employment to help out my husband with household expenses and with the kids.\"\r\nAugustina is part of the group, \" Los Espinales\" and originates from Macho D. Agua, Michoacan.  She is 38 years old and studied until 3rd graD. and did not continue her education because she helped her parents out by working and didn't have enough to cover her school expenses; also her dad would tell her, \" women were born to work around the house and take care of the kids, not be out in the streets so called \"working\", that is why they have their husbands to support them.\", and that is why he wouldn't let her continue studying.  Augustina is soliciting a loan from Fundacion Realidad ( Reality Foundation) to purchase more sheep and increase her livestock to facilitate their sale in bulk, she also adds that she will be purchasing feed and vitamins.  She has been at this business for 3 years and sells her sheep to a client in Zitacuaro who makes barbacoa ( mexican food ).  Augustina is married to Leonidas who is a day laborer and they have 5 children.  Her goal is to open a store selling groceries in order to have another source she can draw money from for her children's education.  \r\nThe other 5 members are: Maria Lucia D. Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda, Natalia D. C., Rosa Maria V. M., Juana H.

She said that they named the group this because this is the name of the road that goes by her house and ends in the archeological ruins of Zirahuato. Mrs. Hilda is 46 years old. She has studied in secondary school but she didn\u2019t finish her studies because the preparatory school is far from her house and she didn\u2019t have the money to pay for transportation. Mrs. Hilda is well known among her friends and neighbors. She sells clothes such as blouses, pants for children and men, bathing suits, etc. She has been doing this business for the past fifteen years. She sells her clothes in different places such as Zirahuato and Benito Juarez. She sells her clothes to friends and acquaintances that pay her in payments or by demand. She started this business as a way to help her husband with the family\u2019s expenses.  She buys the clothes at different outlets in Toluca City in the state of Mexico. One of the difficulties that she has is that her customers pay her in payments but they don\u2019t always pay their payments and she looses the money. Mrs Hilda is married to Mr. Benito who has a small farm where he grows avocados, peaches and also cultivates gladiola flowers. They have four children, all of which are married. Her goal is to open a clothing business in her home that can be open daily. \r\nMr. Gildardo is part of the group called \u201cCamino Real\u201d.  He is originally from Puntecillas, a place that is close to the archeological ruins of Zirahuato. He is 49 years old and has completed his studies up to the third year of secondary school. He didn\u2019t finish his studies because he had to help his parents as they had other children to support. Mr. Gil is known for his friendships. He is asking for this loan, from Fundacion Real, for the maintenance and repair of his taxi. He has been driving a taxi for fourteen years. He likes this job as he gets to know many people and places in the country. One of the difficulties that he has is that there is a lot of competition and sometimes he doesn\u2019t earn a lot. His wife helps with the household expenses. The other problem that he has had is that he had an accident and his taxi was damaged. He needs to have it repaired, as it is the way he earns a living. Mr. Gil is married to Maria Ortega who is a kindergarten teacher. They have four children, three of which are married. None of the children live with them. Their daughter, Yoselin, studies at the university in Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n. Mr. Gildardo\u2019s goal is to have a small farm where he can grow avocados so that he has another source of income. He wants his daughter to have a good career that can support her when she grows up. The other members of \u201cCamino Real\u201d are named Eloy and Mariela. They will invest their loan money in buying fruits and vegetables and buying groceries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":738594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes for women, men and children ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-29T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eloy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gildardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1582.69},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1672.32},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1708.4},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1745.26},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1821.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1860.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1900.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1941.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1983.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.74},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.86},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.06},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.31},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.52},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.09,"local_amount":1582.69,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292517,"comment":null},{"amount":286.42,"local_amount":3380.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3430.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160782,"comment":null},{"amount":453.23,"local_amount":5349.55,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5428.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233656,"comment":null},{"amount":318.68,"local_amount":3761.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3817.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512475,"comment":null},{"amount":332.58,"local_amount":3925.54,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3983.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223129,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-31T02:53:10Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":286225,"name":"Librada Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Librada is from the village of Dinas, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental.

He lives in his own house in the urban part of the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region. His community is small yet shows many signs of development.\r\n\r\nFor more than five years, Jorge has earned a living by providing passenger transportation services in a taxicab and a \"mototaxi\", a unit that consists of a motorcycle and an attached cabin for carrying people. Currently, he rents both of these vehicles. Jorge has requested a loan so that he can make urgent repairs to the air-conditioning and the muffler in his taxicab. With these repairs, he will be able to keep his vehicle in good condition so that he can provide excellent service to his customers and continue generating income. For this reason, Jorge has requested a loan of 2000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa. \r\n\r\nJorge\u2019s taxi service has been quite profitable and he plans in the near future to purchase his own taxicab, which will be the start of a small fleet of cabs he hopes to own and manage.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married and has two children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Needless to say, this kind of business undertaking comes with a lot of cutthroat competition, given the high alcohol consumption levels in most urban areas in Uganda, Jinja being one of them. \r\n\r\nAware of that fact, N. Hanifa, a happily married mother of five, has worked tirelessly to establish her own niche and to get into the good graces of not only new, but old and prospective patrons. Her Pub offers a wide variety of beverages. \r\n\r\nHanifa says she began this business with a paltry capital base in the amount of 20,000 UGX.

Minda, as she is called by friends, reached only high school and fervently wishes that her children will reach farther than she did. She is married to Ronald, a vendor. They have five children. Two are in high school, another two study in elementary, and the youngest is not yet of school age. They used to live in Pangasinan, but at present the whole family resides in Libertad, Pasay City.\n\nAside from the profits of their tricycle operations which go to their family's needs, Minda focuses on her food stall as another primary source of income. Everyday she prepares breakfast and snacks as part of the menu, serving the customers who are too busy to prepare their own meals or those who stay on the road too long and do not have enough time to go home to eat. Minda has her own space in the community's public market, and she has sold from there for thirteen years now. Ronald helps her with the daily tasks. Every month they are able to earn around $320.\n\nTo help her expand her food stall, Minda is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will use this money to purchase necessary ingredients for cooking, such as cooking oil, coconut, eggs and brown sugar, as well supplies such as spaghetti noodles and macaroni. Minda recognizes the big help the loan represents in her business, as it helps her augment her family's needs with increased profits.\n\nAccording to Minda herself, daily sales become low during the rainy season. Another challenge to her comes as the result of her child's early marriage. This child of hers was not prepared to establish a separate home, and still lives with them. Minda prays that her child and her son-in-law will find a decent job to support themselves. For her other children, she prays that they would fulfill her dream of seeing them graduate from college. Minda wants to see her business grow and have good sales daily. She also dreams of having her own commercial space. \n\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":741337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase

Rosalie was not able to finish her courses in college, but her involvement in CCT* enabled her to build her own small business. She is now married to a driver named Arnel, and together they have four dependents. One is in high school, two are in elementary, and one is not yet studying. Together they live in Libertad, Pasay City.\r\n\r\nRosalie buys and sells accessories for a living. She has a space in the commercial area of their community in Libertad. There she displays her personally chosen accessories, which she hopes are fashionable enough to catch the attention of potential buyers. Rosalie has been selling accessories for fifteen years now, and she does it without the help of an employee. Monthly she and her husband are able to earn about $295.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Rosalie is borrowing an amount of 21,000 PHP to be able to purchase stylish accessories for sale. She acknowledges that the loan will help her in revolving the finances of her business. With this loan, she is able to buy huge quantities of stock and meet her family's daily needs as well.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Rosalie faces is the number of customer debts. Also, sometimes the daily sales are low. Another challenge is that her eldest child is beginning to keep bad company in school. She thus prays that she would have the time to focus on the studies of her children and keep them from bad influences. It is her earnest desire to bring them closer to the Lord. She also would like to have her own commercial space.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":741344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

Although Analyn only has high school education, she is ever determined to succeed in life. She is married to William, a taxi driver, and they have a child who attends elementary school. They used to live in Naga City in the lower part of Luzon, but now they live in Caloocan City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nDirect selling is one source of income for Analyn. She distributes catalogs of famous beauty brands in her community, gets orders from friends and neighbors, buys these orders from the sales office, and delivers them to customers for a commission. However, her focus as of the moment is selling corn near their community in Kiko, Camarin. She has been selling corn for six years and is able to earn PHP 7,280 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her businesses, Analyn is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan. She will use this money to buy essential ingredients to sell corn, such as corn, sugar, and margarine. She also plans to expand her business by selling other nutritious food such as sweet potatoes, peanuts, Indian mangoes, and bananas. The loan will benefit her greatly as it serves as the finances to sustain such business ventures.\r\n\r\nVacations are difficult for Analyn's business, as they are to other micro-entrepreneurs' businesses, since there are fewer customers. Nevertheless, Analyn works hard to make sure she helps her family with its daily needs. She continually looks for innovations or expansion in her business, because the bottom line is that she wants to become successful.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":741349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to

Susan has high hopes that she will earn big and be able to start on her savings, with the help of CCT.\r\n\r\nRainy seasons are a challenge to Susan because they hamper her business productivity. However, since they cannot be avoided, Susan devises ways to make the rainy seasons work to her advantage.

she didn't finish her Hotel and Restaurant Management (HRM) course in college, Shirley B., 42, refuses to give up on her future. She works on her own micro-business to make sure that she'll be better off in the end. She is married to Salvador, a customer service representative, and they have two children who are both in college. The family resides in Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nShirley sells frozen food to members of her local community. This type of food has a good market since a lot of people look for cheaper alternatives to fresh meat and an easier fix for a meal. Shirley chooses good quality frozen food such as sweetened pork, ham, and sausages for her well-deserving customers. Shirley also has a mineral water station. She has juggled these two businesses for four years and earns a monthly net income of around PHP 6,900.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Shirley has applied for a loan of PHP 8,000. She will add this to her current capital in order to purchase more quantities of quality meat goods to sell to her regular customers. She will also purchase more cases of mineral water for refilling. Shirley believes this loan will help her greatly increase her profits.\r\n\r\nShirley has the same challenges as other micro-entrepreneurs, such as irresponsible non-paying customers and tough competition. However, being a community partner in one of the fellowships in CCT* enables her to find ways to solve and overcome these issues.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, Shirley faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

She is married to Angelito L., a bus driver, and is the mother of a young boy now at preparatory school. By the grace of God, Gemma has managed to support her child's schooling and she is now working hard to be able to send him all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Gemma, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nGemma maintains a direct sales business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands such as Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is paid for in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer, who has a one-month-to-pay credit. Since dealers\u2019 cost prices are lower than those in the catalog, they earn profit on the price difference. Gemma's regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 700 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Gemma is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.

The other four are at home. Their family resides in Carmona, Cavite.\r\n\r\nGirlie has a mineral water refilling business.  She also sells liquefied petroleum gas tanks and rice.  She also rents out four rooms for local transients and bed spacers.  In addition, Girlie manages her direct selling business of cosmetics, apparels, footwear and accessories. She has juggled these businesses for years now, and monthly she earns an estimated net income of around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her businesses, Girlie has applied for a loan worth Php14,000. She will add this to her current capital in order to be able to purchase more cases of mineral water, additional LPG tanks, and sacks of rice. Girlie believes this loan will help her greatly in increasing her profits.\r\n\r\nGirlie has the same challenges as the other micro entrepreneurs, such as irresponsible non-paying customers and tough competition. But being part of the fellowships in CCT* as a community partner enables her to find ways to solve and overcome these issues.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

She and her husband Cyniaque support their three children, all of whom have received their education.\r\n\r\nSince the age of 11, Kai has helped in a general store and she now runs a stall selling various household and personal goods. This loan will enable her to purchase bowls, shoes and tissues from Tokpa, Benin's largest market. Her aim in the long term is to increase her scope of products. Her strongest point as an entrepreneur is her ability to satisfy customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":741466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase plastic bowls, shoes, and tissues for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Calavi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-03-29T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anasthasie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"C\u00e9lestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9phine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":470000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":47000},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":47000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206089629,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211160481,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216443674,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221608045,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226977579,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232736958,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238541674,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244501328,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251061733,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":47000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":47772.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257111982,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-29T20:40:51Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:24:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":286412,"name":"Hiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hiba is a young woman from Hebron.

Her husband is a farmer. Minavarkhon lived with her family in the village of Karasuu (in the south of Kyrgyzstan). They worked in animal husbandry and agriculture, cultivating vegetables and cotton.  Unfortunately, the income produced by their small plot of land was very difficult to live on.  \r\n\r\nSince many of Minavarkhon\u2019s relatives moved to the Chuysky area (in the northern part of the country), in 2002 Minavarkhon\u2019s family also sold their house and cattle and moved to Petrovka village (in the Chuysky area) where they bought a house and a barn to keep cattle. Right after moving, Minavarkhon\u2019s family had problems.  They could not expand their farm or find a job, but in due course they rented one hectare of earth and grew tomatoes and peppers. After taking out her first loan for 20,000 som (KGS), Minavarkhon bought a cow and began to make a profit selling milk. Over time, the family\u2019s life has changed.  Her son Bahtiyar helps his parents in everything, and Minavarkhon is raising two grandsons and is very happy. Today, on Minavarkhon\u2019s farm, there is a milk cow, two calves being fattened, and also three hectares of rented land growing tomatoes, peppers, and watermelons which she sells in the local market.\r\n\r\nMinavarkhon is asking for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy a milk cow and a stockpile of feed.  In the future, she plans to expand the farm and dreams of buying a car.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband sells car spare parts at the market and he helps his wife in his free time.\r\n\r\nMostly, Dilorom buys a cow with a newborn calf. Then, once the cow stops giving out milk, she sells the cow and keeps the calf.  She sells milk to private entrepreneurs, who produce dairy products. Dilorom would like to get a loan of 7,900 Somoni to purchase young cattle. She is hoping to further develop her business with this additional assistance.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mombasa is the coastal region in Kenya known for tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nRaphael has been in this business for fifteen years now and has managed to give employment to two people. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is financial constraints. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 20,000 to buy more milk to grow his business and meet the demand of his customers. He hopes that in future, he will own his farm with cows from where he will be able to get milk. He also plans to buy a van for transporting milk. He describes himself as a very ambitious man."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":741596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy milk to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mombasa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-4.05 39.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":138,"posted_date":"2011-03-29T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raphael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206225460,"comment":null},{"amount":45.48,"local_amount":3638,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-25T08:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3829,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217713144,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221894009,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227253920,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881083,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T09:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239829898,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T09:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245059014,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250872950,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":1819,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1914.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257281482,"comment":null},{"amount":22.6,"local_amount":1810,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:59:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1905,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263422609,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-29T21:45:00Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:59:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":286470,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa is a 35 year old lady.

E. is 55, married, and has two daughters. She worked as a nurse for a long time but her wage was too low to cover the expenses of her children. For this reason, in 1990 she engaged in a business of breeding cattle. Starting with the initial capital of 5,000 KGS she managed to develop a farm with two milk cows and fifteen sheep. With the revenues from selling milk and meat products, she was able to pay for the education of her elder daughter who dreams to be a designer. \r\n\r\nAsyl has applied for a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase more cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married and a father of two children. He is engaged in the business of animal husbandry. He has been in this business for a year, and the money invested in his business was earned in the Russia Federation.\r\n\r\nAfter buying young cattle, he feeds them during two or three months and when they gain weight and become larger he sells them at a reasonable price. All of the money which he earns he provides for his family\u2019s needs. Alisher\u2019s purpose is to develop his farm and therefore he is seeking a loan of 1,500 Somoni to buy young cattle for his business.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in a cheerful neighborhood full of hard-working people called Carrizal.  Dionsio lives with his wife and has three children, two of whom still live with him.  He started his business 32 years ago because he couldn't find any job opportunities with a large company.  At first he sold toys at Christmas, then he sold clothes, and now he has chosen to sell only sports shoes and school shoes.\r\n\r\nThis is Dionisio's first Kiva loan, though he has obtained 12 loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo over a period of 15 years.  These loans have helped him to increase his working capital and profits, and take care of his family's welfare.

Thirteen years later, she began to work in a clothing manufacturing enterprise, to which she owes her enterprising experience, which began 11 years later and which has not ended. Irene began a dressmaking business in her own home. Her husband continues to make wooden furniture, and does so independently.  \r\n\r\nIrene has received 17 loans through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo during her 16 years of  association with this organization. Through those years, she has formalized her activity, and increased household income, and she has added sales of cosmetics by means of specialized guides. With this \u201ccredikiva\u201d loan #18, she will buy cloth and sewing supplies, plus cologne and underwear, currently at a discount during a merchandise promotion.\r\n\r\nIrene's long-range dream is to visit Germany, the country of her husband's family. At medium-range, she plans to continue working, in order to have a store well stocked with the merchandise that sells best in her neighborhood. Her great challenge is competition that responds rapidly to customer orders. But she emphasized that her products are of better quality than her competitors offer. For that reason, she holds onto her market. Now, her accounts must be paid every 5 days, her inventories sell each 9 days, and her profitability on sales is no less than 30%.

This communal bank has 9 members; most of this area\u2019s residents raise livestock.\r\n\r\nIsidora L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez is the group representative.  She is a hard working, 34 year old woman, married to Fidel P\u00e9rez L\u00f3pez who raises cattle.  She has four children who are 14, 8, 5 and 1 respectively; two of them go to school.\r\n\r\nIsidora sells fruit and vegetables like: tomatoes, onions, chilies, bananas, apples, potatoes, mandarins, garlic, and eggs, among others.  This is why she requested a loan: to buy more vegetables and thus higher profits because lately sales have been very low and she does not earn enough to restock and sometimes there\u2019s just money enough to eat.  She\u2019s been selling these products at home for ten years.\r\n\r\nAnother group member is Mrs. Zoila Hern\u00e1ndez , 54.  She is married to Mr. Juan L\u00f3pez who is a farmer.  She has 5 children four of whom are married and one who passed away.  She has four little children dependent on  her since her daughter, their mother, died a year ago.  She works very hard to provide food for them.  She has to go out to sell all kinds of articles for the home and clothing door-to-door in different towns.  Zoila works very hard to support her grandchildren.  Despite her age, she\u2019s a strong woman who has worked for over 30 years.  She used to be in other activities.  She asked for the loan to buy more products like: trays, plates, glasses, spoons, soap dishes and buckets to have a bit more stock and earn a bit more profit because the money her husband earns is insufficient.  Since he\u2019s a farmer he only earns money when he harvests and sells his fruit and sometimes the harvest is just barely enough for them to feed themselves.  Zoila is very grateful to the people who provide help to humble people like them; that lend them money so that they can continue working.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are:\r\n\r\nIsidora

En tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los peones quienes se encargan de extraer con mayor rapidez los frutos de cada producto y de esa manera logra avanzar con mayor celeridad en cuanto a su trabajo. Se siente muy comprometido con su labor; porque  gracias a su esfuerzo cotidiano hoy disfruta al ver que los frutos de sus plantas le resultan, as\u00ed obteniendo buenas ganancias por cada kilogramo de producto vendido; cuenta que la  estaci\u00f3n de invierno no es de su agrado porque en estos meses abundan los insectos y las precipitaciones de las lluvias as\u00ed impidiendo el rendimiento de su trabajo y perjudicando a los frutos de sus plantaciones. El cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para contratar jornaleros quienes le apoyar\u00e1n en las extracciones de sus cultivos. M\u00e1s adelante planea aumentar sus sembrios con plantas de barbasco ya que los inversionistas Coreanos por primera vez aperturaron un empresa de tratamiento y envasado con plantas de barbasco. Este es su octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y espera poder pagarlo a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarles problemas a los compa\u00f1eros de su banco comunal, en donde es muy respetado debido al orden que le impone al grupo. Con los tres mil soles, contratar\u00e1 jornaleros para que le brinden el apoyo con las extracciones de caf\u00e9 y barbasco.\n\n","en":"V\u00edctor is 44 years old and comes from Santa Rosa district.  He is a very cheerful and successful man who is married to 38 year-old Severina and has 5 children.  They live together in their own home.\r\n\r\nV\u00edctor worked on his parents' land from a very early age.  His passion for crops led him to acquire his own land which he has been working independently for 20 years.  He grows coffee, cacao and barbasco root (a native plant).  In total, he owns 6 hectares of land.  During harvest time, he is supported by laborers who help him to extract the fruit from each of his crops more quickly so that he can advance swiftly in his work.  V\u00edctor feels very committed to his work because, thanks to his daily effort, he can see the fruits that his plants are producing and knows that he will make good profits on every kilogram of produce he sells.\r\n\r\nV\u00edctor tells us that he doesn't like the winter season because insects are prolific at that time of year and there is a lot of rain which hampers his production and damages the fruits on his plantations.  V\u00edctor will use the loan he is requesting to hire laborers who will support him in harvesting his crops.  In the future, he plans to increase his barbasco plantings as, for the first time, Korean investors have opened a barbasco packing and processing company.\r\n\r\nThis is V\u00edctor's eighth loan from MFP and he hopes to be able to repay it on time since he doesn't want to cause trouble for the other members of his community bank where he is a respected member as a result of the order that he brings to the group.  He will use his 3,000 Peruvian soles to hire laborers to help him in harvesting his coffee and barbasco root."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":741781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers to help him harvest his coffee and barbasco root","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-29T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3023.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621110,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-30T16:11:38Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":286563,"name":"Benemerito Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En Pueblo Nuevo de los Angeles se encuentra el grupo de Benemerito, cerca de la casa de do\u00f1a Marybel esta una presa grandisima y la gente viene a pescar y tambien hay gente que todavia viene a lavar su ropa, es una comunidad indigena y por eso existen estas costumbres todavia, Do\u00f1a Marybel se dedica a la engorda de reces, y solicit\u00f3 su prestamo para comprar el alimento como zacate molido y engordar los toros, no cr\u00eda reces solo las engorda para que en poco tiempo pueda venderlas, ya tiene un cliente que semana tras semana le compra una res, uno de los desafios que enfrento en mi negocio es que el zacate cada dia es mas caro y yo nesecito bastante para que mis reces engorden bien, pero yo ya no le puedo subir mas al precio de mi res para que me recupere porque si lo hago ya no me la compran, el prestamo va beneficiar mucho porque me voy apoyar para invertir en otra res y comprar el alimento lo que hago es darle vuelta al dinero para que salgan las ganancias, las metas que tengo es que con mi negocio pueda mejorar mi casa, arreglarla con las cosas que hacen falta y tambien para mis hijos, que tengo 4 estudiando, en total son 6 pero dos ya trabajan, tengo 21 a\u00f1os de casada, la casa es propia y mi esposo es comerciante, el incremento en las ganancias me ayuda porque quiero comprar una lap-top que nesecita mi hijo que va en la preparatoria y haga sus tareas.

Near Marybel's home there is a very large dam and people come there to fish.  Some still come there to wash their clothes.  This is an indigenous community and so these customs still survive.  Marybel's business is fattening cattle.  She requested her loan to buy ground feed to fatten her bulls.  She does not raise cattle but fattens them so that she can sell them a short while later.  She already has customers who buy a cow from her week after week.\r\n\r\n\"One of the challenges I have faced in my business is that feed is becoming more and more expensive and I need quite a lot so that my cattle put on a good amount of weight.  However, I can't increase the price of my cattle any further in order to make this money back because if I do they won't buy from me any more.  The loan will help me a lot because it will help me to invest in another cow and buy feed.  What I do is I use the money so that I can make profits from it.  My goals are to work in my business so that I can improve my home and fix it up with the things that it lacks.  I also want to provide for my four children who are studying (I have six children in total but two of them are already working).  I have been married for 21 years, I own my own home and my husband is a salesman.  The increase in profits will help me because I would like to buy a laptop that my son needs.
