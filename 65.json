She noticed that her neighborhood lacked small grocery stores and decided to invest a bit of her savings to open up one.  This small business has allowed her to cover food costs for her dear children.  She believes that increasing the variety of products and merchandise will ultimately be useful to her family.  While she dedicates her time running the store and taking care of her children, her husband Lorenzo works at an auto mechanic shop.

And being that they had no other source of income and he couldn\u2019t find a new job, Mirna and her husband, with some money he got from his unemployment compensation, started a small candy store. Fortunately, the candies were a success in their neighborhood. That was why shortly after Mirna\u2019s husband got a new job, she took over the store. Mirna\u2019s mother-in-law lent her a small locale so that they could better establish the business. After that, she introduced more variety to her products such as bread, groceries and beverages, among other things.\r\n\r\n<P>Sadly, however, several clients begin asking to borrow credit, and Mirna, with all the will to generate sales, would accept their offers but many people did not follow through. Now Mirna has neither sufficient merchandise nor the money to restock. That is why she is requesting a loan of $925, which she is willing to repay in 6 months. With that money, Mirna will be able to buy more merchandise to keep her business running and recover from that problem. \u201cI plan to sell to my debtors for cash only and not by credit,\u201d she commented.

The community, situated in one of the lowest parts of the department of Huancavelica, at only 6,500 ft above sea level at the borders of the Mantaro river, has, compared to other parts of the department of Huancavelica, a warm almost tropical climate. The warm climate and the vicinity of the river make the area very suitable for growing fruits like oranges, lemons, avocado, papaya and mango. Besides the fruits, most of the people dedicate their time raising guinea-pigs, which are considered a delicacy.\r\n<p>\r\nThe bank was formed recently with 13 female borrowers and therefO. has no history\u2026yet. It has only just started to create history in its community. The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating is to invest in their business\u00b4 or for the education of their children, buying school uniforms, supplies, books and even to pay the fee for entering primary or secondary school.  \r\n<p>\r\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the area is known for guinea-pig raising and for fruit production. With only a few exceptions, the members of the community bank dedicate their time to both activities. Some of the members are investing their loan in new fruit plants, others need the loan for raising the guinea-pigs. Of the exceptions in the group, 2 have a small grocery stO. and another has a \u201ccafetin\u201d, a small kiosk selling sweets, drinks and sandwiches at a school in a neighboring city.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery member has a different testimony, as is the case of Cristina C. D. M.. Cristina maD. her loan request of 200 soles to be able to buy new fruit plants and fertilizer. Antonia F. D. M., the group\u00b4s democratically elected President, has another purpose for her loan of 600 soles: increasing her stO. with mO. supplies like rice, sugar, soft drinks and beer. Alberta A. R., the woman with the smallest loan in the group (with 100 soles), will invest in food for her guinea-pigs. She will buy special food to be able to raise high quality guinea-pigs. The guinea-pigs can be sold in cities nearby: Huanta and Ayacucho.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough many women dedicate their time to the same business, they require different loan sizes because of the differences in the size of the business they run. The loans range from 100 soles, 200 soles, up to 600 soles and the total of the loans reach 4,300 soles among the 13 members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":117364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Leader's loan use: buy more supplies for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-01-19T15:35:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caillahua Mariluz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tadea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-02T20:44:05Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4300,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":716.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":716.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":716.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":716.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":716.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":716.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":246,"local_amount":717.15,"processed_date":"2008-03-02T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":725.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147453,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":246,"local_amount":717.15,"processed_date":"2008-04-02T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":725.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171739,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":246,"local_amount":717.15,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":725.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198974,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":246,"local_amount":717.15,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":725.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225884,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":246,"local_amount":717.15,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":725.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255227,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":245,"local_amount":714.24,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":722.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283961,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-19T20:44:05Z","paid_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":32407,"name":"Socorro Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"\"Although I am a sales employee in a business that makes plastic colorings, my salary is not enough\", commented Socorro Guadalupe.

F\u00e1tima\u201d is a rural community bank in FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari project, which provides credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, such as being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVirgen D. F\u00e1tima\u201d is located in the small community of La Merced in the province of Churcampa, at over 9,000 ft above sea level. Currently the bank has completed 2 loan cycles after just one year of existence.  Currently there are 20 female borrowers. \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the bank, during their one year in FINCA Peru, besides having learned to be responsible and punctual, have learned to respect each other and to help another member of the group when they face some kind of difficulty. At each bi-weekly reunion a different member of the group prepares a small meal that she will sell for 1 sol (about 35 cents U.S!), and the profit she will add to her savings in the bank.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group was able to save over 4,900 soles (about 1,600 US$) in the first 2 loan cycles and will continue to save in the future.  For all members, the main use of the savings is for investing in their business or for the education of their children.  Another dream they have for the use of their savings is to be able to make renovations to their houses, like constructing another floor or changing the roof to a more sustainable material.\r\n<p>\r\nMost members of the community bank run the same business: they have fields with corn, wheat and peas. And a little bit lower down at the Mantaro river basin, where it\u2019s a little warmer, they grow fruits like oranges and mango.  There is one special fruit they cultivate: the fruit of the tuna-cactus. As all of these product are seasonal, they also have mountain goats and minor animals like chickens and guinea-pigs. Most of the products they sell weekly at the local market of Churcampa or a little further away in Huanta. Two also run grocery stores in the community. \r\n<p>\r\nThe loans range from 200 soles, 500 soles up to 600 soles and the total of the loans reach 5,100 soles among the 20 members. The amounts of 500 and 600 soles are exceptions.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough many dedicate their time to the same business, every member has a different testimony, as is the case of Perpetua Murga A.. Perpetua was the woman that formed the bank in its first cycle and was elected the first president. With her 600 soles loan she will buy new supplies for her grocery store. And with her 450 soles of savings she will hire someone to make holes in the ground to put new tara and tuna-cactus plants\r\n<p>\r\nMarcelina M. V. will invest her 200 soles buying plants of the tuna-cactus and of tara. Both need time to grow before they get productive (tuna 1 year and tara 3 years). Meanwhile she will depend on her mountain-goats: the sells them for the meat, but also she makes cheese from goat-milk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":117372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Buy new inventory for grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-01-19T15:35:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perpetua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Livia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anatolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edmunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Dometila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillerma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tereza Fortunata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-02T20:09:09Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5100,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-03-02T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147454,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-04-02T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171740,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198975,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225885,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255228,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":290,"local_amount":845.14,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":855.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283962,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-19T20:09:09Z","paid_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":32412,"name":"Martha Alicia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"With the goal of supporting her four children and being able to offer them a better future, by offering them the chance to study in university, Martha started looking for a way to obtain an extra income because with what her husband makes as a driver in a lumber yard, it is not enough to pay for their children's school expenses.

Her husband is a truck driver who is often on the road and away from home.  When he's away, there are sometimes long gaps when he can't send money to cover the children's expenses.  Consequently, Luz began helping a cousin sell cosmetics from a catalog with the goal of having an income to cover her family's daily expenses.  Later, she decided to start her own business selling cosmetics and shoes bought from catalogs.  Little by little, she's been able to build her business.  She can now count on a list of customers who seek her out to buy her products.\r\n<p>\r\nSince her customers have placed various orders that Luz can't now provide, she's applying for a US$550 loan, to be repaid over 6 months, that she can use to buy new products to offer her customers.  With your help, Luz will be able to push her family ahead.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLuz Mar\u00eda es madre de unos peque\u00f1os.

was born in 1969, she is married and has 4 children. Three of the kids are girls who, together with Hurmatvi, sew izori, a type of pants made out of warm fabrics and worn as part of the national costume. Hurmatvi then sells the izori at the Korvon market in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan. During her own childhood, Hurmatvi had helped her grandmother to make national Tajik clothes. Nowdays, since her own family was forced to find additional income as there is not enough money for family needs, Hurmatvi taught her daughters this craft and now they all sew izori for sale. Hurmatvi has many loyal customers who she was able to attract because of the quality of her sewing and the sturdiness of the seams. She sells about 10-20 izori daily and her garments cost much less then imported clothes.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

He is married and has 4 children. His store is located at the Korvon market in Dushanbe, capital of Tadjikistan. To the question as to why he chose to sell this type of goods he responded that he likes to come up with designs for handbags. He has a creative soul and enjoys picking out his wares on his trips to China to restock. In the future he is hoping to open a handbag making workshop and for this purpose he is having his son study at the university as a leather goods designer. Currently the goods turnaround at his store is very fast and he is saving up money for the workshop for his son. He would like to use the loan from Kiva in order to buy additional shipments of handbags to expand his selection.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva
