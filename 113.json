She achieved this with the help of her husband, but due to many problems she decided to separate from him and continue on her own.  This diligent mother continued working for the good and tranquility of her children.  Now she relies on the unconditional support of her children, who, after finishing their studies actively help her in making the clothing.  This hardworking family is able to make a large number of shirts each week, which are sold wholesale in the city of Cuzco.

Over a period of years, this little general store has become one of the busiest in town.

Kokou A. was born in Gbatop\u00e9 in the Zio prefecture on December 31, 1986. He is married and has two children. From a young age he learned how to make shoes because he had a passion for it. Since 1993, he has operated a shoemaking shop in the city of Lom\u00e9 where he purchases, on-site, everything that he needs to make shoes. He takes orders and also sells his shoes at expositions. His shoes are in high demand, but due to his insufficient working capital, he is unable to meet customer demand. Therefore, he got the idea to take out his first loan to increase his working capital so he can buy raw materials to make shoes, such as lizard skins, soles, and buffalo hides.\r\n<b><p>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nMonsieur A.

She never received an education, but she knows how to get by in life. Starting in 2004, she got into the charcoal business, a field in which she is an expert.

She buys charcoal from the surrounding villages that she then resells in Lom\u00e9. The only problem that Mrs. Ofriman has encountered is that she does not have enough money to buy sufficient quantities of charcoal. She has to travel often to buy charcoal, which increases her costs.

The loan that we are asking for is very important because we need to acquire more prime materials because lately, the prices of these materials have been going up, and it has made it a little difficult to stay in business since we have low stock, so we need to stock up on materials.\r\n\r\nOur group is formed of: Nely Suyapa C., \u201cI have made and sold tortillas for five years, during which I have had my daughters\u2019 help making tortillas.  I have struggled the whole time, because I am a single mother and my work doesn\u2019t allow me to take care of my children and home;\u201d \u201cJose H., who has a glass store and makes lattices, display cases and everything related to windows.  He has been dedicated to this business for five years, and the money he makes helps him fulfill his obligations and satisfy his household needs.  Wilmer A. has a glass store, and has been in this business for two years, during which time he has been the only wage-earner in his family.\r\n\r\nWe are all asking for your financial support so that we can move forward with our businesses and our families.  Thanks!\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Zach Frey, Kiva volunteer.\r\nhola nuestro grupo se llama NUEVO PARAISO estamos ubicados en barrio el Jazmin del municipio del Paraiso, nosotros nos conocemos muy bien ya que somos vecinos de varios a\u00f1os y todos nos tenemos mucho aprecio. con este credito que estamos solicitando sera de mucha importancia porque necesitamos adquirir mas materia prima ya que en estos ultimos dias se ha encarecido la compra de estos materiales y hace un poco dificil tener en existencia ya que el capital de trabajo es muy poco por tal razon necesitamos abastecernos de materiales. nuestro grupo esta conformado por: Nely Suyapa C.: elaboro y vendo tortillas, actividad que tengo de realizar hace 5 a\u00f1os, tengo la ayuda de mis hijas para la elaboracion de las tortillas, durante todo este tiempo he tenido que luchar para salir adelante porque soy madre soltera y este negocio me permite atender mis hijas y mi hogar.

Most of her previous loans had been invested in breeding cattle but the profit was not as high as she expected.  Therefore, recently she has borrowed more money to open a small store selling salt.  Every morning, her husband would purchase salt from the seaside and she would resell it to other stores and customers in the area, earning roughly 3 million VND monthly.  Apart from this business, her family is still raising cattle and work on the field (but less than before).  Due to a stable source of income, she has been able to repay all the loans on time and still able to pay for her children education and living expenses.  Currently, the price of salt is low so she would like to borrow money to buy more and put in reserve to sell later.  This cycle she would like to borrow 6 million VND.  Her family income monthly is about 3.5 million VND.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh H.

In order to have more fund to make tofu, and to breed animals, Mrs. Y. applied to become a member in 2004.  Upon participation, Mrs. Y. has always used her loan to buy materials to make tofu.  Since there is always demand for this product in her village, Mrs. Y. has a very consistent income.  She also uses the byproducts from making tofu, as well as other food in her garden, to raise pigs, order to increase her family income.  Besides profit from tofu making, Mrs. Y. earns an extra 8,000,000 VND (equivalent to 500 USD) from animals breeding.

When she joined the Fund in 1998, her family\u2019s financial conditions encountered many difficulties. Her husband had died early, when all children were still young and there was not enough capital to make a living. After joining the Fund, she borrowed money to buy and resell scrap. Over her 10 years of participation to the Fund, she managed to raise all the children thanks to her assiduous work and thriftiness. The 3 eldest children are now grown up and her family\u2019s economy has improved significantly. The children currently work in the family\u2019s carpentry business. For the next round, she would like to borrow 10.000.000 \u0111 for the children to purchase a new sawing machine, and use the remainder of the loan to buy scrap.

She joined the Fund in 2003, asking for a loan to invest into her fruit shop at the market. Every day, she buys fruit from large retailers and resells them to the locals. Over 5 years, the funds for her fruit shop allowed her to expand the business. As of today, her family\u2019s income from the fruit business amount to around 2.500.000\u0111 per month. In order to improve further the family\u2019s income, her husband regularly works as a general labourer for a regular income of 1.500.000\u0111 per month. Thus her family\u2019s conditions are very stable and they were able to raise 2 kids. She also managed to build a spacious storey house and buy a set of valuable appliances.

After that, she was more confident to borrow and expand this model of rearing pigs. Currently, she is also raising chickens and ducks. Besides raising livestocks, her husband also carries out transportation service so their family's income is stable. Her 2 grown-up children also have stable jobs.

As she was hardworking and always tried to save, she overcame all the difficulties to raise her children as well as to stabilise the family's economy.

Mindful of her role in the family and being without any sort of occupational training, five years ago she plunged into distribution of various products, in particular, women\u2019s handbags, shoes, soap, and shirts, amongst others.  At the outset, she marketed food products, but she discontinued that practice because she found it too cumbersome and instead went into traveling sales. Thanks to the income from that business, she has been able to assist her husband in supporting the family. Initially she purchased her inventory at the Dantokpa international market in Cotonou, but now, she finds it more profitable to head for the Lome city market in the neighboring country of Togo, where merchandise is less expensive.
