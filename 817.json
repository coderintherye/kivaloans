He is 55 years old and has been married to Marcelina, who is a homemaker, for 38 years.  The couple live in the town of San Felipe del Progreso.  This is a town that has all the public services its people need.  The couple have four children, only one of whom is still dependent on them.  He is in his fifth year of elementary school.  Jes\u00fas has an electromechanical workshop in the town center.  He is a very hard-working and entrepreneurial person.  Although he was not able to attend school owing to the fact that there weren't many opportunities to do so when he was young, he is a person with big ideas and a great desire to do well in life.  On this occasion, he is requesting a loan to buy a field where he can grow corn, barley and beans.  He has two years experience in this business of growing crops and he tells us that he has taken the decision to buy this field because he used to work in a way which is commonly referred to as doing work by 'going halves'.  This is when one person sets up the field and another person sows the seeds and works the land.  When harvest time comes round, half of the harvested crops go to the owner of the field and the other half goes to the person who worked the land.  Although this worked well for him, he realized that he could do better if he bought his own field because this would mean that all the harvested crops would be his.  Jes\u00fas will sow crops in his field.  Some of the harvested crops will be for his own consumption and he will turn some into fertilizer.

With the granted loan, Rufina will buy wool fabric, embroidery fabric, Madeja-style yarn, needles, scissors, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of Rufina\u2019s greatest difficulties is that their type of crafts hardly sell anymore because people don\u2019t want to pay the prices quoted to customers; they think they are too expensive and often their work is undervalued.  Rufina relates that it takes from 20 days to a month depending on the item to be made to complete said items.\r\n\r\nThe loan that FRAC and Kiva will provide for the Las Artesanas del Fresno group is of great help for them because often they are unable to buy the materials they need to make their items.

He has a store and a bread bakery located in the same place in the town of Soledad, where he lives. When he started his business life he did it selling fritters in different points of sale and 2 years ago he acquired his store. There he sells lunches, groceries, produce and general family basic items. Little by little he bought more active capital and created his own bread bakery where he is working with a lot of success. In his bakery  business he is paid up front and makes the bread and other products himself. He is helped by an employee with the sales in the store.  His goal for the future is to acquire his own locale so that he is not subject to instability, like he is when renting. Right now he plans to access a Kiva loan, the first loan he has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy raw materials to make bread and basic gamily basket items to stock his store. The success of this investment lies in the fact that he has working capital to make additional purchases to the ones he usually makes and thus he can offer interesting products that the family's in his neighborhood consume in well stocked display cases.

Hip\u00f3lito is 45 years old and married to Juana.  He still has four children who depend on them and their 13 year old daughter is still attending school.  Hip\u00f3lito and his family work baking bread to sell.  He\u2019s asked for the loan to buy flour, milk, yeast and firewood because although he lives in a place where trees abound he cannot cut the trees down and firewood must be brought from another state.\r\n\r\nHe described to us how he makes the bread:  \u201cFirst I knead the dough until it\u2019s shaped to make bread.  Then I separate the dough into 120 gram portions for each piece of bread.  In another spot the bread is shaped usually into rounds but I also choose which will be made: small, large and medium.  Once formed they pass into the wood-burning oven where I have to be watchful and very careful while they are baking turning them over and over again so that they don\u2019t burn.\u201d\r\n\r\nHip\u00f3lito has been baking mountain bread for a long time.  He learned from his grandfather when he was 8 years old and when he turned 15 he started his own business.  \u201cThe problem I face is that often resources are lacking since flour is very expensive.  On the other hand, we are not allowed to touch the wood and I have to bring it in from someplace else and it is super expensive that way.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of his goals is to have a mixer to make the bread more easily because by producing more his profits will increase.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very grateful for the loan authorized by FRAC and KIVA because it\u2019s very difficult to get loans from  other financial institutions because the interest rates they charge are very high.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1054745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"\r\nto buy flour, sugar, milk, firewood and yeast.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guadalupe Cote, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hitolipo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":597.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":611.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":639.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":670.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":685.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":701.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":718.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":734.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":752.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":769.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":787.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":805.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":824.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":843.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":863.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":883.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":904.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":925.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408730,"name":"Essam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Essam is from Gaza.

group is called \u201cEmiliano Zapata Jicayan\u201d and is composed of four indigenous women from San Juanito Jicayan, a pretty town inhabited by honorable people.  Just outside of San Juanito there is a large river with green trees.  The members of this group speak Mixteco and they tell us that they are proud of being from San Juanito and of their culture and language.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Irlanda, a 26 year old, hardworking woman.  She tells us that she considers herself to be a hardworking, humble woman who wants to improve herself.  She sells candy and food like: chicken turnovers, tostadas, fried tacos and sopes [a circle of fried masa with pinched sides. This is then topped with refried beans and crumbled cheese, lettuce, onions, red or green sauce and sour cream. \r\n\r\nShe relates one of her work experiences:\r\n\r\nShe relates that she used to just sell candy at a school but with support from the Fundaci\u00f3n she bought ingredients to prepare dishes like: green chili, dried chilies, tomatoes, onions, cheese, cold cuts, string cheese and corn to make tortillas.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her business is that little by little and with work she\u2019s made it grow and with her same profits to prepare more dishes.  She tells us that she sells the food she prepares and the candy at a school in her community and what she likes best is selling at school trusting that she\u2019s providing the children with good food and caring for them since she helps them wash their hands and to eat tasty food comfortably. She will use the loan to buy more ingredients to prepare food, candy and fruit so that the school children will also eat fruit.\r\n\r\nShe thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping her and making her dreams a reality as well as the dreams of the children since she, as a mother, works for her son, Arisbel, and just like she works so too there are many other parents that work for their children\u2019s future.  She tells us that she feels fortunate to have the Fundaci\u00f3n\u2019s support.\r\n\r\nThe other members are:\r\nFabiola-will sell perfume.\r\nMaria-sells groceries.\r\nGuadalupe-sells fast food snacks.\r\n\r\nThey thank the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping them improve their lives since they want to provide better lives for their children so that they can have better educations and thus better futures.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1054849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for food preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Juan Jicayan, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabiola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irlanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3391.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3584.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3725.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3922.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4285.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408744,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Flora, 43, resident of Bacoor, Cavite city, Philippines.

Her business is based out of her apartment.  She purchases materials for her business such as rubber, fique fiber, micro suit fabric, insoles, and packing material.  She designs the shoes and then takes the materials to a cobbler who makes the shoes for her.  Once the shoes are finished Beatriz packs them up and delivers them to her customers.  She also makes handbags, though that is a smaller part of her business.  She sells her items for cash and for credit.  Beatriz gets new customers through the Internet, on Facebook, in street markets, and by handing out fliers and business cards.  She also sells to two stores in Santa Marta.  The competition is low, and she meets the competition with the quality of her products, her success in fulfilling orders, and the overall satisfaction of her customers.  Her shoes are very beautiful and original with ecological patterns.  Her business has directly created two jobs\u2014hers and the cobbler\u2019s\u2014and contributes to the business of the two vendors who sell her products in the city of Santa Marta.         \r\n\r\nBeatriz has an excellent financial record.

She will use it to maintain a cash fund for purchasing the materials she needs to produce shoes and handbags, which she will sell wholesale and retail.

This group is made up of five men and two women, who are very friendly and helpful.  They are very sociable, like to joke around, and are very accessible to each other, but above all they are very responsible.

He has six years of experience in this.  Every week or two when he needs merchandise, he goes to a community very near to his village which is called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec.  Here he stocks up on everything he needs.  He goes door-to-door selling his products, and on occasion, he sells in the market.  He decided to start up this business as he was working in Mexico City, and when his job terminated he found himself unemployed and needed to support his family.\r\n\r\n\"The only problem, as always, is the lack of money\", comments Don Alfredo.  He says that he also works growing vegetables, mainly cilantro, radishes, cauliflower and broccoli.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Alfredo is a very hard-working and responsible man who needs a financial boost.

Nawal has worked as a tailor for 10 years. She started her business to help her husband make a living and raise their children. She stopped working for a few years when she found out that her children needed a lot of care and attention, but two years ago Nawal felt lonely since all of her children got married and she was left alone during the day busy with nothing to prepare for the kids who were supposed to be back home for lunch or dinner.\r\n\r\nSo working again was the best thing for her to improve her social life in addition to supporting her family again with additional income for whoever needs help. She is very happy that she took this path again, and she is willing to open a big factory in the future. Today, Nawal is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy a new and improved tailoring machine capable of doing a lot of work in a very short amount of time with especially good quality.\r\n\r\nKhadija is a 25-year-old married woman and mother of three gorgeous children who fill her whole life, and for whom she sacrifices hers in order to please them and provide them with the best living ever. Three years ago, Khadija started to work as a hairdresser. She faced a lot of problems and complaints from her husband at the beginning since he refused to let her work and start her own business. But at the same time, she had her husband's family's support, which helped a lot in taking the first step. Her business started at home, since her husband spends most of his time away and she had to fill her free time and at the same time stay next to her children. Most of her customers are friends, relatives and neighbors. Khadija is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy necessary hair colors, a new hairdryer and necessary hair dressing tools to improve her business. She hopes that one day she will open her own beauty salon and all of her customers will support her there too since they are very loyal to her. She is sure that her husband, although he refused at the beginning, is very proud of her now.\r\n\r\nZalfa is a 43-year-old married woman and mother of three children. Zalfa has been working in the Mouneh business for 13 years. She inherited her business from her mother who used to do it in her village. That's what encouraged her to start this business in her husband's village. Zalfa makes jam, she prepares Mouneh during the summer months to be consumed during winter\u2019s harsh days. This way of preserving food helps foods to live a longer life. The Mouneh food has started in time to be a basic food for most of the Lebanese. Her business is improving and now is the suitable time to start working since everything is almost available to start preparing. That's why, to be ready for customers' replies, Zalfa is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy necessary goods such as vegetables, fruits and seeds , to start her preparations.

nine kind, working women who run different businesses.  The members of the group live in a village called Camotinchan which has many green trees and a wide, beautiful river winding through it called \"Los Tres\" (because it has three streams).\r\n\r\nMost of the men in the community grow corn, sesame, chili pepper, and tomato; and the women sell chicken, shoes and beef.  In the culture of Camotinchan, during carnival the boys and girls dance in the streets in their community.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Mrs. Josellesica, a cheerful, hard-working woman who wants to help her family.  She is known as Jessica among the group members and people in her communty.  She sells Mexican snacks, gelatin, water, fresh fruit and sweets at the high school in her community.  She says she has been selling there for two years, and before that she sold her goods at the kindergarten for thirteen years. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Jessica, 32, is happily married to Ignacio, a humble, hard-working man who is a farmer.  They have three children, Jonatan, 16, Javier, 13 and Alexander, 2, who are their greatest inspiration.\r\n\r\nJessica tells us that what she likes most about her business is cooking for the youngsters and treating them well.  She says her workday is as follows: she takes her goods to the high school and when the students begin recess she sells them food and fruit.

They maintain their culture and traditions.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Mar\u00eda Eugenia who lives in Misicata sector, in the city of Cuenca.  She is 21 years old, married, and doesn't yet have any children.  Her husband is a construction worker.  They do not own their own home but live in rental accommodation.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Eugenia studied in a sewing academy for three years and has been working in her profession for one year.  She works in a factory that makes jeans, from Monday to Saturday, from 7.00am to 6.00pm.  In her free time she sells Teans-brand natural products.  She has been in this business for two years.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda Eugenia's first loan from her community bank which she was invited to join by her mother-in-law.  She will invest her loan in buying natural products so that she can continue working in her business.  Her goal is to own her own home.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, we are joined in the photo by a young man in a black t-shirt who is the son of one of the members."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1053582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"to buy natural products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":3850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Esthela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Elvia Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diego Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3850,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":320.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-02T11:27:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408878,"name":"Dounia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dounia is a 33-year-old Lebanese woman.

This city experiences hot weather year round and is visited by a large number of tourists as it is home to the 'Huacachina Lake', an oasis in the middle of the desert which has some beautiful dunes.  It is also a city where there is a lot of agriculture, particularly cotton, grape and asparagus cultivation.

He works around 10 hours a day and serves around 30 customers a day.  He also has a motorcycle taxi that he bought with a lot of effort. He sometimes hires it out and this makes him a small amount of extra income.

His primary work is fattening up livestock.  He also has land, where he grows vegetables.  Every time he buys and sells livestock, he uses the resulting profit to buy vegetable seeds and plants them.  This time, he has an order for cucumber and tomato seedlings.  Imonali plans to use this loan to buy another calf, and when the time comes to sell, he would sell a cow.  He lives with his mother and children, and his wife is working in Russia.  It is customary in their village that the youngest son lives with his parents, and this is why he started to build a house to ensure that his sons would not be in need and be provided with a house in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1054042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase and resell livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imonali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1611.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1722.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
