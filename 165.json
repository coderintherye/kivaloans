T., B. Neneh J., J. B. Neneh, Fatmata T. and Mamai T.. They named their group The Truth.  They are all local entrepreneurs in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. This is their fourth loan from Kiva through SMT. Previously, each one of them in the group received a loan of 800,000 Leones (a little over USD$250). That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Now, they are requesting a loan of 1,000,000 Leones each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nAnjay (left) is the leader of the group. He is thirty-nine years of age. He was born in Makeni. His wife is a businesswoman and the two have four children \u2013 two in secondary school and two in primary school. He has been a businessman for over 10 years now. Anjay owns a small, local recording studio where he also sells tapes. He will use this new loan to buy two more cassette recorders and blank and non-blank tapes. The tape recorders, locally referred to as Simba, will cost him 350,000 Leones in Freetown. He will be using one of the tapes to play songs and the other for recording songs.\r\n\r\nTraveling to Freetown so often to buy the tapes is the only major challenge facing Anjay in his business. He hates traveling so often and whenever he runs out of tapes, he is forced to make the trek to Freetown to buy the required number of tapes needed to replace the sold ones. But with this loan, the amount of traveling he\u2019ll have to do will diminish as he will be able to buy a lot of tapes in one trip.\r\n\r\nWith the increase in profit Anjay will make as a result of the loan, he will be able to develop his business by reinvesting the profit into the business. With more profit, he hopes to start including compact discs in his music collection."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":249930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs & Tapes","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy two more cassette recorders and blank and non-blank tapes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-12T19:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anjay A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenneh Bah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenneh Jalloh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":209.37,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":632521.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885078,"comment":null},{"amount":348.96,"local_amount":1041666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1054203.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128920,"comment":null},{"amount":186.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":562241.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025709,"comment":null},{"amount":302.43,"local_amount":902777.76,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":913642.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008513,"comment":null},{"amount":255.91,"local_amount":763888.92,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":773082.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230854,"comment":null},{"amount":186.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":562241.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662621,"comment":null},{"amount":186.11,"local_amount":555555.52,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":562241.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102858,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T03:58:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82145,"name":"Zaynab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaynab A.

Women Association Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Maseray K. and Marie K.. They named their group Wusum Women's Association (named after one of the two main hills in Makeni).  They are local entrepreneurs in Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone. They have received several loans from Kiva through SMT. Previous loans have created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees.  They\u2019re are also able to feed and cloth themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans.  Now, they are requesting a loan of Le 800,000 each, to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nMaseray K. (left) is the leader of the group. She is fifty-two years of age. She was born in Makari village, only five miles from Makeni. Her husband is a truck driver and the two of them have four children, all of whom are in secondary schools. Maseray has been a businesswoman for over fifteen years.\r\n \r\nMaseray sells firewood. Previously, she sold dishes, buckets and slippers, but bad debtors have forced her to change her business to firewood.  The firewood business is a no credit business.  It is a cash business only. She will use this new loan to expand her business by buying two truck loads of firewood. Usually, a truck load of firewood costs Le 500,000, including transportation. She travels to the back country of Binkolo, about seven miles from Makeni to purchase the wood.\r\n\r\nDuring the dry season, wood sellers like Maseray, encounter a drop in sales, which poses a great threat to her business. Sales drop in the dry season because trees are dry and many people can just chop one down and make their own firewood instead of buying wood in the market. Others simply go to a near-by bush and chop dry sticks and turn them into firewood. This is a challenge to her business and she has to face it head-on. Maseray uses her profit to pay school fees and other related expenses for her children, including medical care and food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":249948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand her business by buying two truck loads of firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-03T04:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maseray","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":1600000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":228571.43},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":228571.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":228571.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":228571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":228571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":228571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":228571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.36,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":584138.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885081,"comment":null},{"amount":42.35,"local_amount":123214.29,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":127954.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128923,"comment":null},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":228571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":237364.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025712,"comment":null},{"amount":235.72,"local_amount":685714.28,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":712092.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008515,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

The work becomes more difficult during the rainy season, which can cause the rickshaw not to run properly.  This is her 6th loan with MFP, as she is very punctual with her payments.  Silvia wishes to buy another motorcycle-rickshaw, as well as keep the current one in good working condition.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":250074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase of additional motorcycle-rickshaw","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-05T04:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":228.08},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":233.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":247.32},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":253.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":263.07},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":274.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76.03,"local_amount":228.08,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":235.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228297,"comment":null},{"amount":77.81,"local_amount":233.44,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":240.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423529,"comment":null},{"amount":82.44,"local_amount":247.32,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":255.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116791,"comment":null},{"amount":84.44,"local_amount":253.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":261.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011722,"comment":null},{"amount":87.69,"local_amount":263.07,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":271.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595328,"comment":null},{"amount":91.59,"local_amount":274.76,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":283.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989547,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-05T15:35:19Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82198,"name":"Sof\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sof\u00eda tiene 27 a\u00f1os, es madre de 4 hijos y vive junto a su conviviente quien le da la mano en todos sus prop\u00f3sitos.

She began by selling basic products in small quantities with a little of her own money, with the financial objective of increasing sales by offering her customers a variety of products. \r\n\r\nThanks to the loans from Afodenic she will be able to buy greater quantities of products such as staple grains, perfumes and cosmetics, canned food, personal hygiene products, and household items, generating higher income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":250195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of grains and various products to stock general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4046.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351541,"comment":null},{"amount":106.1,"local_amount":2070.22,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2094.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038879,"comment":null},{"amount":103.44,"local_amount":2018.38,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929175,"comment":null},{"amount":101.9,"local_amount":1988.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2011.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384087,"comment":null},{"amount":103.82,"local_amount":2025.84,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2049.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890550,"comment":null},{"amount":97.24,"local_amount":1897.23,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1919.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111847,"comment":null},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":2111.59,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:47:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2135.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533266,"comment":null},{"amount":199.28,"local_amount":3888.41,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3933.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964646,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-04T17:12:01Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:59:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82226,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lolita D. sells vegetables and other dry goods in Agusan Del Sur.

She is older but this does not limit her enthusiasm for preparing and selling food at a cafeteria.  The cafeteria is managed by a group of women from the community who sell food at low prices, within the reach of people from lower economic conditions. Three years ago Juana joined this group in order to earn a little money and do what she likes the most, cooking.  People tell her that her dishes are delicious and request her food.  The problem is that she is limited in not being able to satisfy the demands of the customers, due to a scarcity of resources available to prepare the food.  Juana has worked with MFP over the course of three loan cycles as she is an active and responsible member of her group.

This young woman has always looked for ways to help her parents and contribute to the household expenses.  A year ago she began selling cosmetics out of a catalog and has been doing very well.  She has been able to sell her beauty products at school to both her classmates and teachers, who are happy to work with Judith.  Each time her orders are larger.  In this business the most profitable strategy for her is to take advantage of sales and increase her inventory.  Once the sale is over she can sell the sale merchandise at full price, earning significant profits.  Although Judith is young, she is very mature and ready to assume the payments of her loan, which will be repaid using revenue from her business.  With the money from the loan she will purchase sale merchandise from the catalog and increase her inventory.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":251375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase merchandise and increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-08T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":167.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228306,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":167.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423538,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":167.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116800,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":167.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011731,"comment":null},{"amount":107.89,"local_amount":332,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":333.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989556,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-08T20:22:35Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82373,"name":"Kattia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kattia tiene 23 a\u00f1os, es casada y tiene una peque\u00f1a hija.

Until recently, Alicia had made her living selling popsicles, but she always dreamed of doing something more, and with her first loan she was able to leverage her working capital so quickly that she could soon afford a motorized vending cart. With her fierce drive to succeed, she rented out her cart and used the income to buy a washing machine and eventually, a freezer. Now she washes clothes and sells ice. With this next loan of 2,000 soles, which she will pay back in 4 months, Alicia will buy a new scooter which will help her to increase her sales.

Her husband works as a teacher at the Instituto Nacional del Occidente public school. Her intent is to expand her business to obtain a better income for her family, since their current situation is very difficult. Her wish is to have prosperity in her work to get her family ahead, and her dream is to overcome the obstacles she is presented with to see through her goals--just because they are small does not mean they are not important.\r\n\r\nHer economic activity is a grocery shop in which she sells products like candies, cookies, caramels, soft drinks and bread. Her business is located in her home. She has owned the business for two years, starting it because she needed to provide an income for her family.

Thanh Hoa City is the provincial capital of the Thanh Hoa Province, one of the poorest provinces in Vietnam.

She is 50 years old, married, and has two children: a 25-year-old daughter, who is a seamstress, and a 19-year-old son who is studying building construction at a technical college.  Her husband helps run the family business, a bicycle repair shop. When her children have the time, they also help repair bicycles.  \n\nAs with her previous two loans, both have been repaid on time and in full, Mrs. Phung will use her share of the loan to invest in her bicycle repair shop. More specifically, with her loan she will be able to buy 30 tires, 30 inner tubes, 20 baskets, 10 chain rings, and 40 brake cables.\n\nMrs. Phung will use the profits from her loan to pay her son's school fees, to buy chickens, and to provide for her family.\n\nThe $1,075 loan will be split equally between all six borrowers. The other borrowers in the group will use their share of the loan as follows: \n\n* Mrs. An is borrowing 3,079,800 Vietnamese Dong (approx. $181) to buy sandpaper and lacquer for her furniture refinishing business. She will also use some of the proceeds to pay her ten employees.\n\n* Mrs. Thu will use her share of the loan to buy pig meat, rice, and vegetables to make B\u00e1nh Kho\u00e1i (which is made of rice and vegetables) and B\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 (which consists of bacon and rice).\n\n* Mrs. Lan operates a street stall from which she sells cooked food.  She will use her share of the proceeds to purchase rice, pork, fish, vegetables and tofu for use in her business. \n\n* Both Mrs. Phuong and Mrs. D\u1ea7n are borrowing to buy vegetables to resell in

She began working to earn income: selling packaging materials in the market (to cover daily expenses), and later on selling cakes. After these commercial ventures, she decided 6 years ago to specialize in selling peanut butter. She has a great reputation and her principal customers are teachers who place an order with her every month and Malians living outside their country, especially in France, who frequently send her orders. \r\n\r\nTo make her peanut butter, she sorts through the shelled peanuts then roasts the peanuts before grinding them in a mill. After this is done, she puts the peanut butter in buckets containing 5 kg, 10 kg, or 20 kg. \r\n\r\nLooking to expand her working capital so as to keep up with ever-growing customer demand, she became a member of Soro Yiriwaso, a micro-finance institution with whom she is presently requesting her first loan. She intends to purchase 8 sacks of peanuts directly from the producers in the Kita area (the peanut capital of Mali). \r\n\r\nMrs. Koniba  D. sells on both a cash and a credit basis to a clientele composed principally of salaried employees. With this loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of 50,000 F CFA which will permit her to help her husband out with family expenses. Her dream is to be able to build a house. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":251660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of bags of peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-06T16:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koniba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440311,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135685,"comment":null},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033486,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620854,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019819,"comment":null},{"amount":38.65,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242589,"comment":null},{"amount":38.61,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678102,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112389,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028046,"comment":null},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873439,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.8,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":18572.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763199,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-06T17:30:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82481,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Y. has been selling vegetables in the local market of Babiani in the Western Region of Ghana, where she lives with her family.

Cameroon.  With this loan, Margaret plans to invest in her provisions store.  More specifically, she will add off-licence to the provisions store, purchase two phones for her callbox (telephone booth) business, firewood and raw foodstuffs.  \r\n \r\nThis is Margaret's fifth loan; she has been a member of GHAPE since September 21st, 2004. She has a great deal of experience in her provisions store business; added to that, she will be selling wholesale as well as retailing.  Over the years, her customers have increased on a regular basis. She also feels that she has an excellent site for her business. \r\n\r\nLast year Margaret was emotionally disturbed when her house was scattered by the council, and she had to carry her family to beg a house and sleep inside. Finally, Margaret was seriously attacked by thieves and carried everything in her provision store from which she struggled to recover.\r\n\r\nShe plans to repay the loan in 24 months and the first installment of repayment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement.\r\n\r\nThe profit from this loan will be used to pay her children's school fees.  She will also invest much of her profit back into her business.  The rest will be used to clothe her children well, provide medical assistance for her family, and feed her family.  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":251685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of corn, beans, groundnuts, oil, and firewood, call centre","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ngomgham, Bamenda, NW.

D. is 46 years old and married. Xiomara has two children, of the following ages: Her 16 year old son recently finished his fourth year of high school; her younger son, nine years old, finished fourth grade. Her husband is an accountant for the Enacal business. Her goal is to secure the necessary income for her investment (in her business) because the situation that we find ourselves in is very difficult, and the only form of help that now presents itself in this country are the microfinance institutions and the outside organizations that hold out their hands to us. Xiomara wants to try to advance each day so that she can improve her economic situation. Her dream is to grow her business to ensure her children will be able to continue their studies.\r\n\r\nXiomara's business is a general store in which are sold products such as: clothing, costume jewelry, shoes, and sandals. Her business is mobile. She has had her business for three years, which began with her own idea that she had to fight for. Because of this she began this business with few products and began to distribute her product but it didn't have (good) results. Not enough people (customers) paid for (bought) the merchandise, so later she decided to invest only in clothes and began to cater to her better customers to distribute her products. This loan is for operating expenses because she has to buy gold-plated (items) in Managua and men's clothing is in different places in Leon where they are sold in a favorable way. Xiomara is grateful to the Foundation and its partner organizations that are helping her get this loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Olivia Engkvist, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":251688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Operating expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-08T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xiomara Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.43,"local_amount":2141.61,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2222.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091958,"comment":null},{"amount":18.81,"local_amount":358.38,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":371.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985347,"comment":null},{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":836.44,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":868.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445963,"comment":null},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":852.28,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":884.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956605,"comment":null},{"amount":42.61,"local_amount":811.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":841.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055565,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":864.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599676,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":864.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035571,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":3333.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3459.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947982,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives with her parents and her two young children.  Two years ago, she started a business raising sheep, a business that has helped her increase her earnings because the market pays a premium for lamb.  She also has a few cows that produce milk, another product that sells well in the markets in and around the city, but a business that requires her to start very early in the morning because she has to collect the milk and sell it to her customers while it's fresh for their morning breakfasts.

Each case is about 80 soles, depending on the brand.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":251756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"Buy drinks for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-09T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":91.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228331,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":91.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423566,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116830,"comment":null},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":91.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011758,"comment":null},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":77.69,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":85.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595352,"comment":null},{"amount":31.62,"local_amount":90.31,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":99.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-10T00:03:05Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82534,"name":"Henriette","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Henriette M. est une veuve de 59 ans, m\u00e8re de 04 enfants dont 02 sont des handicap\u00e9s (visuel et moteur).

It is the regional capital of the tropical Amazonian department of Ucayali which is characterized by the meandering Ucayali River that flows north, meeting up with the Amazon and, eventually, the Atlantic Ocean.  Fifty years ago, Pucallpa was a tiny caser\u00edo or hamlet; but everything changed when the only paved highway leading into the Amazon region was built and Pucallpa became the gateway to the jungle at the road's end.  Since the mid-20th century, the city has sprung up and engulfed the surrounding \"caserios\".  Today the city is a bustling, hot metropolis with immigrants from all over Peru.<P>\r\n\r\nLupe is thirty-six years old and has been working with the Ucayali office of Manuela Ramos for over seven years.  She has one small son whom she supports through her sweets-selling business.  Lupe is requesting a loan of 2,000 Nuevo Soles to be repaid over six months.  Lupe plans to use the funds to purchase sweets and cakes to re-sell to her customers.  She plans to purchase \"paneton\", in particular; it is a popular, traditional cake that families eat especially during Christmas.

Fifty years ago, Pucallpa was a tiny caser\u00edo or hamlet; but everything changed when the only paved highway leading into the Amazon region was built and Pucallpa became the gateway to the jungle at the roads\u2019 end.  Since the mid-20th century, the city has sprung up and engulfed the surrounding caserios.  Today the city is a bustling, hot metropolis with immigrants from all over Peru.\r\n\r\nMaribel is a member of the Mujeres Emprendedoras (Women Entrepreneurs) bank.  She has worked with them and the Manuela Ramos microfinance organization for over four years now.

She is 52 years old and has 5 grown children who are all independent. Her husband is a chauffeur, but his salary does not meet all of their needs.  To help contribute, Nelly began selling bottled soft drinks. Then, with her first loan of 300 soles from Manuela Ramos she set up a bar. Today, she runs a business, just like she always dreamed of, getting up very early every day to open her bar and cheerfully attend to her patrons. In the afternoons, her husband joins her and they work together at the bar until 11pm every night. Now, Nelly would like a loan of 2000 soles so that she can buy 20 cases of beer, 10 cases of soft drinks, 5 cases of mineral water, some glasses, and sets of tables and chairs so she can refurbish the bar. Nelly is a hardworking, driven woman who, along with her husband, has a great desire to succeed in her endeavors. She is very happy and grateful for the great support she receives from Manuela Ramos. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":251798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beer, soda, water, glasses, and furniture for a bar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caller\u00eda - Ucayali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-01-08T17:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":339.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10225243,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":339.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20418026,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":339.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111478,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":339.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006665,"comment":null},{"amount":108.45,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":340.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590375,"comment":null},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":339.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984695,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-09T14:44:55Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:23:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82555,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena K. is 29 years old.

A typical working day for Graciana starts at 8 in the morning and ends at 6 in the evening, after all the cheese has been sold.  Graciana needs our help to raise capital for her business.  This will be her seventh loan with Micofinanzas Prisma.

One problem Magaly has is that she suffers from asthma, as does her daughter. \r\nFor seven years she has received loans which have helped her set up and reinvest in her business. Magaly now needs a loan of 600 soles which she will spend on computer maintenance and to buy better keyboards, speakers, etc. Magaly hopes to get another business and to buy herself a booth in the market. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Martyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":251886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"maintainence of computers for internet business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T16:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":156.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215405,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":156.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397114,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":156.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088789,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":156.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982145,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T18:23:05Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:00:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82586,"name":"Flor De Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor pertenece al Bancomunal Mujeres del Futuro.

She was unable to finish her studies because she got married. She is now 33 years old with four children ages 11, 7, 3, and the youngest just 5 months. The oldest children are attending school. \r\nFlor began working as a housecleaner, but later decided to focus on selling fruits in the market of Sevilla in her neighbourhood. She did so for over a year and a half but kept being deceived by providers who would give her boxes with ripe fruits on top, but rotten fruit beneath, which made her lose money. Since her children were so young she decided to leave this business and open a small shop in her home, which she and her mother have run for the past year and a half. She also continues to clean houses part time which gives her time to spend with her children. \r\nFlor de Maria is requesting a loan of 400 soles in order to invest in her shop, she will use it to buy clothing for resale.

The Triunfadoras (or \u201cThe Triumphant\u201d) formed as a communal bank less than one year ago.  Because they are a new group, their loan amounts are small, varying between three and eight hundred Nuevo Soles.  They meet monthly in one bank member\u2019s home on Pomorrosa Street in a suburb of Pucallpa, Peru.  The city is a bustling regional capital and major transportation hub of the Amazon River basin area in eastern Peru.  The construction of the highway fifty years ago, linking Pucallpa to Lima, marked the beginning of a new epoch for the booming capital.  No other city in the jungle is connected to the country\u2019s capital by a paved road; for this reason, all major shipping throughout the Amazon Basin to Lima passes through Pucallpa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe women of this communal bank all work in and around Pucallpa, operating small businesses from corner stores out of their homes to stalls in local markets.  The majority of the women in the \"Las Triunfadoras de Marko Jara\" bank sell some sort of product for a living.  The Triunfadoras are requesting loans of individual amounts, but they collectively guarantee the repayment of the entire bulk loan.  The bank members will be using the loan to fund a variety of endeavors including: sales of vegetables, shoes, candy, bananas, furniture, and bottled drinks.  Each woman will repay her portion of the bulk loan within the same four-month term.<P>\r\n\r\nThe bank members requesting a group loan are: Milena Liliana G. F. (s\/.500), Danitza Ivette M.

She's a farmer but she also raises livestock, something that she's done for 10 years.  It's work to which she's dedicated because thanks to the business, she's had the money to better feed and clothe her loved ones.  She also likes getting up very early and staying busy during the day because work for her is one of life's pleasures and makes her feel that she's doing something useful for her family.  Without a doubt, though, the thing that Nancy likes best is being with her family who provide the support necessary for her to keep striving.  What gratifies her most is seeing her animals get fatter so that she can ultimately sell them.  Nancy is just starting at MFP.  She's a hard-working woman, a sure guarantee that her loan will be repaid.

Zohirboy is always trying to provide high quality services but at the same time make the prices attractive for his customers. He is doing his best to make his business stable and profitable as he is the main bread-winner in his large family. <P>\r\n\r\nZohirboy is ready to work from the early morning till late at night in order to keep his customers and obtain new ones. Today he is planning to replace the car's fuel supply system with one using gas as a fuel, as this is cheaper than petrol. For this reason he is requesting US$ 800 for a term of 8 months. He thanks everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan in a timely manner. The well-being of this family is in your hands. <P> \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
