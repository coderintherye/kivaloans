She is married to Nepomuceno, a driver, and she is a mother to her three children. \r\n\r\nMarisa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the locals in the neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP-worth of cooking oil, or a single egg. Marisa earns her income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them individually. \r\n\r\nMarisa's store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community, and she earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, Marisa is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses and support her children\u2019s schooling. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 21,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarisa hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her family a good future.

Although she is a psychologist by profession, when she learned about this business, which she carries out through her mother-in-law in the city of Medell\u00edn, she became keen and started working with a lot of enthusiasm which she still hasn't lost.  She has grown and strengthened her business in the city of Barranquilla and has invested in marketing the business through leaflets, ads in newspapers and telephone directories, mobile ads, etc.  Most of her customers are households who need cleaning and upholstering services for their living room and dining room furniture, drapes and rugs.  Gisela has the help of one worker who handles the cleaning machine and leaves the furniture clean, unstained and dry the same day.  This is something her customers really like.  With her great business vision, Gisela has taken part in cleaning fairs organized by chain stores and large stores in the city.  She will invest her loan in buying supplies and hiring staff to collect from customers who pay 30 days after they have received this service.

He lives with his wife and their three children, of whom two are already economically independent. The house in which they now live is located in the district of Tambogrande, which belongs to the province of Piura, which is located about three hours from the city of Chiclayo. He lives in the rural part of this district, which is progressing a little, so for now, they only have basic electrical service.\n\nSegundo lives in an area that is thoroughly dedicated to agriculture and livestock raising, so he is not unfamiliar with these businesses, which are his principal economic activities. Segundo has 0.5 hectares of agricultural land, which is planted with lemons of good quality. As he tells us, this is an export product. He has been working in this business for approximately 6 years, because in the past he worked in the sale of animals, and in his desire to excel he decided to plant and look for better and larger markets for his products and thus be able to buy more hectares of agricultural land to improve his living conditions. His wife supports the family's basic needs with the sale of chicha de jora (a Peruvian corn-based beer), which generates a daily income, and also by the sale of farm-yard animals.\n\nHis own desire to excel every day for the well-being of his family, especially that of his children, has caused Segundo to apply to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan in the amount of 1000 PEN so that he can buy fertilizers which will serve to improve the quality of his products.\n\nBecause Segundo is a responsible father who is concerned for the good nourishment and above all the education of his children and at the same time for all his family, he has earned the recognition and respect of all his neighbors in the surrounding villages.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1002966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers to improve the quality of his plantings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-21T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-22T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":68.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":93.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":95.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":98.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T21:24:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394741,"name":"Hadijja","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadijja is a 28-year-old, hard-working lady with one child living in Kasese, Uganda.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 refrescos y bebidas, adem\u00e1s de insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus alimentos. Estas compras la realizar\u00e1 de contado y en mayor volumen,  lo cual disminuye el porcentaje de sus costos y es justamente lo que motiva el \u00e9xito de su inversi\u00f3n. ","en":"Hernando, who is 30 years old, is the proprietor of a restaurant in the center of the city, which he began as the result of a family tradition, since his parents worked in this business and he had to assume control because his father became sick. It has been his business for 12 years, and he has made many modifications in the infrastructure, because it has been growing. Also, to honor his father, he gave the restaurant the name that it carries today. In his business he works with his brother and an assistant in the production process, and they are his right hand. Hernando is very satisfied with this business, with which he has managed to raise his family, which consists of his wife and three children, ages 13, 4, and 6 months. Now the carnival season is approaching, and it brings with it a great increase in his sales, and his working capital becomes insufficient to respond to this demand and offer competitive prices. This is the reason why he has turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that he will receive from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which he will buy soft drinks and beverages, in addition to ingredients to prepare his foods. He will make these purchases for cash and in large volume, which will decrease a percentage of his costs and is precisely what motivates the success of his investment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1006637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy soft drinks and beverages, and ingredients to prepare food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-21T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-22T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80049},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84553},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86526},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88545},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90611},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92725},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94889},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":97103},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":99369},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":101687},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":104060},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":109883}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-29T16:03:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394814,"name":"Esterlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"47-year-old Esterlita is a married woman from Trinidad, Bohol.

He plans to achieve an income of 95,000 West African Francs per month, which he will use to repay the Soro Yiriwaso loan, cover family expenses and reinvest the rest  in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1010655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy smoked fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-21T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-22T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chaka  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-22T07:21:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395340,"name":"Jaynagul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0416\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043b 32 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0448\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439  \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438,   \u0416\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0432 2000 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 10 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446. \u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c, \u0416\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 2 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0434\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, 10 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 \u0438 2 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430;

They live in Huancuni community, toward the north of Colomi, in the city of Cochabamba, on the shores of the lake.  They have lived there for 18 years.\r\n\r\nGregorio and his partner are farmers.  They grow potatoes, beans, 'oca' and 'papalisa' (native tubers).  They grow some of their crops on 4 hectares of farmland that they inherited from their parents in their own community and some on a 1 hectare plot of land that they own in Paracti community.  They also own 3 dairy cows, 1 cow which is raised for meat and 2 calves.  Gregorio and his partner built a new house in which they invested all of their savings.  They now need money to buy organic fertilizer (manure from laying hens) so that they can make the most of the low price at this time of year.  They also need to buy chemical products.  For this reason, they came to Cidre to request a loan.\r\n\r\nGregorio and his family tell us that they are very happy to have this opportunity.

Specifically, she makes weavings with a power loom in a workshop that she has set up in the dining room of her house. \r\n\r\nShe says she began in this field when she worked for a company selling wool. Later they sent her for training where she did a course in weaving. In this way she learned the trade. Over time she realized that she liked handicrafts and she bought her first power loom so that she could work independently. Currently she makes woven pieces with different designs, as she weaves a lot. Additionally, she has two big customers who buy her handicrafts at wholesale and then resell them at retail. One of these customers is an exclusive clothing store in the city of Vi\u00f1a del Mar. She also makes pants, vests, t-shirts, and other innovative designs in women's clothing. She buys her merchandise, essentially \"wool\", in La Ligua (an area known for its artisanal textiles). One of her goals is to add-on to her house so that she can install her workshop in another area of the house. With this loan she will buy wholesale wool. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Luisa mentions that she has been separated for three years. Right now she lives with her two children who are 16 and 10 years old. Her personal dreams are to give her children a better quality education. She is very happy and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her as it allows her to invest in her business. She says that the communal bank group that she is a part of is very responsible and committed. With respect to the trainings, they have helped her to better organize her business accounting.\r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 kilometers north-west of Santiago.

Elena, a hamlet in the district of Tambogrande located a few hours from the province of Piura. In the village where Elmer lives, the main activity is farming and cattle breeding, which has always provided for the needs of every household.\r\n\r\nElmer has been busy with livestock since he was a young boy, breeding mostly cattle, sheep and poultry.  He allotted part of his house to breeding and feeding his animals and selling them to his customers. In addition to selling cattle, he also grows lemons in his own field, which he harvests every week. He receives the unconditional support of his wife and his children, who participate in all the activities.\r\n\r\nElmer is an unbanked customer. He came to the microfinance institution Edpyme Alternativa and applied for his first loan to progressively expand his business and offer a better quality of life to his family. The loan amounts to 1000 new soles and will be used to buy balanced feed for his livestock and fertilizer for his lemon plantation.\r\n\r\nElmer and his family have a good reputation with their neighbors, both as people and as workers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1007311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy balanced feed and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-21T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-22T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":70.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":70.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":92.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":96.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":98.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.03},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T14:22:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393092,"name":"Arthur","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio se sigue dedicando al trabajo como docente del nivel secundario y tambien tiene un academia de preparacion para la universidad,el socio trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m,por medio de este trabajo el socio saca adelante a sus hijos,el sue\u00f1o del socio es ampliar y mejorar el negocio de academia.

He and his wife Manzura were engaged in the same business, but as Manzura is raising their small child, she is not currently working. For almost 15 years Faizullo has been making kebabs (a traditional meat dish) and selling them ready-to-eat near the entrance to the local hospital, where he has his diner-like spot. It's a crowded place with many visitors, and Faizullo sells over 150 kebabs daily, while also serving fish and beer. \r\n\r\nFaizullo first came to MDO Arvand, LLC six years ago, and since then has been taking loans continuously to expand his business. Every day Faizullo purchases raw ingredients at the market using his car.
