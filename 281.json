Romela is now 34 years old and lives in the village of Purok Camansi, Brgy. Mailum, Bago City, Negros Occidental with her husband who works as a security guard, and their three children.  The oldest is now 17 years old and is studying aeronautics, the second is 16 years old, and is in the fourth year of high school, and the youngest is 11 and is still in elementary school.\r\n\r\nWhen Romela married and got pregnant while still a teenager, her parents were disappointed because they thought all their dreams and aspirations for her would come to naught.  They were worried about how she would survive in the future. Acquaintances and relatives thought that she was throwing her life away. She proved all of them wrong by sheer will, determination and tirelessly working hard along with her husband to make a life for their young family.\r\n\r\nWhile she was pregnant with her first child, her parents decided to close their business of buying and selling firewood and bamboo poles. Seeing an opportunity to help her husband by earning her own living, Romela decided to take over the business operations that her parents were closing up. With only the small amount of capital that her husband could provide, she was able to continue dealing with the same suppliers.  She earned the loyalty of the same customers because they did not have to go somewhere else. By planning her cash flow well, she was able to maintain the business and slowly make it into a stable source of income.\r\n\r\nAfter several years, Romela saw that she needed to earn more if she was to provide her children with a better future. Her problem was where to find the necessary additional capital so that she could expand her business. When someone told her about NWTF-Project Dungganon, she immediately asked her husband's permission to join so that she could access the much-needed additional capital to increase her stocks of firewood and bamboo poles through loans that she could pay in weekly installments. \r\n\r\nHer business grew and she was able to increase her income, allowing her to afford her children's education and save for their future. She used her 3rd cycle loan to purchase a tricycle - a motorcycle with a side car - which she uses in her business, allowing her to make deliveries of the firewood and bamboo poles to her regular customers, increasing her income potential even further.\r\n\r\nIn the five years since she became an NWTF-Project Dungganon member, her business continues to improve and it earns approximately $225 a month for her family. Her previous loan - the 19th cycle loan amounting Php 10,000 - was used as additional capital for the business and it was fully paid on time without any delays.  For her 20th cycle loan she proposes to get the same amount of Php 10,000 as additional capital for her business. Her future plan is to expand her business and put up a general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

B. lives in the village of Sitio Coop, Brgy. Anahaw, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She is 35 years old and married to Eulogio B., who is presently employed as Kabo (supervisor) in a sugarcane plantation. They have an adopted child, Jasmine, who is eight years old. The couple is still hoping to have their own baby someday. Even though she has a small family, Vivian still prepares for their future. She still helps her husband raise their weekly income. \r\n\r\nThe family has their own small rice farm that supports the food needs of the family. This gave Vivian the idea to make the rice field more productive. In the year 2002 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have capital for her farm to buy seeds and fertilizer and to pay for labor. Since the rice is harvested after three months, Vivian worked in the sugarcane plantation in the meantime. After harvesting the rice, she had it milled and sold it to the people in her community and also to the sugarcane workers. The rice business earns an average of PHP 4,000 per month, which is enough for her small family, with savings left for their future security.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 17,000 was used as working capital for her farm. She paid all of her weekly installments on time and the loan was fully paid within the loan term, maintaining her status as a good member of NWTF_Project Dungganon. Now she is borrowing Php 19,000 to add to her capital for her rice farm to have a better living standard in the future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

she is 67 years old, Delivina T. still wants to continue to be independent and self-sufficient. She is married to Basilio, who is 69 years old and retired. They have nine grown children - all of whom have their own families. Delivina and Basilio live in the town of Moises Padilla in the province of Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nDelivina owns a food vending business that sells \"Inasal\" - charcoal grilled barbecued meats like hotdogs, pork strips, beef tocino, and even solidified pork blood, which is a popular native delicacy. Her food stand is quite popular in her neighborhood and has enabled her to save enough to establish a general store adjacent to her house. She also makes and sells banana cue. Banana cue is made of fried bananas on skewers that are coated with sugar and cooked until the sugar caramelizes.\r\n\r\nThe income her business generates helps her cover household expenses. Over the years, she has been able to pay to build her house and to create a savings for future security. Although she's been in this business for over 20 years now, she still enjoys managing the daily activities. She now earns about PHP 9,000 per month. Her last loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon was her 19th one and she borrowed PHP 19,500, which she used as additional capital for her business. This time around, she intends to borrow PHP 22,000 for her 20th cycle to reinvest further into her food vending business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She lives in the Memorial Sandino neighborhood in the capital of Managua. She has two children, aged 6 and 9, who study for better lives and wellbeing. Her business is in the sales of milk products, sodas, candies and cosmetics like a small general store. She started this business with money that her husband gave her and with financing from Afodenic. This is her tenth cycle, and she has been able to invest in her business to supply it and increase her sales. Her husband has two trucks from which he sells sand, gravel and quarry rock and makes trips to obtain them, so everything is profit. Araceli will invest this loan in the purchase of basic grains and cosmetic goods to offer her customers a variety of products, which she hopes will increase her sales and outcome. Her plan is to continue constructing her house to give a decent home to her family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":395293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase basic grains, milk products,  cosmetics and others to increase her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:01:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracely Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1636.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713909,"comment":null},{"amount":170.33,"local_amount":3503.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3504.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601599,"comment":null},{"amount":81.64,"local_amount":1679.44,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1679.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003049,"comment":null},{"amount":1.01,"local_amount":20.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:15Z","rounded_local_amount":20.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841202,"comment":null},{"amount":172.97,"local_amount":3558.16,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3558.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874114,"comment":null},{"amount":86.69,"local_amount":1783.43,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1783.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639496,"comment":null},{"amount":90.06,"local_amount":1852.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1852.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821266,"comment":null},{"amount":192.75,"local_amount":3965.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3965.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561299,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-25T13:21:37Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140249,"name":"Unidas Por Fe Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo solidario Unidas Por Fe, es originario de la comarca Valle de la laguna, ubicada en zonas cercanas a la laguna de apoyo.

Trabaja con la ayuda de sus tres hijos de 18, 17 y 14 a\u00f1os y aun que alega que en este negocio se tienen altibajos por las bajas o alzas en los precios, ha podido superarse en gran manera y mejorar las condiciones de su familia.\n\nEste cr\u00e9dito lo invertir\u00e1 en la siembra de Sandia, es su noveno ciclo y posee un record crediticio muy bueno del cual se siente muy orgulloso.\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":395311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de prductos para sembrar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-09-26T18:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12343.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144637813,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-28T02:08:06Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:29:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140257,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase supplies for painting his taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-09-26T19:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1695.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97018718,"comment":null},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1695.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863375,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-30T22:43:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":140258,"name":"Mis Jardines Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nEl grupo Mis Jardines esta integrado Mar\u00eda Isabel S.

T. is a 52-year-old widow from the village of Punta Tagda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental, with five children. As a single parent, she must act as both mother and father to them even if they have all reached the age of majority. One of her children already has a family, while the remaining four are still single. Three of her single children are gainfully employed; the youngest, who is 21, is still in school.\r\n\r\nRamonita is glad that she has her own business because she was not left penniless when her husband died. She continued to earn an income that was able to support her family's needs. Ramonita started her general store 11 years ago and it has provided her with enough income to pay for her family's expenses and her children's tuition fees. She has always relied on the loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to provide her with the necessary revolving working capital that allowed her to continuously stock her store with the necessary volume of inventory.  It currently earns her an average monthly income of 6,000 Philippine pesos.  \r\n\r\nHer last loan of PHP 13,000, her 11th from NWTF-Project Dungganon, was used to buy stock for her general store. As was her usual practice, she paid each weekly installment on time and was able to fully repay the loan within the loan term, as she promised. Now for her 12th loan cycle, she is proposing to borrow PHP 15,000 to be used again as working capital in her general store so that she can continue earning enough to support her family. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":392127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married to Eduardo M., who worked as a laborer in a sugarcane plantation. They have eight children: six of them already have their own families and only two still live at home. The family lives in the village of Brgy. San Juan, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore she went into business, Erlinda also worked in the sugarcane plantation with her husband so that they could earn enough to feed their family of ten. But working in the sugarcane fields is very hard work, with long hours for very low wages and few benefits, and it took her away from home leaving her children to fend for themselves. Watching her children grow, Erlinda thought about their future and realized that if the family did not earn more income, she and her husband could never afford to send the children to school and provide them with a better future. This is why she decided to put up a small general store next to her house, using some of her salary from the sugarcane plantation. However, because her capital was very limited, she could only sell a few products. \r\n<p>\r\nTo access more capital, Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, and she immediately saw the impact of the additional 3,000 pesos she received from her first loan. She was able to buy more goods to sell and she noticed that the inventory turnover was faster, and she was able to earn more profits. So, as her income improved and NWTF-Project Dungganon allowed her to borrow larger amounts based on the cash flow estimates she presented in her proposal, she was able to expand her general store. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of 15,000 pesos was her twelfth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She was able to pay off each weekly installment on time, and fully repaid the loan within the loan term. It earned her an average monthly income of 3,000 pesos. For her thirteenth loan cycle, she is asking to borrow another 15,000 pesos to use as working capital for her general store so that she can continue improving the life of her family.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":391095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. lives in an island village in the beautiful town of Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines. She is determined and optimistic about getting out from the cycle of poverty. She is married to Andres who is 33 and a ferry (small passenger boat in the island) driver. She is the mother to an only daughter, Andrea, who is two years old.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnita is engaged in the resale of 'kaing' (big fruit baskets) and charcoal. She has been doing the resale business since she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2007. She buys charcoal and 'kaing' from the makers and re-sells it.  She says, the business brings her in enough income to augment their standard of living and to sustain their daily needs. She wants to invest more in the business.<P>\r\n\r\nNow on her 4th loan, she proposes to borrow 20,000 PHP as additional capital for her business. Specifically, the loan will fund the purchase of ready-made 'kaing', 50 sacks of charcoal, and payment for labor and transportation expenses. Anita has regular customers already and charcoal is easy to sell because it is commonly used by households in the cooking of foods.<P>\r\n\r\nAnita is optimistic that her business will grow and can help her reach her dreams. She aspires to expand her business for greater income. She also dreams of sending her child to school until she finishes college and finds job. She also hopes to be able to build her own house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":395516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"for the

A. is 45 years old and married to Virgilio, a ferry (small passenger boat) driver, who is 48 years old. She is a mother to three, two sons and a daughter. All of her kids are in school and they are very studious. She lives in the island village in the town of Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Norma joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with hopes of getting access to capital to fund her business. For more than eight years she has been engaged in the resale of frozen foods as her primary business and fishing as her secondary business. Recently she decided to make fishing her primary business. She believes that fishing, as compared to the resale of frozen foods, brings her much more income for sustaining the needs of her family, especially with all of her kids attending school.\r\n<p>\r\nNow on her fourth loan, she is requesting 20,000 PHP as additional capital for her fishing business. Part of the loan money will still go to her resale of frozen foods. Specifically, some of the amount will be used to pay for two bundles of fishnets for her fish cage and some will be used as rolling capital for her frozen foods business.\r\n<p>\r\nNorma is positive that her business will succeed with the help of ASHI and with the trust of KIVA lenders. She dreams of supporting her children in their schooling until they finish college and find jobs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":395521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fishnets for

D. is a woman from the island village in the town of Binangonan in Rizal province in the Philippines. She is married to Librado, who is 50 years old and the driver of a small passenger ferry. She is a mother to three: two sons and a daughter.\r\n\r\nShe has faith that she will get out of poverty. In 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with a bagful of hope of gaining access to capital. Her previous loans were carefully invested in a hog-raising business (pigs). The business runs smoothly, and it brings them good profit during times when the pigs are sold in the market. But it takes more than three months before the pigs will be ready to sell.\r\n\r\nJust recently, she decided to shift her business to a more productive business: fishing. She believes that a fishing business would bring her enough profit with less time and effort. Now that she is about to receive her third loan in the amount of 15,000 PHP, she plans to buy 30 pieces of bamboo, thousands of fingerlings and fry, and bundles of fishnet, as well as to pay labor expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that, with the help of ASHI and with the trust of KIVA lenders, little by little, she can reach her dreams in life. She aspires to expand her business and be able to save for the future of her children, especially their school needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":395543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for 30 pieces

He is an enthusiastic and industrious man, and therefore always encouraging his family to preserve to achieve their goals. He lives in his own house with his wife and his three small children. He has worked as a carpenter for ten years. In the beginning he had many problems installing his workshop and had to work in diverse business to obtain sufficient money to buy his machinery. With time he managed to install a workshop inside their house and is now the most recognized carpenter in the region, because his works are of the highest quality. What pleases Juan most about his work is varnishing the furniture, which causes the furniture to obtain a special beauty. On the other hand, he considers the most difficult part of his work making large furniture for rooms because they have to be finished perfectly, however large furniture is also very profitable because the cost of production is increased for the time invested. In the future, Juan desires to expand its workshop and to acquire new machinery that will permit him to expedite his work. This is his first credit with Microfinanzas PRISM, an affiliate of Kiva, and he intends to work responsibly and comply with his payments.

For their living, her husband is a caretaker of a farm with a monthly wage of 5,000 Php and some allowances. But this amount is not sufficient to meet their needs and this is the reason why Mrs. F. decided to engage in different businesses. At present, she has a little sari-sari store inside her house. She is also a member of JTY, a direct selling company for RTW\u2019s and also a retailing activity for dried fish.

AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and she would use the rest of money to buy piglet for breeding. Her husband, Mr. Men Rorn, is a hard working man who has been hired by the other villager to work on the filed.

She lives in the island village in the town of Binangonan, in Rizal province in the Philippines. She believes that to get out of the cycle of poverty, people should exert effort in looking for sustainable ways of living.\r\n\r\nWith her desire to overcome poverty, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2009, with a bagful of hope of gaining access to capital for her dying business. When she received her first loan, she carefully invested it as additional capital in her fishing business. She has fish cages where small fish are cultured until they are ready to harvest.\r\n\r\nNow on her 2nd loan, she wants to invest more in the fishing business. She is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP to pay for fish nets, ropes, bamboo, and labor in making fish cages. She is positive that her business will grow and could bring her enough income to save for her children's future. She dreams of having a more spacious and more durable house to live in, and also to send her children to school until they finish college and find jobs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":395801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for fish nets,

V. was born in 1969 and is a married woman. She currently lives in Siem Reap Province. She has four children, four of whom are employed and earn money to help meet with family's living expenses.

G. is from the village of Lao Proper. She is 47 years old. Norma is married and has an adult-aged child. To make a living, Norma owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Norma has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000, Norma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Norma has successfully repaid her most recent loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC.

Susette has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Susette joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Susette has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Susette is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Susette from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Elsime has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Elsime joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsime has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. Elsime is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

I. is from the village of Panta-on Ozamiz City.

The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting cassava for sale. Vizminda has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Vizminda joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vizminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. She is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and save for future needs. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

P., age 37, is from the village of Mambajao in Camiguin Province. Brigida and her husband have four school-aged children. To make a living, Brigida owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks like banana and hot cakes in the local community. Brigida has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Brigida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. Her aim was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Brigida is requesting a loan in the amount of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Brigida from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

P., age 42, is from the village of  Guinsiliban in Camiguin Province. Nenita is married and has four grown children. To make a living, Nenita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Nenita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Nenita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items in order to expand her store's product offerings. Nenita is requesting a loan in the amount of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nenita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is from the village of Cabunga-an Clarin. She is 32 years old. Elsie is married with 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Elsie owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not her only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Elsie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Elsie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation as well as her ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Elsie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and save for future use. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a mother to eight: seven sons and an only daughter. She is a woman with clear foresight of the future of her family.\r\n\r\nIt is more than a decade already that Marites has been running the fishing business but, due to insufficient capital, sometimes she encounters problems regarding her business needs. In 2009, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with hopes of getting access to capital for her dying business. When she received her first loan, she invested it in her fishing business. It was successful and the business now brings her a good income to sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nMarites has a fish cage where she cultures small fish until they are ready to harvest and sell in the market. She has regular customers already and sometimes she roams around the village and even in the market to sell fish.\r\n\r\nNow on her 2nd loan, she proposes a loan of 10,000 PHP as additional capital for her fishing business. The amount will be used to pay for a bundle of fishnet, fifty pieces of bamboo and payment for the labor of making the fish cage. She hopes to expand her business and be able to save for the future of her children, especially their school

C. is a woman who is full of determination and faith, with the goal of bringing her family out of the spiral of poverty that hinders their way to success. She is a young, 24 year old mother to her daughter and is happily living with her husband Bernard, who is her partner in the business. She lives on an island village in the town of Binangonan, Rizal Province in the Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a newly married woman, life was not easy for Erma. She needs to think of the future of her child. She is already running a General Store but it has not been as productive as expected. She needs to venture into another business, but has no capital to use. Therefore, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in the hopes of getting access to capital for her business.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she received her previous loan, she carefully utilized it as capital for her fishing business. It is her husband who goes fishing using fish nets. The fish he catches is sold in the village and even in the market. Their supply of fish to sell in the town is great and earns her a good income. She wants to improve her business and wants to invest more in it.\r\n<p>\r\nFor this, her next loan, she is requesting an amount of 10,000 PHP to buy bundles of fishnets and other fishing gear. She is hopeful that with the support of ASHI and with the trust of KIVA lenders, she can expand her business and be able to attain her dreams slowly and methodically. She also aspires to save for the future of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":396128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

Providing her family with financial security, raising their standard of living and ultimately moving them out of poverty is what motivates Elena T. to work hard with her husband to earn a good living for their family.\r\n\r\nElena is 37 years old, married to Gadiel T. and, with their three children, live in the village of Sitio Anahaw, Barangay Miranda, Hinigaran City, Negros Occidental. The couple work cooperatively in their salted-egg business. He buys the eggs and makes the salted eggs and she sells them.\r\n\r\nBecause of her earnestness to lift her family out of poverty and to achieve her dreams, Elena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 so that she could access capital to start a business that could support her family. She went through the required seminars and, when she got her loan, she opened a general store adjacent to her house.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Elena built a good credit record and was able to borrow bigger amounts because she proved that her cash flow was able to afford the weekly installments. The bigger loans gave her the opportunity to diversify into another business venture, so she and her husband decided to invest in a salted-egg business; he made them and she sold them in her general store and distributed to other outlets in the community and neighboring towns. Elena also went into food-vending which she sold in her general store.\r\n\r\nFrom her different business activities, Elena earns an average profit of PHP 15,000 per month which she uses to pay for their household expenses and the education of her children; the balance she puts back as additional capital for her different ventures.\r\n\r\nElena\u2019s previous loan of Php 19,500 was used as additional capital for her business and it was fully paid on time. For her 9th loan she proposes to borrow the same amount - Php 19,500 to boost her salted-egg production.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

into business on your own is sometimes tough it but can also provide a good living if you are patient, determined, and stay focused on the finish line, which is the achievement of your dream. This is what Margionila D. believes and has experienced as a micro-entrepreneur. She is now 58 years old and married with five children who are between the age of 9 and 33. The family lives in the village of Purok Flower, Barangay Cervants, Escalante City, Negros Occidental.\n\nBecause of her ambition to provide a good future for her five children, Margionila put up a general store to help her husband support their family. At first she only sold basic household commodities because of the fast turnover of these products. For several years, she continued to just rotate her capital, putting most of the profits back into the business after using just a small portion for the education of her children. But later, she knew she needed to expand her business to earn more because her family's needs was also growing.\n\nThis is the reason why Margionila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon: so that she could have additional capital; so that she could earn more and afford to send her children to college. In spite of the ups and downs in her business, she was relentless in her struggle to sustain her children's education and, when the older kids graduated and started earning their own living, she was able to breathe more freely, but she did not stop working.\n\nWith the help of her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Margionila was able to buy a motorized fishing boat which earns additional income for her. The daily catch, whether it is fish or crabs, is usually sold in the local market or bought by her regular customers.\n\nThe previous loan of PHP 19,500 that Margionila borrowed was used for her fishing business. She was able to pay it off on time without any delays in the weekly installments. This time, she is only borrowing PHP 6,000 for her 13th loan because she only needs this much additional capital for her general store, as she anticipates that because it is going to be off-season for the sugar industry in the coming months.\n\nMargiolina is shown in the picture posing in her motorized fishing boat.\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":399183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

G. is a 31-year-old single parent living in Barangay Talab-an, a part of Manapla Municipality in Negros Occidental Province. She is not married because her fianc\u00e9 became sick and died before their wedding, leaving her pregnant with their baby. Even though she must support her five-year-old daughter alone, she is determined to provide a good future for her child. \r\n<p>\r\nLeft alone to fend for her baby girl, Gena decided to establish her own business with the help of start-up capital from her mother so that she could support her young daughter and herself. As she moved on with her life, the pain of losing her child's father lessened, especially as she busied herself with building her general store and raising her daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her business slowly grew, Gena saw new opportunities for expansion. In 2006 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could add to her capital and expand her business. The loans she received from NWTF-Project Dungganon enabled her to diversify into food vending, including selling frozen food in her general store. The business now earns an average monthly income of 10,000 PHP, which she uses for household expenses and in savings for her daughter's future. The rest she plows back into the business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her eighth loan cycle she borrowed 19,500 PHP to add to her revolving working capital. She was able to pay back the weekly installments on time and in full within the loan term. Now Gena is requesting a loan of 21,000 PHP for her ninth cycle. With it she intends to increase her inventory a little more so that she can build her savings for the future security of her small family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through its alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a dollar a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live lives that they can finally call honorable ones.

2006, Heidi and her husband decided that they were tired of working for other people and wanted to earn money on their own. Once they found a coffee shop for sale on the internet, they knew buying it was the perfect chance to take. Over the last three years, they have invested significant amounts of time and money into renovating the cafe, even cashing in their 401k. Many of the cafe's customers  had left when the cafe became run-down, before Heidi and her husband bought it. Their hard work has paid off - they have been able to get back many old customers, who remark how positive the new management has been for the business. \n\nThey will use this ACCION USA loan to help remodel their kitchen so that they can add new equipment, like a deep fryer and a basic stove, to add more food items like soups, sandwiches, and french fries to their menu. With these new items, they think they can increase their profit margin.\n\nIn the past, Heidi has used credit cards as a cash cushion\/emergency fund when unforeseen expenses come up, but she says that interest rates are so high nowadays that the convenience is not worth the price. She is thankful that she was able to receive the ACCION USA loan so that she will not have to pay so much interest. \n\nIn the future, Heidi plans to grow the coffee by opening up in more locations and possibly roasting her own coffee beans. She looks forward to the day when she can hopefully pass the business down to her children!
