She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or approximately US$194 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Petimara joined SPBD and this is her first loan with them. SPBD's loans are her only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":600083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

T. is from the village of Bato. She is 53 years old. Erlinda is married and has 1 adult-aged child. To make a living, Erlinda owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Erlinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Erlinda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. is twenty five years old, is single, and doesn\u2019t have any children yet. His business is located in a busy commercial area in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is in the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian Ocean\u2019s white beaches.\r\n\r\nGeorge has been selling clothes and cosmetics for the last three years to the local people. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is the recent diversion of the ferry, robbing him of so many customers who used to pass near his business and hence buy his items.

Primary school is staffed with ten teachers and  has185 pupils. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nJoseph S. K. (pictured here) is the head teacher and leader of this group. The 52-year-old Joseph was born in Binkolo village, about six miles from Makeni. He has been in the teaching profession for sixteen years now. He is married to a teacher and the couple has seven children \u2013 two in primary school and five in secondary school. \r\n\r\nMr. K. backs up his teaching income with agriculture. He has been an agriculturist for seven years now.  He will use part of his loan to pay school fees for his children and invest the rest in agriculture.

M. is a married woman who lives in Tutay, Pinamungajan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  hog raising and  kitchenware businesses. Her husband, Fabiano M., who is 48 years old, works as a kitchenware salesman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's other business activities.  They have six children who are 11  to  23 years old. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her hog raising and kitchenware businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future for family and education. Teresita M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is a 52-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures:   furniture-making, farming, and hog raising businesses. She lives in Tuod, Brgy.Isio, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\n By working hard in her   three  businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 20,000 PHP. Josette is now borrowing  15,000 PHP so that she  can purchase  materials for her furniture-making business.  This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nJosette aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

C. (pictured at her vegetable vending business) is a married woman who has seven children between the ages of 12 to 32 years old. Her husband, Romeo, is 60 years old and a farmer. The family lives in Purok Paraiso within Barangay Taloc, Bago City, in the province of Negros Occidental on the Western Visayas islands. Marietta has three businesses: selling vegetables, running a general store and farming. Romeo also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n<p>\r\nMarietta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marietta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 15,000 PHP, so lifting the family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her sixth loan cycle, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy fertilizer for her farm and buy some pigs to raise so that she can continue to save up to educate her children and lift their living conditions. Marietta C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attractions, including the Indian Ocean\u2019s white sand beaches. \r\n<p>\r\nFrancis has been selling mobile accessories for the last five years to local people. He says that this business is profitable, but the major challenge he faces is that in his area there are so many people doing the same kind of business as he is. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He describes himself as customer-friendly.\r\n<p>\r\nFrancis is requesting a loan of 50,000 KES to buy more phone accessories to expand his business. He hopes to grow and be able to improve his family's living standards. He also hopes to give his children a quality education and own a house some day.

E. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Canonoy, Brgy. Miranda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a coffee shop, a general store and a food-vending business. Her husband Jomarie, who is 44 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 2 to 13 years old. \r\n\r\nElena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock to sell in her coffee shop and food-vending businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and save up for future emergencies. Elena E. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

This time, for her thirteenth loan cycle, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more dried fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a pig fattening business and a farming business. Her husband, Rudy A., who is 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have one child who is 21 years old.\r\n\r\nFely joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, Fely is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to purchase more merchandise to sell in her general store. This will enable her to continue to save to sustainably expand her business while supporting her family.\r\n\r\nFely is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

They have seven children who range in age from 7 months to 22 years old. Four of the children already work to help her support their family and one is still going to school. \r\n\r\nMarilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use as revolving working capital for her food-vending business so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family and for the education of her child who is still going to school. Marilyn A. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

They live in the beautiful Ayacuchana jungle, in the village of Triboline, where they own their own home.<br>\r\nSaragoza\u2019s passion lies in the fields and she likes being in touch with nature. This is why she already has 26 years of farming experience, producing and selling cacao and various fruits. She has focused on diversifying her products, with much success. She is well aware that each product has its seasons, which is why she does not suffer monthly losses, but makes considerable profits in the valley.<br>\r\nShe usually works with her husband, and together they make a good team, but at harvest time they hire labourers to help pick the crops. She usually sells cacao at the local collection centres, but she sells the fruit in Ayacucho.

For that reason, she has approached Edpyme Alternative for the first time for a loan of 1,000 new sols.\r\n\r\nMaria is a very enterprising and hard-working woman, whose greatest hope is to continue growing as a business person, in order to offer her family a better quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":600473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"BUYING PRODUCTS OF PRIMARY NECESSITY AND GROCERIES TO EXPAND HER STORE IN HER HOUSE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oyot\u00fan -

She has been doing this for 30 and considers the most difficult part of tending to her crops are the pests that can disturb them. In the future, she hopes to be able to enlarge her land to be able to plant more. This is her ninth loan with   MFP. She affirms that she has always made her payments on time and she will this time as well. In her communal bank she is a member who is very committed to the group's development. With the five hundred nuevos soles that she is asking for, she will buy more pea seed, and in addition she will buy fertilizer.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":600613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pea seed and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886649,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-01T14:15:05Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":231309,"name":"Sirly Johana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sirly de 24 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona urbana \u201cLas Orqu\u00eddeas\u201d llamado as\u00ed porque en su descubrimiento hab\u00edan muchas flores orqu\u00eddeas.

He has always been a very responsible father and worker. He has worked in the restaurant sector for a long time and his work has gotten the public's attention as he has always been attentive in learning how to prepare the different dishes that the restaurants offer. His goal has always been to have his own food business even though his family has discouraged him many times to not follow through with this project. He left his job and made his dream a reality by buying some equipment to start his business. He works in his home and every day brings him business. He has had much success with selling hamburgers, chicken wings, etc. What differentiates him from his competitors is the quality of his products and the good service he provides to his customers. What he hopes to accomplish later on is finishing the construction on his house and putting  in a soda fountain. His loan will be used to buy products such as oil by the gallon, hamburgers, hot dogs, etc. He hopes to save and increase his profits.

From the time she was very young, Mercedes learned to work with the land, since farming has been in her family for many years.  She learned how from her parents and now she has her own plantings where she grows potatoes, corn and beans that she sells at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  What she likes most about her work is planting the fields since this will produce sales within 6 months.  She has been doing this work for 11 years and what she finds the most difficult is the infestation of insects that can hurt her production.

Her shop was robbed and looted. \r\n\r\nHowever, Dinara isn't giving up and is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this very reason, Dinara is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase more women\u2019s clothes to resell at the local market.

She is 50, married, and has three sons. Her husband earns his livelihood by working as a herdsman. Her younger sons help to earn money by working in the fields. This family of farmers cultivates rice and tobacco plants in an area of 3.35 hectares. This business has supported the family for sixteen years. At first it was an area of 1.7 hectares but after a number of years it was enlarged. Having gotten a profit out of this business, they have managed to obtain a car and some cattle. The purpose of this loan is to buy onion seeds to plant. Ominahon is planning to arrange her sons\u2019 weddings and to build a new house for their future families.\r\n\r\nBahrinsa E. is 39 years old and married. She is the treasurer of the group. Her spouse is an agriculturist. The couple has three children who help their parents to run the business. Sixteen years ago they used to cultivate wheat, but now the family grows rice and tobacco plants. In order to get a good harvest, lands should be carefully worked. That\u2019s why Bahrinsa needs a loan. In the future she wants to build a new house for her son.\r\n\r\nBaktybek K. is 29 years old and a bachelor. He is a farmer, and together with his father and sisters they run their farming business. Now they are cultivating an area of 2.7 hectares. Earnings have allowed him to make house repairs. Baktybek\u2019s aim for getting a loan is to buy a ton of rice for future planting. He is planning to marry in the near future. \r\n\r\nKumura P. is 45 years old and married. She and her husband, whose profession is farming, have two grown up children. Her son is an agriculturist. The family business is based on farming. They grow rice on a five hectare area and cucumbers on an area of 0.25 hectares. They have managed to obtain a tractor and some cattle. In order to lighten the work while harvesting, the family needs to obtain a mini-combine. For this reason they need a loan. In the future, Kumura wants to increase their stock of cattle, arrange her son\u2019s wedding and build him a house.    \r\n\r\n    --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

","en":"Eid, 56 years old, lives with his wife in the Aliaa neighborhood. Eid has been working in fishing since 1990. After 20 years of experience working on the sea has become an integrA. part of his life; fishing is his favourite and only hobby. Eid has requested a first-time loan to buy new equipment for his work, such as fishnets and other tools. Eid is an active wholesale fishmonger and his clients are retail fishmongers. He occasionally sells retail to his neighbours and relatives. One of the key problems that he faced during his business startup was a lack of experience. Although business was hard at first, he later started to excel. His love for fishing and, more specifically, for the sea were among the main reasons for developing his business. Eid seeks to develop his business and to buy bigger fishing boats in the near future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Arabic by Rania ElMaraghy, Kiva

B. is from the city of Macupa Tangub City.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products such as soap, sardines, shampoo, cooking oil, vinegar, and more in the local community. Josefina has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Josefina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josefina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Josefina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is from  Prenza, Tangub City. She is 29 years old. Antonia is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Antonia owns & operates transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating motorcycle transport services. Antonia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Antonia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Antonia is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the first loan taken out by Antonia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":600920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to repair existing vehicle for better service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tangub City, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-09-18T15:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5544.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201293215,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-18T16:00:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:11:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
