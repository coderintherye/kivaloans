Marivie P., 28, does just that. Marivie is only a high school graduate but right now she manages her own micro-business as she learns entrepreneurship as a community partner in CCT*. She is married to Joenard,  who is a driver, and mothers her three children, who are now in elementary school.\r\n\r\nFor six years now, Marivie has been in the coconut business. She buys young coconut fruit directly from farmers and she retails them. She has a fruit stand along the highway by-pass leading to Tagaytay City, a local tourist destination in the province. Marivie also sells coconut by-products like pure coco vinegar and coco wine. She earns an estimated net monthly income of around 12,000 PHP from this business.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan.  She intends to use this loan to purchase more fresh young coconuts for selling.\r\n\r\nMarivie acknowledges that no challenges are too hard to deal with. She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome and uphold the future of both her children and her business. She dreams of making her sari-sari store grow.

By the grace of God, Marivic has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college.

What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sells items piecemeal with a small profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other items. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options that are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMarivic dreams to be able to give her all her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.

is Susan P., 49, a resident of Ascoville, Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Jose P., an overseas Filipino worker. She is the mother of five children, one of whom is already working while another is currently enrolled in college; one is in high school and two are enrolled in the local elementary school. \r\n\r\nBy the grace of God, Susan has managed to support her older children's schooling up to the college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her remaining children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Susan, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSusan operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP\u2019s-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan is requesting a 17,000 PHP loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Susan dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan prays for successful lives for all her children and hopefully they will able to send her children all the way through college.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

He and his family live in Olmos District, a busy commercial and agricultural area located in Lambayeque province, an hour and a half from the town of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the last two years Manuel has raised and sold livestock. He raises the calves in corrals located at the back of his house. When the young animals have reached an optimal stage of development, he sells them in the local market. He wishes to increase his herd by buying more cattle and nutritious feed. This will enable the animals to reach a good size and weight so he can sell them for a good price. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, Manuel approached Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa to ask for a loan of 2,000 soles.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Saidahmad is married and has five children. He lives with his family in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. For the past 14 years he has been selling men\u2019s clothes in the market of Shohmansur in Dushanbe city. He buys goods and resells them with a small extra charge. He was also engaged in repairing apartments and houses. Today his working capital in his business is 6,000 US dollars ($US). Saidahmad would like to get a loan of 1400$US to buy new seasonal men\u2019s clothing according to the market demand and he hopes that lenders will support him.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Belinda, as she herself is an elementary graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nBelinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP\u2019s-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail rates. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan.  She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBelinda dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group\u2019s weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":753715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for additional grocery items for her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-20T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1735.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123611,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3470.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194993,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4338.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474069,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3470.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-20T15:10:59Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:32:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":291638,"name":"Dias Francisco","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"\nDias Francisco B. nasceu no Distrito de Guija,  Prov\u00edncia de Gaza, sul de Mo\u00e7ambique casado pai de 5 filhos de idades entre 5 a 18 anos de idade, destes 4 va\u00f5 a Escola.

She is married to Gilberto V., a security officer, and is the mother of three children, two of whom are already working. The other child is still studying in college. At this time, Marilyn is working hard to be able to send her youngest child all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Marilyn, as she herself has been a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMarilyn runs a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small amounts to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Philippine pesos' worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located next to her house. Marilyn also sells viands (prepared dishes) just beside her small variety store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her businesses, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products such as groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also use part of this loan to purchase raw ingredients for her food stall.

This is her second loan with Hluvuku, in the amount of 11,000 meticals, which she intends to use to purchase construction materials (stone, sand, cement, etc.) to continue building her house. Her previous loan was in the amount of 5500 meticals, which she also used to build her house.\r\nShe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that she'll be eligible for others in the future.

one who values dreams like gold, every effort is necessary. Josephine J., 45, exerts the best effort she can give to attain her dreams for her business and for her family. Josephine reached second year in college and is now married to Johnimar, a goldsmith. Together they live in Dasmarinas, Cavite.\r\n\r\nJosephine helps Johnimar in marketing the gold jewelry he makes. Their shop, which has been operating for 11 years now, is located on a nearby barangay in Cavite. Josephine hires four employees to help with the making of gold accessories and other items. Also, she sells products ranging from clothes to small house appliances directly to customers she knows in her community. Another source of income for their family is selling electronic loads for mobile phones. With these small-scale businesses, Josephine is able to earn around PHP 12,500 on average monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her goldsmith shop, Josephine is requesting a 38,000 PHP loan. In keeping with her learning from the lessons CCT gives on entrepreneurship, Josephine will use this loan to pay for materials necessary in making gold jewelry. Josephine sees this as a big help to her capital, which will eventually impact her business income greatly.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there are a lot of challenges every micro entrepreneur faces every day, but Josephine chooses to focus on her golden dreams. It is her desire for her business to become famous in their place and eventually gain more branches in other towns. \r\n\r\nFor her family, she prays to have their own dream house in time. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Lourdes C., a CCT* community partner, sees its value in her life. At 57, she has some college learning to look back to, but what helps her a lot with her business now is her involvement in the entrepreneurial trainings and Bible studies in CCT. \r\n\r\nLourdes is married to Bonifacio, and together they have three children. Their family resides in Dasmarinas, Cavite.\r\n\r\nLourdes is part of the food industry on the local level. She sells smoked fish and dried fish along with cold cuts and frozen food. Because her sales depend on the demand of her regular customers in the community, her income varies every month, but it averages roughly PHP 11,300.\r\n\r\nWith no employees to help her, Lourdes has been working perseveringly for ten years now.\r\n\r\nA loan worth PHP 20,000 is deemed necessary for Lourdes to help her grow her business. She then applies for such, intending to use the money to purchase more quantities of in-demand food such as frozen food and smoked fish. She wants to do this so that she will not run out of stocks in case her customers order more than what they usually buy.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for Lourdes to face the months of vacation, because then her sales drop low. But she strives to come up with strategies to make her business continue gaining profits even during vacation. She aspires for continuous improvement in her business and increasing growth in profits because her family depends on it for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":753778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more quantities of dried fish and frozen food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-20T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6869.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123614,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6869.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195000,"comment":null},{"amount":126.66,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5495.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474072,"comment":null},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333.38,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1373.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636853,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-20T17:56:16Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":291673,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 37 years old and married with four children.

can see life as a fabric into which either golden threads or burlap are woven. For Geraldine L., 35, each thread is valuable as it makes her and her family's lives worth living. Aside from being a micro-entrepreneur, Geraldine is also a wife to Samuel, a car air conditioner technician, and a mother to three children, one of whom is in high school while the other two go to elementary school. Their family lives in Dasmarinas, Cavite. \r\n\r\nDoormat making is Geraldine's main business. She uses scrap cloth to produce beautiful doormats that are sold at prices afforded by her fellow community members. Geraldine has been operating this business for three years now in their home in Dasmarinas. \r\n\r\nOther than doormat making, she is also into direct selling. She brings with her catalogs of the apparel brand Board Walk and other beauty brands, gets orders from customers in the neighborhood, purchases the orders, and delivers the products to the customers. She earns profits out of the commission. Summing it all up, Geraldine earns a net income of 7,900 Philippine pesos (PHP) every month. \r\n\r\nTo help her grow her doormat making business, Geraldine decides to loan an amount of 14,000 PHP. She believes that with the entrepreneurial training and spiritual support CCT* gives her, she will be able to channel the loan into appropriate business measures and increase her income. She plans to purchase more cloth in order to be able to produce more doormats. Part of the loan will also go to purchasing more Board Walk products for her direct selling business. \r\n\r\nGiven the challenges Geraldine refuses to specifically mention, she then focuses on making the golden threads and the burlap of her life come together to produce a majestic fabric, the fulfillment of her dreams. Simply, this includes profound growth for her business and a college diploma for each of her dear children. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":753784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase cloth for doormat weaving and home products for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-20T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geraldine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":4666.65,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4699.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123615,"comment":null},{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":4666.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4699.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195002,"comment":null},{"amount":86.66,"local_amount":3733.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3759.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474073,"comment":null},{"amount":21.67,"local_amount":933.38,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":940.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636854,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-20T16:44:14Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":291675,"name":"Helena Veronica","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"\nHelena Veronica M. nasceu na cidade de Xai Xai, Prov\u00edncia de Gaza, sul de Mo\u00e7ambique casada m\u00e3e de 7 filhos de idades entre 08 a 38 anos, os mais novos ainda  continuam a estudar.

She is married and the mother of 7 children between the ages of 8 and 38. The youngest children are still in school. Helena attends 10th grade. She did not finish school when she was young because of financial difficulties. She lives in her own house with her family and does not support anyone other than her children.\r\n\r\nWhen she was still very young, she left Gaza to move to Maputo with her parents. After marrying, she moved to Boane with her family. For more than 10 years Helena has had her own business selling kitchen ware. She has no employees and has a monthly income of about 3,500 meticais. She uses this money for household expenses and manages to save some in her bank account because her husband, who works at the utilities company Eletricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique, helps her.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks, and she learned about Hluvuku through her neighbor, who is a customer of this institution. This is Helena's first Hluvuku loan, and she is asking for 20,000 meticais. She intends to buy merchandise (plates, glasses, flatware, pans and other items) to increase her stock.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay on time so she can take out other loans in the future. She plans to ask for new loans so she can expand her sales stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":753789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She is married to Donato G., a tricycle driver, and is the mother of three children, who are all studying at the public elementary school nearby. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Susan, as she herself has been an elementary graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children. \r\n\r\nSusan operates a food stall. She offers basic and mostly in-demand viands for breakfast and lunch in her community. In the Philippines, a food stall is usually found in communities both small and big. Filipinos who are always on the rush early in the morning prefer to buy ready-to-eat food from a food stall like Susan's to cooking for themselves. Serving her community, she earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) monthly. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more raw ingredients for her food stall business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusan dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She also prays that her children who already have their own families will be able to have their own house and lot for their respective families. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting * where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis.

Carmelita buys these items at a dealer's price and sells them at the price published in the product catalogs.  Her earnings is based on sales commission.  She also manages a small mineral water refilling station which is adjacent to her house. Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 PHP.  \r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her businesses, Carmelita is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan.  She plans to use this loan to buy boxes of food supplements ordered in advance by her customers.  She will also use part of this loan to pay for more cases of mineral water for her refilling business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her businesses.\r\n\r\nCarmelita dreams of being able to give all her children a high-quality education through her hard work in her businesses.

She is married to Ireneo M., a shoe repairman. They have been blessed with children who are still studying right now. At this time, Delia is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Delia, as she herself is a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children. \r\n\r\nDelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos' worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 45,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDelia dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She looks forward to having her children get a stable job someday. Delia also prays for her own commercial space in their public market. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting* where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

Rysbaeva's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sairan R., 49, is the leader of this group. She is a mother of four children, the oldest of whom is 19 years old. For six years, since the start-up of her business, Sairan and her children have worked hard for the major part of the daytime. The family buys young calves, breeds them and resells them at a higher price. Sairan says that the hardest part is covering all the costs related to feeding and providing healthy conditions for cattle breeding. Approximately every month, Sairan takes a head of cattle for sale to a local market. A couple of years ago she increased her stock from three heads to ten heads. The initial capital of 4,000 KGS was returned in a month of operating the business. Sairan believes in a bright future for her business, therefore decided to broaden her stock by applying for a loan from Kiva. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

Soliboy is 42 years old. He is married and the father of two children. He is a livestock breeder who buys and sells cattle from different market places. He has been in this business for the last 20 years. His main customers are butchers and livestock farmers. With this loan from Kiva, Soliboy plans to increase his herd of cattle for trade and, if possible, open up his own butchery. This, he says, will increase his turnover. He plans to see his children go through higher education and be able to get good jobs, unlike himself. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

My business is selling fruit salads. I have a cart that I walk with to sell the cups of fruit salad. I am requesting my loan so that I can buy a new tarp that will protect me from the sun and will also protect the fruit salads. I would also like to buy a new coat and buy the fruit that I need. Honestly, I sell well in my business, and I can't complain about the sales; it is only the walking and pushing the cart in the season when it gets cold, because sales go down. But now it is going to go well for me, since we are in the times when there is a lot of sun, and the people like to snack on something cool.

I have been in a common law relationship for the last 10 years.  Recently we finished building our own house since we had previously been living in my parent's home.  The four children that I have go to elementary school and there are many expenses because the teachers constantly ask for things that the children need to bring to school.  I make a living by raising sheep.  I am asking for the loan to be able to buy sheep and be able to raise them.  Taking care of the animals is simple for me because I have a corral and I leave them there and only take food and water for them to eat and drink.  The corral has a roof and this way they are protected from the weather.  I hope that when it comes time to sell them they will fetch a good price.  Many times when people see that one is in a hurry to sell the animals, they take advantage and want to buy them cheaper and I don't make the profit that I should make.

Lety has taken care of Santiago since he was born since her daughter was studying and now she works as an accountant.\r\n\r\nLety is requesting this loan to invest in her business selling fine (gold) jewelry.  She buys her stock in the city of Morole\u00f3n Guanajuato since they offer her good prices in that city because she has been a customer for 12 years.  She can then raise the price just a little and not have to sell her jewelry for too high a price.

However, there are still some necessary renovations that she has not yet been able to do due to budgetary constraints. One of the planned improvements is to install a window that would provide more light and also to paint both the inside and the outside of the salon to give it a more attractive and lively appearance.

She says that she began this project because her husband started to buy the plants by threes every two weeks, and she cultivated them. Thus, little by little they established their farm. During harvest time, she goes out to sell her avocados by the bucketful at the central warehouse of Zitacuaro, and sometimes they rent trees that already have fruit to customers. She is requesting a loan from the financial institution to buy fertilizers and hoses for irrigation, since the water source is a little bit far away, and this will help her reach all the trees to water them, so they don't dry out during this hot season.

This community is noted for the fact that there are several PEMEX oil wells located there.  In this community there is a group called 'Barahunda'.  The group chose this name because it is the name of their community and also because the word means 'fiesta', 'bustle' or 'noise\" which describes this very cheerful and united group.\r\n\r\nElia Moran is one of the group's members.  She is 60 years old and has six children who are all married.  She currently lives with two of her grandchildren.  She tells us that more than 7 years ago she wanted to work and, with the support of her children, she opened a furniture store in her community called \"Muebleria Diana\" (Diana's Furniture Store) in honor of her youngest granddaughter.  Elia also raises pigs.  She has a small farmyard behind her home where she keeps her pigs.  Elia needs this loan to invest in buying feed for her pigs and some household products (chests of drawers, blenders, mixers and irons) to re-stock her business.\r\n\r\nElia hopes that this loan will help her to make progress in her business and that her sales will increase since she would like to make good profits so that she can paint her business and continue investing in it.

Open Tuesday through Sunday from 11 in the morning to 12 at night, it is closed Monday so that Jose and Sylvia can spend time with Jose\u2019s elderly mother.   As Sylvia says, \u201cOur customers are our friends and family.\u201d  Their loyal clientele includes locals as well as \u201cWinter Texans\u201d who come from as far away as Canada to spend winters in the small town of Donna in the Rio Grande Valley.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Joe acquired the bar from an elderly man wanting to retire.  In order to work the bar, Joe took a temporary leave of absence from H-E-B, a Texas grocery store where he had worked for eighteen years.  At the end of three months, Joe realized that he loved owning the bar and resigned from H-E-B.\r\nJoe and Sylvia live in a house across the street from the bar.  They work hard to make \u201cJoe\u2019s Hide Out\u201d a fun place to be. \r\n\r\nEvery day, Joe and his wife serve free \"botana\" (snacks) like squash and chicken, beef and potatoes, and hot dogs.  Recognizing their generosity, customers sometimes pitch in to help cover the cost.  Even when that doesn\u2019t happen, Joe and Sylvia believe it is worth it, because it is fun and attracts business.\r\n\r\nAnother tradition at \u201cJoe\u2019s Hide Out\u201d is the rule is that whoever rings the bell must buy a round for everyone in the bar.  Sometimes Joe rings the bell, which gets the customers excited and typically leads to their buying rounds for each other.  On the weekends, Jose, Sylvia, and their friends and customers barbecue on their outside grill.  They have musicians come and play music while customers eat, drink, and dance on the patio.\r\n\r\nThis is Joe and Sylvia\u2019s second loan with ACCION Texas-Louisiana.  With their first loan, they expanded the bar, added pool tables, and bought a television.  With this loan, they will fix the bar\u2019s air conditioner and repair their parking lot.

She is married to Macario L., a vendor, and is the mother of four children, two of whom are already working, while the others are still in school. By the grace of God, Helen has managed to support her older child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send the rest of her children all the way through college--a dream for most Filipino parents like Helen, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a fish stall. Fish is bought fresh from nearby ports and piers, packed in ice and then brought to the local markets. Helen and her husband clean, gut and chop fish per customer orders. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 350 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy fish for their everyday inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHelen dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes that her family can migrate and work in other countries in the near future. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
