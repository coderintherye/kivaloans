For the past 4 years she has dedicated herself to attending to her small grocery store, while also selling food; her business is out of her home, which is located in a high traffic and commercial area in her neighborhood. Midday is when she has the most clients, and it is because of this that often her husband helps, however, he cannot do this every day because he has his own work. Miriam works hard to organize her time given that she has to cook the food that she offers, attend to her store, and also has to drop off and pick up her small daughter from kindergarten.

The money that she requests will be invested in the purchase of merchandise for her store, and she will also acquire supplies (sacks of rice and sugar) and other ingredients wholesale to prepare the meals she sells. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":322411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To increase her merchandise.

The group members are from the town of Quillabamba, about five hours from the city of Cusco in the province of La Convencion. Quillabamba is referred to as the \u201ceyebrow of the jungle.\u201d The climate is hot and humid, and the area produces many of the bananas, oranges and papayas that are consumed in Cusco. \r\n\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of different activities. For example, Hilda is 32 years old and is the single mother of one child. She and her mother sell prepared lunches at the local market in Quillabamba. For example, today\u2019s meal was noodle soup and fish or pork chops with beans. Hilda starts preparing each day\u2019s meal at 8:30 am. The food is ready by 10 am; then she leaves for the market so that she is ready for each day\u2019s early customers. Hilda also sells perfume by catalog as an extra source of income. She is requesting a loan of 500 soles to buy the perfume that her customers request. She collects payments on a monthly basis. Hilda\u2019s goal for the future is to open her own store and buy a hamburger cart to sell snacks at night. \r\n\r\nHilda\u2019s aunt, Celia, is also a group member. Celia is 45 years old and lives with her partner and their three children. She also has a lunch stand in Quillabamba\u2019s Mercado Sat\u00e9lite, and has been serving meals for the past eight years. Celia is requesting a loan of 1000 soles so that she can put in a cement floor in her home. Her current floor is dirt. \r\n\r\nAnother group member, Maritza, is 31 years old and lives with her partner. She recently started her own business bringing alcohol from Quillabamba to Cusco to sell to stores in the city. She travels every two weeks or so and brings between 110 and 140 kilos of alcohol on each trip. She earns about 50 centimos (17 cents US ) for each kilo she sells, so she earns a total of 50 to 70 soles ($17 to $23) per trip. Maritza is requesting a loan of 1000 soles to buy more alcohol. Each kilo costs 2.35 soles, so her loan will buy her about 425 kilos, enough for 3-4 trips to Cusco.\r\n\r\nLos Diamantes have pledged to repay their loan in full and on time. They are the first group from Quillabamba to be listed on Kiva! Their loan officer, Ramiro, is pictured in the red shirt on the far right. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":322507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy perfume and alcohol, and to install a cement floor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Quillabamba - La Convenci\u00f3n - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Placida Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11600,"loan_amount":3825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1748.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1818.79},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1891.54},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1967.21},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2045.9},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2127.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":576.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":599.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":623.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":648.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":674.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":701.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":576.73,"local_amount":1749.04,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1756.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918341,"comment":null},{"amount":599.66,"local_amount":1818.58,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1825.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139183,"comment":null},{"amount":623.72,"local_amount":1891.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1899.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564802,"comment":null},{"amount":648.67,"local_amount":1967.21,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1975.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998365,"comment":null},{"amount":674.62,"local_amount":2045.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2054.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910618,"comment":null},{"amount":701.6,"local_amount":2127.73,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2136.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103749940,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-12T23:49:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T11:35:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109790,"name":"Las Intachables Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las socias del banco comunal \"Las Intachables\" esta representado por L. se\u00f1ora Victoria y presenta un parentesco familiar entre  L. se\u00f1ora Roxana Julieta y su hermana L. se\u00f1ora Amalia ambas se dedican al comercio de diferentes productos por lo que tienen ingresos independientes una de L. otra.

Gloria is waiting for the water to evaporate to allow the bulbs (which contain the seeds) to mature. She will then harvest the seeds in order to get back some of the initial investment. The good thing is that once she has the seeds, she will be able to plant new patches, which will get her money back in 8 months. For the moment, her other crops will be enough to provide for the basic needs of the home and the education of her children. This is the 5th loan she has sought from MFP, and she has not had a single problem with her payments in the past, since she has always paid on time. She is very active in her community bank, and always thinks about the well-being of her fellow members. With the money that she's asking for, she will buy chemical fertilizers for her other patches of potatoes and gladiola.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":322576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-24T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3045,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-24T22:43:25Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109823,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es una persona tranquila y d\u00f3cil, vive con su pareja y padre de sus dos hijos en su casa propia desde hace un a\u00f1o, por la cual trabaj\u00f3 mucho para obtener.

is engaged in a native hog raising business in their poor and remote village of St. Teresa in Lallo, Cagayan. He is 30 years old and married to Wilma, 28 years old, who is a housewife.\r\n\r\nHe was glad that he was given opportunity to have his pig to raise considering that most residents in their village lack income opportunities and most have low educational attainment. Through serving as rented farm laborer and tilling his small farm lot and by patiently raising his pig, Onofre is able to continuously support the education of his two children and provide their daily living. \r\n\r\nOnofre finds it difficult to keep his pig raising progressing due to lack of finances to supply feed for the animal to grow and produce piglets. Thus, he is requesting a loan of PHP 4,000 for maintenance of the business and also to use for some other needs. He hopes to improve his business and somehow is planning to put up a pig house where he can secure his livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":322680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For

L. is from the village of Poblacion 1 Clarin Misamis Occidental. She is 34 years old. Yolanda is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Yolanda owns & operates a butcher shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from butchering and selling roasted pig (lechon) in the community. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine Pesos (about US $170) a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2009, Yolanda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 pesos which will be used to purchase livestock. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Yolanda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as savings for her children's future. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<P>\r\nnGata Daku Multi-Purpose Cooperative (GDMPC) aims to empower people by providing livelihood opportunities through various types of services.

lives in the village of Barangay Natappian West Solana, Cagayan. Her husband works as a simple farmer. While free from farming duties, Jenny operates their old \u201ckalesa\u201d transport business that still exists in Solana, Cagayan. A \u201ckalesa\u201d is a cart which is pulled by a horse. Its use dates back to the Spanish regime in the Philippines. Jenny says that the \u201ckalesa\u201d is helpful to their daily living. It does not require the expense of gasoline, which is also a great contribution to the environment. She further said that this type of transportation will last for a long time and is something they can rely on. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is asking for a loan of PHP 13,000 for business necessities such as improvement of the cart used in their transportation business. The cart they use is old and is in need of repair in order to give their passenger comfort as they ride. Jenny is 24 years old and soon will have a child to support with its education and basic needs.

Juanita runs a general store and has struggled to expand it because she lacks the capital to make improvements. She is requesting a loan to get working capital to make these improvements happen. With this loan, Juanita plans to buy more groceries in bulk and more of the items in highest demand among her customers, such soft drinks, cosmetics, canned goods, soaps and other items. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to expand her business because she knows this can help improve her family's life. She says that the loan she is requesting will be paid back through hard work and perseverance so she may succeed. Juanita also hopes to provide the child she has now and any others she may have in the future with better education. She is praying that her loan request is granted soon.

A. is from the village of Gata Daku, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 43 years old. Teresita is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Teresita owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Teresita is just starting this business.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2005, Teresita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 Philippine Pesos which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Teresita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<P>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Marionito is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used as working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marionito from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his busines. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":322791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

married and is the father of 4 children.  Abdumachid has a flock of small-horned livestock, composed of around 40 sheep and 20 goats.  His wife is a homemaker, but in her free time she processes yarn and knits a variety of warm clothing.  She sells this clothing to neighbors or relatives.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning Abdumachid takes his flock to pasture in the mountains, tends them and in the evening brings them back.  For now Abdumachid does not have large-horned livestock.  But Abdumachid would like to use this new loan to purchase two medium bulls.  After fattening them for 3-4 months he will be able to sell them for a very good price.  Abdumachid is very happy to work with us, because the credit helps him very much.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":322796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase two bulls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-28T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdumachid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":538.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001200,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":538.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846363,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-28T05:05:39Z","paid_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109938,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria B. is a vegetable vendor and village store owner in their village at Casili Mallig, Isabela.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to send her children to school and pursue their education to college level for she believes that education is the only treasure that she can give them.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Nurullo is a lively entrepreneur with a small business selling shoes for women at the central market in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ahmadbek is 44 years old, married, and has two children. He grows wheat and potato and sells them in the market for income. He has been in the farming business for almost six years and has gained much experience. Ahmadbek has a large family which includes his parents. He works almost everyday to generate revenue to support his family's needs. As his family relies on his crop, Ahmadbek needs a loan to purchase necessary supplies for his current harvest. This will be his first loan with IMON International and Kiva, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For these reasons, she\u2019s asking WAGES for her first loan to buy four boxes of hair extensions,  some cosmetic products, and five bolts of high quality <i>pagnes<\/i>.  She is married and the mother of one child. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

N. is a 60 year old woman, married, and the mother of five children. All of them are independent except the last born who is currently in school.\r\n\r\nThrough hard work, Adwoa provides support for her kids education. She is a food vendor who has sold kenkey in her neighborhood for the past twenty years. Kenkey is prepared from milled maize grains, cooked and taken with hot pepper, gravy stew or any kind of soup and fried fish or meat. She has many customers since many Ghanaians enjoy kenkey as breakfast, lunch and supper. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Adwoa wants to buy more raw materials like bags of maize, meat, fish, vegetables and firewood. As part of her business expansion, Adwoa has added cooked rice and stew to her product line.

She is married and the mother of 2 children, the first is 6, and the second is 3 years old.  The oldest goes to school, and the youngest is in day care.\r\n\r\nWhen her father was transferred to work in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, he took his family with him.  Of course she was only a baby and could not stay far from her parents.  After she was 6 she began her schooling.  She was able to take a teaching course for 2 years then was stationed in Goba, a town 50 km from Namaacha.\r\n\r\nIn that same year she became pregnant with her boyfriend who was studying in the capital.  Life became very difficult for Amelia since she had to care for her pregnancy and pay for the schooling of her boyfriend, which was not easy.  She was able to overcome all of those obstacles when she approached BIM to solicit a loan for 20,000MT to purchase some land.  She was able to pay it off without any problems.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with her friends she came to know about the existence of Hluvuku, and she requested a loan to begin her work.  Amelia works from 7:00am until 12:00pm earning 7,557MT per month.  She is able to save 2,000MT monthly and she counts on the help of her husband who is still working.

Once she was informed about the program, she was able to get together 15 women who are now working very well in their 8th loan cycle, in a mutually supportive manner.\r\n\r\nDuring the loan cycles, the group has passed through some difficult times. The Director General\u2019s daughter was very ill and admitted to the hospital. Another of the members was very ill and bedridden for a while.  Because the group was very supportive, it accepted responsibility and responded without any trouble; it was able to pull through and continues to work in the program to this day.\r\n\r\nThe average loan size per member is 735.00 PYG, which will be used for different activities, such as: food sales, sewing notions sales, grocery sales (rice, sugar, noodles, dairy products, breads, herbs, etc.), clothing sales, lingerie sales, cosmetics sales, fruit and vegetable sales, cleaning products sales, crochet sales, etc. \r\n\r\nAll of the members work to raise funds and they help each other so that they can achieve the goals they all have in common as a group in the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.

She is a very enterprising mother.  She lives in her own home with her partner, with whom she has 5 children whom she wants to give good educations.  This is the motive for which she is disposed to work arduously.  She works raising pigs, and sometimes growing vegetables.  Her pigs are in much asked for in the local markets of Tarma, and she already has loyal clients for her sales.  Because of this she tries to feed her animals from the time they are born until they are very fat.  Each day she gets up very early to care for and feed her pigs, which she raises with much tenderness as she knows that thanks to them she has the money to maintain her family.  The 4 years that she has spent in this business has given her the experience to have control over the balanced food that she gives them during 6 months, when they are ready for sale.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about this activity is that at the same time she is able to work growing vegetables because she raises her pigs in a space of her home.  In the future, Armanda hopes to increase the number of her animals, and at the same time she wants to renovate the fence around the place where her pigs are.  This is her ninth loan with MFP, where she has demonstrated herself as a very responsible client with her repayments, and where at times she has given time working in the labours of the director of her community bank.  The money that she is asking for is to buy concentrated food to fatten her pigs, and the rest for the work of a bricklayer who will build the fence of her stable.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":323132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy food for Armanda's pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-25T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1058.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733851,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-25T03:17:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110129,"name":"Celia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celia es una mujer que a sus 54 a\u00f1os de edad sigue teniendo fuerzas para progresar, es soltera, y aunque no tiene hijos, ese espacio lo compensa con el amor que le brinda a su sobrina que cr\u00eda desde muy ni\u00f1a.

Aunque con forme fueron pasando los a\u00f1os, la competencia fue aumentando, Celia se mantuvo firme con su bodega, negocio que le ha dado muchas satisfacciones, por ello se levanta muy temprano para hacer la limpieza de todos los andamios de su local, y comprar los panecillos calientes para ofrecer a sus clientes. En todos estos a\u00f1os ha ganado mucha experiencia, aprendi\u00f3 a que el trato a sus clientes es muy importante en este negocio, y con ello ha sabido incrementar su clientela regular. Las ganancias que obtiene son para su propio sostenimiento y para cubrir la educaci\u00f3n de su sobrina, a quien sostiene como a su propia hija. Este es su noveno cr\u00e9dito con MFP, cabe recalcar que Celia es una de las fundadoras de su banco comunal y en todo este tiempo ha demostrado ser una cliente muy puntual, por ello que es muy respetada por los dem\u00e1s integrantes.

She is single and although she doesn\u2019t have children, in this space she compensates with the love she brings to the niece that she has raised since she was very young.  When she was a child, she worked at a bakery, a very hard activity, but it gave her a good profit and enabled her to rent her home.  But due to physical pain, she changed this business to sell food in a store that she began in her home.  Although the years were passing, she improved her skills.  Celia maintained herself well in the shop, a business that has given her much satisfaction.  For this she gets up very early to do the cleaning of all the scaffolding in her location and to buy the hot breads to offer to her clients.  In all these years she has gained much experience, learning that the treatment of her clients is very important in this business, and with this she has been able to increase her regular clients.  The earnings that she gets are for her own sustenance, and to cover the education of her niece, whom she supports as her own daughter.  This is her ninth loan with MFP.  It should be emphasized that Celia is one of the founders of her community bank, and in all this time she has demonstrated herself as a very punctual client.
