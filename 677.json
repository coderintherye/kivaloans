Members Ana Maria and Juana are going to buy a bundle of corn.\r\n\r\nIsabel is 58 years old, she studied until the third grade, and lives with her husband and they have 4 older children already working. They live in a very pretty little village with many hills. Many tourists visit in order to buy pottery.\r\n\r\nShe sells food and Mexican antojitos (street snacks). She began her business 10 years ago learning through work how to run an economical kitchen. She bought kitchen utensils little by little, such as saucers, chairs, pots, and dishes to make casseroles, and sauce pans with which to do her work with the income she was taking in. Her business is on a highway, 5 minutes walking distance from her home.\r\n\r\nShe offers her clients who are tourists dobladitas (quick bread, rolled into circles and folded into layers), picaditas (tortilla boats with various fillings) beef jerky, tlacoyas (oval shaped fried cakes made from masa), and beef stew.\r\n\r\nShe likes to give good customer service to her clients, giving them what they ask for.

Sen is a 51-year-old married woman who comes from a low-income family in the Baray district of the Kompong Tom province.

is Alberto, 55, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Perlita, a buy-and-sell trader, and mother to his four children. By the grace of God, Alberto has managed to support his children's schooling. He is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlberto operates a Jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have one (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which is paying boundary (a fee) each day. Alberto and his wife also manage their fruit-and-vegetables stand. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 350 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and parts for their jeepney. Part of the loan will be used to buy additional stock of fruits and vegetables. He expects a boost in his income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nAlberto hopes his business grows more this coming year and dreams to be able to give his children a high-quality education through all his hard work at his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members** to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an earning opportunity, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every-day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n**All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":877717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for spare parts and maintenance of their Jeepney unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-26T01:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2173.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764669,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.99,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2897.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571794,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2896.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529344,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2897.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-26T04:32:53Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":339286,"name":"Teresa De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa de Jes\u00fas, vive en casa propia en la zona oriental del pa\u00eds en zona urbana junto a  su compa\u00f1ero de vida Manuel,  mam\u00e1 y dos sobrinos menores de edad por quienes ella es quien responde econ\u00f3micamente a falta de sus padres.

is Estella, 41, resident of Silang Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Hernanie, and is a mother to their three children. One is studying in college, another is in elementary school, and the oldest is currently seeking an entry-level job. She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses and support the schooling of her two children. \r\n\r\nEstella operates a variety store, a mini food house, and a food delivery. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells cooked viands (food items) and delivers cooked food for added income. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She has a minimum of 700 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and raw ingredients for her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEstella hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to buy a car for their food delivery business just as she fervently hopes that her two children will be able to finish their studies and graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":877724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay

Sumayah is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala North region of Uganda. For the past 10 years, Sumayah has been working hard to manage her tailoring business, which makes adjustments to clothes and also makes clothes from scratch. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sumayah has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a sewing machine and more cloth, and will help Sumayah to generate greater profits and buy food to feed her family. Sumayah hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nSumayah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Sumayah's future prospects by helping her to start her

He has been working in agriculture and raising livestock for 10 years, and learned this trade from his father. As his family had limited financial resources, he did not have the opportunity to study and therefore started working at a very young age.  To acquire the supplies he needs for his work, Oscar has to walk 10 minutes to the place where he waits for a van to pick him up, travels in the van for 45 minutes and then travels one hour by bus.\r\n\r\nOscar has requested this loan from the foundation in order to purchase a team of oxen. He has realized that almost none of the neighboring communities have oxen to carry out agricultural work (such as plowing soil for planting). He has seen an opportunity to earn good income, as he will charge for the work undertaken for the people in the neighboring communities.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Oscar could generate a revenue that will allow him to send their three small children to school, as he does not want his children to have the same standard of living. Oscar wants his children to be prepared professionally. He also wants to buy some land to grow corn and beans. Through the sale of his produce he would increase his income, which he would invest in buying more cattle, and would also store some of the corn and beans to ensure there is enough food for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":310.8,"image":{"id":877525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a team of oxen","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Arnulfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":92.67,"local_amount":92.67,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":92.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797195,"comment":null},{"amount":82.85,"local_amount":82.85,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":82.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182506,"comment":null},{"amount":135.28,"local_amount":135.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":135.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317636,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T20:39:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":339601,"name":"Margarita Trinidad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Margarita Trinidad tiene 25 a\u00f1os, hace m\u00e1s de 1 a\u00f1o que se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos.
