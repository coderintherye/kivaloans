Sarah sells Irish potatos in the Kibuye market.  Her plan is to expand her business to become a wholesaler of potatoes supplying hotels and restaurants in her area.  She says that her work can be challenging because if she doesn\u2019t have enough customers her potatoes spoil. \r\n<p>\r\nSarah hopes that her children can get a proper education. Sarah is also a Community healthcare worker, which means that she visits the sick, elderly, and vulnerable people in her community on a regular basis. As a Community Healthcare Worker, she wishes that she could have more money to support the people that she visits \u2013 many of them are undernourished. \r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional microfinance institution. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya.  Many of the loan recipients from this organization are volunteer community healthcare workers like Sarah.

the past two years, Esther has been trading in the local market of Kasoa in Ghana. She is a married 43-year-old with five children, all of whom are in school. She is very busy selling palm oil, rice, vegetable oil, tinned tomatoes, yams, onions, beans, maize, dried fish, etc. at her local market. Esther is convinced, however, that her business will grow better with increased capital and she therefore wants a loan for $350 USD (500 GHS) to buy more yams, baskets of tomatoes, onions, bags of maize, and beans to increase her stock.

She is 48 years old and has 5 children between the ages of 16-35.  The youngest three still attend school and she lives only with her children\u2014she doesn\u2019t have any other family members in her care.  She left Maputo after her father died.  She was very young and her mother did not have the resources to take care of her, so she was taken to Namaacha and cared for by the missionary nuns.  During her time with the nuns she learned to make handicrafts and crochet.  Years later, she met her husband and left her home with the nuns.  She began making crochet projects and selling them to co-ops.  Her work was often praised so she was able to start making large orders for a company in the capital city.  With the income from that project she bought some land.  Later, she separated from her husband and was left with 5 children to care for.  Her life was very difficult, but with the help of the missionaries she was able to overcome those difficulties.  They gave a base and she was able to build some rooms to rent out.  Today she is the owner of 5 small apartments, 2 of which are functioning and provide her with 1.500.00MT per month in rent money.  She is also the owner of two market stalls where she sells large orders of potatoes and onions which she gets from neighboring Swaziland for the price of 160x20 and 170x20, then resells in Namaacha for the price of 200x20 and 200x20.  She saves her money in a xitique (a traditional, rotating way of saving money).  She pays 1.000.00 MT every 15 days among 12 people and each person in the rotation collects the whole account once.  She has never worked with another lending company and this is her first loan with  Hluyuku and with Kiva.  The 20.000.00MT will be used to buy construction material for her apartments.  She is very anxious to finish them so she can begin other jobs.  She is full of projects!  In the future she plans on taking out another loan and becoming a great saleswoman.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

After he recovered he entered into the business world by buying window frames and doors in neighboring Swaziland and re-selling them in the capital of Maputo.  He was able to build his own home and a commercial building.  He later changed jobs when the Mozambique government implemented a law that regulated border activity\u2014in order to monitor contraband on its way to Namaacham or Maputo.  His new job was selling basic products in a small convenience store.  He has never worked with other lending companies and this is his first loan, for 10.000,00MT, which he will use to increase the volume of his products.  He will buy rice, beans, peanuts and sugar.  He makes about 3.000.00MT and is able to save 1.000.00MT, since he is only responsible for his daughter.  He pledges to repay his loan before the determined time and hopes to receive another loan in the future.  He would like to purchase irrigation equipment  and get started in the agricultural field, since there is a large water source and fertile land in his region.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is 33 years old, married, and has one son who is 15 years old and attends school in Vila de Namaacha.\r\n\r\nJoana left Maputo after marrying to move to Vila de Namaacha on the border of Swaziland.  Upon arrival, she didn't have work for two years and later found a job as a salesperson for a company that sells beef. Her monthly wages are 3,000,000 MT, an amount that does not cover her needs. She therefore decided to continue her business of selling clothes acquired in Swaziland, but since she didn't have sufficient funding, she came to Hluvuku and Kiva to request a loan for 10,000,000 MT.  She will use the money to purchase different types of clothing for resale, as she has many orders and wants to meet her customers' needs.  The best orders are comforters, bags, and sheets on which she earns a profit of 3,000,000 MT.  She only has time to travel once per month and has managed to save 1,000,000 MT.  \r\n\r\nShe does not support anyone other than her son.  She is confident that she will repay her loan early, because she has help from her husband.  She will then request a new loan to start building and move out of her boss's house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":398.9,"image":{"id":363291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy and sell clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-08-19T03:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.1,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joana Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":582},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":608.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":635.8},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":664.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":694.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":725.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":758.8},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":793.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":828.96},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":866.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":905.6},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":946.54},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":989.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.59},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.28,"local_amount":582,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":613.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618981,"comment":null},{"amount":24.33,"local_amount":608.3,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":641.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056820,"comment":null},{"amount":31.48,"local_amount":786.92,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":829.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971776,"comment":null},{"amount":20.54,"local_amount":513.42,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":541.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816724,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":694.59,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":732.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708900,"comment":null},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":725.99,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-23T09:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":765.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118101530,"comment":null},{"amount":242.45,"local_amount":6088.78,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6417.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.1,"payment_id":123937902,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-20T15:17:31Z","paid_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126705,"name":"Grace Wambui","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace Wambui M. is 59 years old.

He was born in Vilanculos in a district of the Inhambane province.  He attended school through the 7th grade.  He is married and has a 2 year old daughter. \r\n\r\nAntonio moved out of Vilanculos to search for work with his uncle who lives in Namaacha, a town on the border with Swaziland.  He worked for his uncle for 2 years where he only earned around 150,000MT per month, an amount that didn't cover his expenses.  In 2002, Antonio decided to start his own business with money he had saved.  He moved out of his uncle's house and rented a place where he still lives for 500,000 MT per month.  He is now the owner of a shop that sells electrical appliances (located in the central market of Namaacha).  For 7 years his best merchandise has been radios, disks and cellphone rechargers acquired in Maputo for 1,000,000 MT x5, and 35.00MT x50 and resold at 2,200,000MT and 75.00MT respectively.  He has earned a profit of 5,000,000 MT and is able to save 1,000,000 MT per month.     \r\n\r\nHe supports his two siblings who live with him in his home and he has an employee who earns 1,200,000 MT per month.  He is building a house, as he really wants to live in his own home because renting is not at all easy.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with Hluvuku and his third with Kiva.  He is confident that he will pay back the loan without any problem.  The 15,000,000 MT will be used to increase his merchandise and finish building his home.  The first loans were all for his business (5.500,00 MT; 7.000,00 MT and 10.000,00 MT).  He is very grateful to Hluvuku and Kiva for having provided the financing to bring his great dream to reality.

Clarisse runs her shop out of a shipping container in a small town near Kisumu, Kenya. She sells flour, salad, bar soap, sugar, steel wool,  tea leaves, milk, and bread, amongst other items.  She will use this loan for shop supplies. <P>\r\n\r\nIn the video, Clarisse tells us about the 9 children that she cares for. She married a man whose first wife had passed away, and left 3 children.  Clarisse then has 4 children of her own, and she also cares for her sister\u2019s two children, because her sister passed away.  Clarisse\u2019s husband is a painter and has occasional work in the town. <P>\r\n\r\nClarisse hopes to keep her family in good health, and that she can continue to pay school fees for these children. They are all in school now. Clarisse also expressed that her hope is to \u201craise up the health for the sick in the community\u201d. She is a volunteer community health worker, which means that she visits her sick neighbors on a regular basis, counseling them and their caretakers.<P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional micro-finance institution. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya.  Many of the loan recipients from this organization are volunteer community healthcare workers like Clarisse.

He is in his late thirties and he lives in Ntasen, Bamenda, Cameroon.\r\n\r\nG. was motivated to become a GHAPE member in 2003 when GHAPE extended its activities to his neighborhood in Ntasen.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":363316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To

is a 56-year-old mother of three. She has been a GHAPE member since the very beginning of the organization and is now looking to take out her 9th loan from the organization. With this last loan, she is looking to expand her provision store, and she is hoping that she will be able to sell fruit and other foodstuffs in addition to the regular things to be found in a provision store, such as candles, soap, drinks, and dried goods.\r\n\r\nP. is sure that this expansion will be a success not only because of the larger selection of things that she will be able to offer to her customers, but also because of the loyal base of customers that she has as well as the experience that she has in running such a business. Because of this experience, she has been able to pick out a good business location, and has also been able to see that there is a much larger profit margin in selling fruit, as compared to other produce items.\r\n\r\nThis growth will benefit the community in that people will be able to have access to more nutritious food at any time that they would want to purchase it, and also because of the practices that P. has learned over time that aid in building her business.\r\n\r\nWith the profits of this venture, P. will be able to afford the drugs that she needs to stay healthy, and she will also be able to pay her grandchildren\u2019s school fees. In addition to this, she will be able to pay her rent and reinvest in expanding her business.\r\n\r\nPatrica originally came to GHAPE because of the long term repayment, lack of collateral and low rents. But since that time, she has found use in their training programs for business development, and also because of the follow up that GHAPE credit assistants and community members make to be able to be sure that people\u2019s businesses are succeeding and that they are getting all the help that they need to be able to stay successful into the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":363320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To expand her provision store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntarikon, Bamenda, NW.

is a mother of nine living in Mile 90, a community just outside of Bamenda, Cameroon. Living there, she has been able to take out five separate loans from GHAPE to be able to expand her farming practices, and also open up her own grocery store. \r\n\r\nWith this next loan that she is applying for, Magdaline hopes to be able to grow her store, and also support her pig farming practices, a very profitable venture in this area. \r\n\r\nShe is sure that these activities will be a success because of her prior experience in this business, and also because of the variety of products that she is able to carry in her store. This variety gives people more choices of what to buy, and it attracts them to her business as opposed to others, because of the sheer volume of what she is able to put out for sale in the store.\r\n\r\nWith the profits of this business, she will be able to continue to support the education and apprenticeship of her children in learning different skills and making their own lives more fruitful because of the empowerment that they have received. Magdaline also plans to put the money that she makes back into the business. \r\n\r\nThrough the credit and the trainings that she has received, Magdaline has been able to make a notable difference in the life of her family members, and also in the conditions that they are subject to on a daily basis. She originally came to GHAPE because of the low interest rate, but now continues to stay with the organization because of the non-monetary gains that she has received. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":363325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of

W. is a 65-year-old father of eight. He has been with GHAPE since 1999, and has been able to take out nine separate loans to be able to support his pig and fowl raising activities. For the first time, T. is looking to start another business as a motorcycle taxi driver, a rather profitable business in the area.\r\n\r\nT. will use this motorcycle to take community members throughout the area to and from their homes and places of business, and will also aid in taking their produce to market. This activity is sure to succeed, T. thinks, because he will be the driver of this bike himself, rather than paying other people to take care of the machine and drive people around. With this being the case, he will be riding the bike more carefully than other people, working harder, while also being able to cut down on the maintenance needs of the bike. \r\n\r\nAs he generates profits from this activity, T. will be using the money to invest in the education of his children, and also to improve on his family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nOriginally coming to GHAPE, T. saw that they were one of the best options for providing credit in the area, as they have lower interest rates, more agreeable terms on their loans, and a payment plan that is not very stressful. In addition to this, T. has been able to enjoy GHAPE training on how to manage his business, his money, and also on how to operate in his family life and day to day dealings with other people.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":363332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Mercy trusts her business will be a successful one because she thinks she has a good site at which she operates her business. Her customer base is also consistent and Mercy is skillful in her activities. \r\n\r\nLike most entrepreneurial mothers, Mercy plans to use the profits from the loans to pay for her children\u2019s school fees.

Mercy enjoys being a GHAPE member and likes the group of entrepreneurs she works with. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

She has worked as a docent in the Diriangen School for 20 years.  This client has two children.  The eldest is 17 years old, or of school age, and is in his fifth year of secondary education.  The younger daughter is 14 years old, and she is in her third year of secondary education.  This client is known for being responsible, honest, and hardworking.  Her husband is a businessmen who travels to the area of the Municipality Nueva Guinea to buy livestock with a brother.  They share the family\u2019s household expenses, and they are a family of few resources but they are very tight-knit.  This loan would be repaid in two years and so little by little to go on improving their home.  They live in the area San Antonio in a neighbourhood where each day the population is increasing.

Paute is a tourist area in the province of Azuay, characterized by its tropical climate, green spaces, plantations, sugar cane fields and a variety of fruit produced by its inhabitants.  The members of the communal bank are business owners who sell different products in the market such as fruit, vegetables, meats, prepared meals, and other items. These women are very kind, respectful, organized, and they work well with one another.  \r\n<p>\r\nMercedes is 45 years old, in a common law marriage, and has 3 children.  Her oldest child attends high school in Paute.  Mercedes could only afford to finish elementary school, in contrast to her partner who completed two years of college.  Living in a house full of people who are willing to work and help with her business, she is thankful to God for the family that she has.  Mercedes has been working at her bakery for quite some time, approximately 7 years.  Her loan of $330 will be invested into her business.  She works a schedule of 11-12 hours, 5 days a week.  Mercedes earns about $20 each week selling bread, which helps tremendously because her family gets to keep the bread that is not sold as a result of competition.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR.  She was invited by her friends to join the group.  Her goal for the future is to acquire a location for her bakery since she currently makes bread from home.  Mercedes says this will help her to market her bread, along with cakes, pastries, desserts and other delicacies.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is a native of Cuenca and lives in the neighborhood of San Jos\u00e9 de Balsay.

Ercilia is a member of the Mujeres Unidas (United Women) Communal Bank, a large group of women that meets every two weeks at the ESPOIR office in Jipijapa, a small town on the Ecuadorian coast.  She is a lovely and friendly woman who enjoys talking with people.  Sra. Ercilia is in a common law marriage and the mother of 2 children.  Unfortunately, her daughter died at the age of 16.  Her son is finishing his high school education at the moment and hopes to continue his studies and become a doctor someday.  She is looking at the possibility of sending him to medical school in Guayaquil.  Her husband is a technician who spends his time repairing computers, televisions and radios.  Lately, he has not had much business due to a lack of customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Ercilia sells shoes door-to-door.  She sells women\u2019s shoes from a catalog called \u201cEl Cleo\u201d, and her customers place their orders and pay with cash or on credit.  She started her business 13 years ago with the help of a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir.  Sra. Ercilia still remembers that her first loan was in the amount of 130 sucres (Ecuador was still using another currency at the time and had not started using the US dollar).  Her customers are municipal workers, hospital employees, and teachers.  She leaves home every day to take orders and collect payments.  Already she has gained considerable business experience, knowing which clients to grant credit and which ones to refuse.   As a saleswoman, she says it is better to sell door-to-door rather than from a fixed location because she can go find her clients and collect from them rather than sit in one place all day.  She has around 30 regular clients and sells about 2 dozen pairs of shoes each month.  Her customers would also request American brand shoes, which she would have shipped to her in a suitcase.  However, that did not prove to be profitable, so she prefers to sell through the catalog.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Ercilia will use her loan to buy more shoes to offer to her clients.  She enjoys working because she likes having her own income, which she uses to buy clothes for herself and her son also.  Her dream for the future is to open a <i>cevicher\u00eda<\/i> in Guayaquil.  If her son ends up going to medical school there, then she could visit him all the time and do his laundry.

Lunches generally consist of a soup and a main course, while afternoon snacks might be rice stews and roasted meat (chicken or beef).  She starts cooking in the morning, and customers begin to arrive for lunch at 11 am.  She finishes selling food at 9 or 9:30 at night.  Each day, she sells 20 lunches and 30 afternoon snacks.

This area is located an hour from the city of Cuenca, and the land is environmentally sensitive.  The primary crops of the region are:  corn, beans, barley, wheat, peas, and potatoes.  In the lower sections, sugar cane and fruit trees are grown.\r\n\r\nThe town is surrounded by silver and iron mines to the north and south, and in the south there are also lime pits.  Agriculture is the primary industry, and many also dedicate themselves to producing hand-made straw hats.  \r\n\r\nThis cooperative bank is comprised of people that are very collaborative, organized, and punctual.  Carrying out farming tasks is the fundamental base for their companionship, and when anyone needs assistance they all come together as a group to help.  They also work together during festivals.\r\n\r\nMariam is 24 years old, and has 3 children ages 7, 5 and 3.  The two oldest study at the school in Ruizho.  She lives in her parents\u2019 home, is single, and has been a member of the bank for a long time.  This is her fourth loan, and she has dedicated herself since a young girl to raising chickens.  This is a familiar arena for her, given that her whole family is in the same business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting today is to invest in chickens and feed.  She tells us that she wants to acquire three boxes of chickens, which each have 100 chickens in them.  They are one day old and cost $84 USD per box.  The time to raise and fatten them is 8 weeks, until they reach about 6 pounds approximately.\r\n\r\nShe has a stall at the markets of CREA and Paradise, where she sells her chickens whole and by the pound.  She sells them for $1.25 USD per pound, and if it\u2019s a different type of chicken (yellow Cuban) they cost $1.50 USD per pound.\r\n\r\nHer life\u2019s goal is to have her own home and live independently, and to continue managing her own business given that, these days, everyone must contribute equally. \r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

His dream is to meet the needs of his customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Jung, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":363506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-08-05T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.53},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.53},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.54,"local_amount":1230.77,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1256.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87036025,"comment":null},{"amount":61.54,"local_amount":1230.77,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1256.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948419,"comment":null},{"amount":71.53,"local_amount":1430.57,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790381,"comment":null},{"amount":63.46,"local_amount":1269.16,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680998,"comment":null},{"amount":61.1,"local_amount":1221.98,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1247.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075536,"comment":null},{"amount":50.06,"local_amount":1001.37,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911562,"comment":null},{"amount":61.54,"local_amount":1230.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1256.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947409,"comment":null},{"amount":61.54,"local_amount":1230.77,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1256.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675691,"comment":null},{"amount":66.81,"local_amount":1336.27,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1364.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710085,"comment":null},{"amount":240.88,"local_amount":4817.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4917.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045495,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T19:59:14Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126786,"name":"Luisa Diliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luisa Diliana M. tiene 37 a\u00f1os.

Their adult son was already living in South Florida and had started a business.  He employed his father and the two of them took care of the household expenses and Maria\u2019s bills.  \r\n\r\nDespite their support, Maria wanted to contribute to the household finances and keep herself busy. She was always been good at sewing. Two years ago, little by little, she started to develop a small client\u00e8le that used her services for clothing alterations. She was proud of her small business, but her sewing machine started to fail due to overuse.  \r\n\r\nMaria learned about ACCION USA\u2019s lending program and applied for a loan to buy two new sewing machines.  With this loan, Maria was able to invest in her business, and also establish a credit history. She paid her loan off perfectly and would now like a larger loan to make additional investments in her business.  \r\n\r\nA local factory wants to contract for her services, which would proviD. her with consistent work. Another business owner, who currently imports bathing suits, wants Maria to hand-make the swimwear for them. In order to sign these contracts, Maria would need an embroidery machine and a digital sewing machine to create her own designs. She will also need to purchase more inventory to maintain a more sizeable stock. For example, now, if she doesn't have the right color zipper, she has to take the bus downtown, incurring a $4 round-trip fare and more than 2 hours of her time.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Maria works in her quaint, one-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach. She hopes to be able to expand her business so she can rent a modest storefront where her customers can stop by and drop off items that need to be mended.  \r\n\r\nShe is a very friendly person who always has a smile on her face. She loves to visit with people and to get to know her regular customers. In her own space, she can welcome clients and, hopefully, hire a helper,

Agustina previously raised chickens,but decided to change businesses, and so far this has been going very well.  Some days she sells everything she can produce.

She says she learned to cook by guessing, as no one every formally taught her.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra.

Her sales have dropped recently, and she is considering changing her business sometime in the near future.  Her husband is also a cabinet-maker, and she would like run a carpentry business with him.

She and her husband have a bakery located in the center of the city of Jipijapa in the province of Manab\u00ed, and they start working very early in the morning, at 3:00 am.\r\n\r\nEveryday, they start baking 400 loaves of salty and sweet bread. Once the bread is out of the oven at 5:00 am, her husband begins delivering bread to the houses of their clients to fill their orders. Without a doubt, this is work that requires a lot of dedication because their goal is to sell all of the bread that is produced that day. What is not sold during the day is shared with their family because one of the rules for these bakeries is that the next day, the flour must the fresh. They have never sold day-old bread, since doing this would harm their business.\r\n\r\nMartha thinks that in the four years that they have had this business, their family has gotten many benefits, because they have been able to work together as a family. She also said that with their work, they have been able to offer an education to their children. Now, she wants to continue implementing her bakery and invest the money from the loan on raw materials, such as butter, flour, and sugar, among other necessary products.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":363521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy butter, flour and sugar to make bread ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":340.06,"local_amount":332.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":340.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035133,"comment":null},{"amount":340.7,"local_amount":333.13,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":340.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947389,"comment":null},{"amount":106.74,"local_amount":104.37,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":106.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789233,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-01T16:33:14Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126794,"name":"Astromelia Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Astromelia es socia del Banco Comunal Rocafuerte, un grupo de 21 mujeres que residen en el pueblo de Rocafuerte, aproximadamente media hora de la ciudad de Portoviejo.

She works in Jipijapa and also in Guayaquil; she works as a seamstress for a plastics factory in Guayaquil and makes clothes for dolls. She can do the work wherever she likes, so she generally works from her house in Jipijapa, where she has several sewing machines. She travels to Guayaquil to deliver her work. She has been doing this for 18 years and she says she loves to sew. She also does work by request, mostly suits and dresses for women. She sells cheese in the following way: she buys around 50 to 70 pounds of cheese at once, at $1.30 per pound, and then divides it into one-pound packages which she re-sells at $1.80. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise, especially household items such as sheets by the dozen.

She is glad she came back to the communal bank and she plans to remain a member for a long time. She has never had serious problems in repaying her debts; a few times she has gotten a little behind, but she always pays 100% of her loan by the end of the loan cycle. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":363518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"For the purchase of more merchandise, especially household items, such as sheets by the dozen.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Nancy Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1045,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":130.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":261.26,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":262.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035137,"comment":null},{"amount":131.26,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":131.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035138,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":131.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947393,"comment":null},{"amount":131.26,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":131.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947394,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":131.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789240,"comment":null},{"amount":131.26,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":131.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789241,"comment":null},{"amount":131.21,"local_amount":130.59,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":131.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-03T07:13:56Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126797,"name":"Flor Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Flor Maria tiene 47 a\u00f1os, es casada, y tiene 3 hijos y 2 nietos.

Since she married her husband, Tito, her consciousness has been raised about her productive role, aside from her reproductive role. Their only income was what her husband earned as a mechanic, an income that was not enough to cover the family's daily expenses, especially higher education for the children.\r\n\r\nThus, she made a decision for herself and it was supported by her husband. She became a member of ASHI in 2007 to take a loan to start her own business -- a business that is very familiar to her and that she had grown up with -- a rice planting and production business. \r\n\r\nMany people in Josie's village own farmland through inheritance. However, for many reasons, these people do not to use the land for farming. Others have no farming expertise and would rather convert agricultural land to commercial purposes and build commercial buildings. Sometimes, people don't have enough money to finance ah agricultural business. \r\n\r\nJosie had a loan from ASHI to finance the business, but she doesn't have land of her own. To pursue her business, she rented land to plant rice. After receiving and repaying two loans from ASHI, Josie is now qualified for a larger loan amount. She plans to use the loans to enlarge her rice field until she can buy her own

O. is the wife of a fisherman. The two have three children ranging in age from eight to three years old. Anabelle is 32 years old and lives with her family in a distant village in the province of Antique surrounded by the sea and mountains. \r\n\r\nPeople in their village do not go to market very often, because they try to avoid spending too much on transportation. Instead, people put up mini variety stores that sell basic necessities to fellow villagers. Each one tries to offer convenience to each family in their village. \r\n\r\nAnnabelle has her own business. She cooks and sells noodle soup. She also sells fish that her husband catches from the ocean. Since she started her business in 2006, she realized that food is the most salable product in their village. When she joined ASHI in 2007, she used the loan she received to finance the business she had started. Because she had demonstrated to ASHI her good performance in repayment, attendance and business, she qualifies for larger loans. Now she wants to buy her husband a fishing boat of his own to catch more fish so she can sell more fish. \r\n\r\nAnnabelle wishes that, someday, she can purchase more fishing boats to have more fish to sell throughout the municipality, not just in their village. She wishes that she can give her children a good life, bring out her children of poverty, and send them to college.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muminadjon is involved in sewing women's traditional and European-style clothing.  Muminadjon has many customers.  She sews very beautifully and, thus, has many orders.  Usually, when she receives orders for dresses, she picks the fabric herself.  She buys accessories on her own as well.  Muminadjon has very good taste, and many clients rely on her taste.  For the autumn season, she decided to purchase wool fabric for sewing European clothing and velour fabric for sewing traditional clothing.  She is requesting a loan for this purpose and hopes that this loan will help with developing her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":363718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of wool and velour fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kairakkum","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muminadjon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126855,"name":"Choun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Choun S., age 29, and her husband, Mr. Vanny Pang, 25, live along National Road Number One about 15 kilometers from Phnom Penh City.

He is married and is a father of 4 children.  His wife is not employed.  She stays at home, does domestic work and feeds livestock.  Abdusamad is involved in raising and selling livestock.

Livestock eats mountain grass, and Abdusamad saves on the feed.  With the onset of autumn, Abdusamad sells some of the grown livestock, but does not buy any new livestock.

He is married and is a father of 3 children.  His wife is not employed.  She stays at home, does domestic work and feeds livestock.  Abdurashit is involved in raising and selling livestock.  Beginning of summer for Abdurashit is the season to purchase livestock because livestock and feed are cheap during the summer.  And he does not have to spend much on the feed either because livestock eats mountain grass; thus, Abdurashit saves on animal feed.  With the onset of winter, Abdurashit sells some of the grown livestock, but does not buy any new livestock.

With this loan, she hopes to further expand her business and use the profits for the benefit of her family.  Currently, Lucila is expanding her home, but the addition lacks a roof and floor.

Olinda is seen in this photo with the small amount of merchandise she had left after a month of good sales.  Olinda makes a living selling shoes made in the northern part of Peru. She lives in the city of Pucallpa, and travels from time to time to the coastal city of Trujillo to purchase her footwear.\r\n\r\nOlinda is married and has four adult children. Her husband works as a laborer at Pucallpa's port. (Pucallpa lies along the Ucayali, a wide brown river that flows past the city and eventually joins the Amazon to the north).\r\n\r\nOlinda has worked with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about one year and belongs to a communal bank known as Las Guerreras (The Warriors). Olinda invested her first loan of about $100 in clothing she could sell.  This is how she began to develop as an independent businesswoman.  Olinda plans to invest this new loan in women's shoes.  She is grateful to Manuela Ramos for helping her develop her business, and is careful to request only loan amounts that she is confident she will be able to pay back on time.  Olinda is also happy to be receiving credit from Manuela Ramos, because the organization provides loans easily, quickly and with few complications, unlike many other banks.\r\n\r\nOlinda's goal is to continue to grow her business. She eventually hopes to have a small store from which she can sell her line of women's shoes.

Silvia's husband is an IT specialist and also sells computers and computer parts to customers who place orders with him. Silvia and her husband have a 12-year-old son.\r\n\r\nSilvia has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about two years and belongs to the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (\u201cNew Friends\u201d). She used her first loan of 300 soles to invest in a small grocery shop and in sewing materials.

Zoila has been working as a seamstress since she was 15.  She is now 63 years old.  Zoila is widowed and has five adult children.  She is currently caring for her two-year-old granddaughter Jimena.\r\n\r\nZoila has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for 2.5 years and is a member of the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  Zoila used her very first loan of 300 soles to invest in sewing materials and in the sale of cooked foods.  She will use this loan of 1000 soles for the same purpose: Zoila plans to buy fabrics and other materials for sewing and also basic food products for her other business, preparing and selling cooked food from her home in the evenings.  \r\n\r\nZoila's goal is to leave an excellent sewing workshop to her daughters Doris and Fiorella when she passes on.  Zoila is grateful to Manuela Ramos not only for the financial support but also for the educational sessions given by the organization's loan officers at her communal bank's monthly meetings.  Zoila feels that these sessions help her to learn a little more than what experience alone can teach her.

As a mother she has tried to strengthen herself in order to help her children in their various professions so that she won\u2019t feel like a burden at home as her children live with their own families. Since she doesn\u2019t have the strength needed to do her work with normalcy, she had the idea of renting some rooms as her house is very big. Living alone was something very sad and now she can share her home with her renters, who provide company for her. This is why Mary works to provide better living conditions for her renters, who are happy to live in her home as she treats them with much love and patience, and are timely with their rent payments.

He lives with his brother and shares activities with him. Together they looked for opportunities outside of their birthplace. As of this date, they have obtained their own home, which took quite a bit of effort. Since Angel has finished his secondary studies, he has been interested in having his own business. Economic conditions had not allowed him to begin this business. To achieve his goals, he had to work at different sales jobs in the crowded markets of the city. After several years he obtained the capital that he needed and with his brother they purchased a booth where they sell clothes in the most popular market in the city. The large crowds in this market help their business. Never the less, the customers are very particular. The brothers have to provide a variety of clothing They also must provide the latest styles for men and women. It is in this manner that they work from eight in the morning until eleven at night. During this time they try to provide their customers with the best service in order to insure that they return. Now their next goal is to acquire another booth in order increase their sales.

Compared to other food vendors, she tries to offer her customers quality dishes that appeal to their tastes.  So far, she has been able to meet those expectations.

She enjoys doing the business and tries her best to improve it into progress.  \r\nWith the opportunity brought by Kiva lenders, Violeta was encouraged to apply for a PHP12,000 loan that will be used as additional capital for her vending business. This way, she would then able to support those small vegetable farmers in their village by catering their fruit and vegetable products to sell in the market and to sell to some buyers also. She hopes that Kiva lenders will put an eye to her business concerns and ambitions not only for herself but also for her fellow men.

Ara-al, La Castellana, Negros Occidental, who is married with two school-age children and earns a living by operating a convenience store.\n\nWhen Elizabeth started her business, she just sold coffee and snacks to her neighbors. She then expanded it into a \"carinderia\" - a small eatery that sold cooked food to her neighbors. After she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 she used her loans to improve her business, expanding her operations to sell groceries and other goods that her neighbors might need - almost like a 7\/11 store.\n\nElizabeth also used the loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to improve the construction of her store which was originally built from bamboo and other light materials. She slowly reinforced the building using hollow blocks and cement for a more permanent structure. The income from her business enables her to continue fixing and improving her house as well as pay for the education of her two young children.\n\nNow on her 15th loan, Elizabeth is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she can restock her convenience store and have more working capital to use in her eatery business.\n\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nShe dropped out of her 5th year of primary schooling (education system in Mali) in order to help her mother, who used to sell condiments.\u00a0 After several years of apprenticeship with her, Fatoumata enjoys a great deal of experience in the commerce of various goods, especially firewood and charcoal, which she has been selling for four years.\u00a0 Being the only seller of firewood in her district, she is in high demand.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying her customers, who grow in number from day to day, she decided to turn toward Soro Yiriwaso 30 months ago.\u00a0 After three solidarity loans and an individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.\u00a0 She intends to use it to buy six truck loads of firewood.\u00a0 She stocks up in the village of K\u00e9l\u00e9kou from rural suppliers possessing a permit to cut, issued by the competent authorities.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nFatoumata sells to customers composed mostly of women, cash or credit accepted.\u00a0 Among her customers are also a few men, who are roast cooks.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThus, with this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA, which will enable her to repay her debts, to help her husband cover family expenses, and to provide for herself without any

R. of Prk. Duensitin, La Castellana, is 60 years old and married with five adult children.\n\nFor the past thirty-seven years she has owned and operated a general store that sells a variety of food products and other goods to the local community. Before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, her store was very small, constructed with bamboo and light materials, and it barely provided for her needs. After she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she was able to expand her business and the income she earned also helped a lot in helping her afford the education of her children, all of whom were able to finish school.\n\nNow that all of her children are either gainfully employed or have their own sources of income, Nilda invested her profits and loans in other business activities - she bought a motorcycle and a multi-cab van that gives her a wider distribution range for her products.\n\nFor her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nilda is borrowing PHP 25,000 which she to fund the expanding business activities of her general store.\n\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":364331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Pheap B. lives in Doem Pour village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a plot of land on which she cultivates rice to earn a living.\r\n\r\nIn this plantation, she has some problems because her field is infertile and has a lot of insects causing damage to the crop. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to purchase fertilizer and pesticides.

They live in the town of Chiola, in the prefecture of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of Mali).\r\n<p>\r\nWith the goal of having agricultural fertilizers at their disposal and to be able to recruit men to plow and weed during the beginning of the rainy season, they joined the group Soro Yiriwaso. They are on their first farm loan, having already fully repaid 3 group loans.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase 8 sacks of fertilizer, 1,400 kilograms of seeds for millet and peanuts, recruit agricultural workers for the plowing and the weeding. They resupply themselves with seeds and fertilizers in the weekly markets in S\u00e9gou (the big market) and Konodimini.  \r\n<p>\r\nOn an area of 21 hectares, they hope to produce an average of 5 tons of peanuts, 4 tons of millet, 2.4 tons of beans and the tops of the beans (the leaves of the bean plant) will be made into bundles. They will consume part of the harvest and the other half is intended for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nThe profits will be used to purchase food at the weekly markers and healthcare for their children \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Margot Bonner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":364355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds, fertilizer, and pay for the wages of people to plow and weed.

of the old districts of the city of Bougouni (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nBorn in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, Lassana was compelled to interrupt his schooling after political events occurring in this country almost seven years ago.\u00a0 Once back in his ancestral country, he decided to become familiarized with commerce with the help of his uncle, who owns several hardware stores.\u00a0 With five years of experience, Lassana has a good command of his business and is in high demand.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn his search for supplemental financial resources, he joined the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which he is now on his first individual loan.\u00a0 With this loan, he intends to buy electronics for his general store that sells a bit of everything, sound equipment, hardware, lubricants, etc.\u00a0 He stocks up in Bamako (capital of Mali) from wholesalers, and he sells retail, cash or credit accepted, to customers of all walks of life.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Lassana plans on realizing a monthly profit of 75,000 francs CFA that will serve to round out his working capital.\u00a0 His ambition is to expand his store.\r\n<br

Traor\u00e9, age 39, is a father with one child.\u00a0 He lives with his wife and child in his parents' place within a traditional extended family in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord district of the city of Bougouni (region of Sikasso).\u00a0 He dropped out of his 7th year of primary school (educational system of Mali) in order to follow after his father, who is a driver, with the idea of becoming a driver himself.\u00a0 For year, he was an apprentice driver until he obtained his driver's permit eight years ago.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAfter being a driver for an individual (that is, a third party) for years, he decided to leave this trade (which wasn't bringing in enough income) in order to run a business buying and selling fuels and lubricants in the Massabla Coura district.\u00a0 He learned about this work from one of his childhood friends.\u00a0 With three years of experience, Mamadou is mastering his business.\r\n\r\nTo bolster his business, he decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first individual loan.\u00a0 He intends to buy gasoline and motor oil in quantity from wholesalers in Bamako (capital of Mali).\u00a0 Accepting cash but rarely credit, he sells retail to customers who are generally motorcyclists.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans on realizing a monthly profit of 32,500 francs CFA.\u00a0 In the years ahead, he envisions diversifying his sales by including tire repair supplies.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

capital for her duck-raising business. Even though she is single, Jocelyn has familial responsibilities, as she is helping in the support of her nephews. So her duck-raising business has been a big help to her family unit. The income that it generates is supporting their daily needs, especially in buying the basic necessities like rice, clothes and paying for the education of her wards.\r\n\r\nJocelyn\u2019s new loan of PHP 25,000 will again fund her duck-raising business. It will be used to buy ducklings, to repair the cages and pens, and to buy feeds.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is thankful that she has access to loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon because it allows her to continue her business and support her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.
