Most of its members are new, and live in the same neighborhood. They are very enthusiastic to work hard and take advantage of the opportunity offered to them in this loan cycle. There are about 5 returning group members who are taking out new loans. Some group members sell cosmetic products (Yanbal, Esika and Avon brands), one is a laundress, and others sell drinks and\/or food (lunch or dinner). There is a lot of competition in these fields, since every day more and more people are taking up informal commerce, but each group member makes a notable effort to pay off each loan installment on time. The group members will invest their loans in a variety of different things: those who sell cosmetics will use the money to fill their personal orders; one client will buy plastic tables and chairs for her small restaurant, and most of the remaining clients will invest the money in their respective businesses and jobs in order increase revenue. The returning group members have previous experience at other similar financial institutions, while others are taking out a group loan for the first time. Returning clients have been invited back due to their demonstrated commitment to paying off their loan installments on time and complying with Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital's standards.\n<br

In their second term, they are already showing responsibility and eagerness to get ahead with effort and dedication to their work. Each has economic activities such as selling bread, empanadas, clothes in the market, cosmetics and catalog products. Generally, they carry out their work as street vendors. Others make their living selling gas and with different services such as public passenger transportation, making clothing, and working in different offices in the role of secretary. Their competence depends a lot on the type of product they offer. For example, those that sell bread have a higher demand than those that sell clothes, but since it's a close group they all support each other. The loan is destined for the purchase of new merchandise, ingredients, tools, and replacement parts. For some it's for the repair and improvement of their homes which will help to better their families' quality of life.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

","en":"The \u201cDivine Jesus\u201d cooperative bank is represented by Ms. Marioly and is comprised of 15 members.  They are entering into a second loan cycle of demonstrating their responsibility and punctuality with payments.  Each one of the members has their own business selling bread, clothes, making and selling handicrafts, and vegetables.  Some also sell empanadas, clothes, proviD. transportation services, operate heavy machinery and proviD. in-home laundering services.  \r\n\r\nCompetition is high within the business arena, however the members know how to get ahead with their businesses to save their capital and profits in order to support their families.  The loan would be destined to help them increase their merchandise for the Christmas holiday season, when their products are in higher demand.  They need capital to buy raw materials, supplies, and merchandise.  This will help them increase their sales and, ultimately, their incomes.\r\n\r\nIn a previous loan cycle, they had problems with a few members that misspent their funds and didn\u2019t know how to manage their money.  This led to some loan payment troubles.  Those members that did not work well with the team have been removed, and the remaining participants are enthusiastic about continuing to work hard to grow their businesses and improve the quality of life for their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

Agust\u00edn has a brick house, but only has the benefit of an electricity supply.  A year ago, he started to sell bottles of water and coca-cola, and, thereafter, began selling vegetables.  This proved to be successful as such were previously unavailable in his neighbourhood.  Agust\u00edn goes to the wholesale market at 5:30am twice a week to buy vegetables, coca-cola and rice.  It is somewhat difficult for Agust\u00edn to go to the wholesale market because he has to go by bus with 1 or 2 sacks of rice.  His wife sells DVDs in the centre of Para\u00edso de Guayaquil and this helps towards the family\u2019s expenses as they have two children, one six years old who studies in a private school that costs $2.5 monthly, and the other is four years old and does not go to school.     \r\nWith this loan, Agust\u00edn wants to buy more sugar, oil and vegetables to expand his product range.  In the future, he wants to be able to increase his stock and buy a freezer so that he can also sell meat and ensure the future wellbeing of his family.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":444585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"SUGAR, OIL, VEGETABLES","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-10T16:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":69.76},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":70.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":74.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":77.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.69},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.76,"local_amount":69.76,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":69.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679526,"comment":null},{"amount":70.06,"local_amount":70.06,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":70.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074040,"comment":null},{"amount":71.84,"local_amount":71.84,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":71.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910007,"comment":null},{"amount":74.62,"local_amount":74.62,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":74.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945572,"comment":null},{"amount":75.57,"local_amount":75.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673935,"comment":null},{"amount":77.69,"local_amount":77.69,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":77.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708099,"comment":null},{"amount":79.47,"local_amount":79.47,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":79.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891307,"comment":null},{"amount":80.99,"local_amount":80.99,"processed_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":80.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631578,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-12T03:58:51Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":160465,"name":"Petronilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el sr.

The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

She is 42 years old and has 4 children: Noem\u00ed-21, Jivan-18, Soledad-15, and Luis-13. They all share a little house in the Peruvian jungle.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe makes a living farming plantain, avocado, coffee, and citrus fruits on her own land.  She also earns money working with her husband as a laborer on others' land.  Although it is not much, it helps them with the expenses of the home.  Nevertheless, little by little they are working on building two homes on the land close to their farmland.  \r\n<p>\r\nLucy decided to do farmwork for other people a year ago because it is a good opportunity to work and earn extra money, and she can also count on her older children's support in tending to their farmland.  Every day, this hardworking woman gets up at first light and works as a day laborer until the afternoon, and then checks on her children's work in their fields and is very tired at the end of the day, but with a lot of faith that someday all her dreams will come true.  \r\n<p>\r\n Becuase Lucy is such a hardworking and punctual woman, this is her fourth loan with MFP.

With that as her motive, every day she gets up very early to work with much dedication.

The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

is 32 and has 4 children.  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting peanuts for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Amu needs a loan of WST $2000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to financially support extended members of her family.  Amu also works at her family's plantation and vegetable garden.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Amu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Amu's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nSPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAmu's Overall Social Metric Score:  1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education: 2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income: 1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets: 2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 25 and single with no children.  She works in her mother's business, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Tausala needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tausala joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Tausala's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nSPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nTausala's Overall Social Metric Score*:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 29 and married with 3 children (ages 6-month - 6 years old).  She owns & operates a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Tauavae  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make pancakes and german buns for sA..  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tauavae  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Tauavae 's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nTauavae's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.8 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 52 and married with 6 children (ages 8 - 23).  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has  years of experience in this business.    Luluofe needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luluofe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Luluofe's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nLuluofe's Overall Social Metric Score:               1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 54 and married with 7 children (ages 6 - 24).  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has  years of experience in this business.    Sosefina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sosefina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Sosefina's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nSosefina's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nAlfreda is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She owns & operates a business venture, catching & selling farm-raised fish .  She has 4 years of experience in this business.    Foai needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Foai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Foai's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nFoai's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Remequita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Remequita is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Remequita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<P>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Boldmaa is 37 years old and lives with her husband and two sons in a house in  Bayanhongor province, Mongolia. Her older son is a university student, her younger is in high school and her husband works as a taxi driver. Boldmaa operates a small hair salon in her town. She opened her business in 1997 in partnership with a close friend. She and her friend, who is also a hairdresser, started their business out of a small rented workspace. <P>\r\n\r\nOver the years, Boldmaa has grown her business into a successful and stable operation. In 2005, she used her savings to buy her own workplace. At this time she also gave her salon a name, \"HANA\". She has continued her success since 2005 and has since hired four more hairdressers to keep up with demand. <P>\r\n\r\nBoldmaa works hard to provide quality service to her many customers and hopes to continue her success in the future. She is requesting a 2,245,000 tugrug (~1580 USD) loan to purchase styling equipment and supplies for her salon.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank<P>\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

She owns & operates a business venture, selling fine mats to tourists and local community members.  Fine mats are special in Samoan culture--they are not used to sit upon but to exchange as keepsakes for special occasions or future falavelave (family obligations such as funerals, weddings, etc.).  Tulusefulutasi has 3 years of experience in this business.    Tolusefulutasi needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase raw materials to make mats & mattresses.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Tolusefulutasi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Tolusefulutasi's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nTolusefulutasi's Overall Social Metric Score:               1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 49 and married with 5 children (ages 6-28).  She owns & operates a business venture, selling fine mats to tourists and local community members.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Laitalie needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase paint and feathers to decorate her mats.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  Laitalie has had a previous loan on Kiva.  You can see her business profile and subsequent journal update at:  \r\nhttp:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=68474\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Laitalie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Laitalie's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nLaitalie's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates

is 51 and married with 7 children (ages 15-30).  She owns & operates a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  She has 5 years of experience in this business.    Viena needs a loan of WST $2000 to invest in renovating the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Viena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Viena's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

M. is 27 years old. He lives in Col\u00f3n, in the department of La Libertad. He lives with his wife and their three children, a six-year old and twins that are barely a year old. Jorge has a microbus business (the name that small busses are called in his country), in which he brings people to offices and different workplaces. Jorge depends solely on this work to support his family, for which he requests a loan so that he can pay for the necessary repairs for the microbus and also bring it in for a tune-up. In this way, he can offer better service to his customers so that they can travel in a more secure manner. Also, he feels very fortunate to have his own means of transport that allows him to obtain earnings necessary for his family\u2019s sustenance. For this reason, Jorge feels it very important to care for the source of his work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva

F. is 61 and divorced with 4 children (ages 27 - 38).  She owns & operates a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Leaso F. needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 160 talas or US $67 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leaso F. joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Leaso F.'s 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nLeaso's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

T. is from the village of Primicias Mapandan, Pangasinan. She is 42 years old. Rowena is married and has one child in school. To make a living, Rowena owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from vending of vegetables through a rolling store. Rowena has been running this business for over 1 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rowena joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rowena has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Rowena is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rowena from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

C. is from the town of Carosucan Sta Barbara, Pangasinan.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 35,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<P>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly comprised of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is 53 years old and her husband, Reynaldo, works as a carpenter. For the past twenty years the couple have tried very hard to have a child but they have not been blessed by one. They live in the village of Barangay Bilan, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nNeonita wants only to continue her business and live a simple life. Even though she has no children to care for and prepare for their education, Neonita wants to make their living more comfortable and to save a portion of their income for their future. This triggered Neonita to open a general store. The small business is adjacent to their house where she earns a small amount because she only sells important goods for households until such time as she is able to expand her business which will benefit her.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Neonita became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon and was able to get a loan for her general store. From the loan and business income, her general store is maximized and has contributed tremendously to the family. As her loans continue, her business improves and now earns a minimum of Php 10,000 per month which she uses for their expenses but saves most of it for her future.\r\n\r\nNeonita's previous loan of Php 15,000 was utilized for her general store and it was fully repaid in full and on-time without delay. Now on her 14th loan, she is borrowing the same amount of Php 15,000 as an additional working capital for her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

G. lives in the village of Sitio Nasug-ong, Brgy Caradio-an, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She is 64 years old, married to Jorge, and has three adult children. She wants only to continue improving the living conditions of her family through her business and be able to save a portion of her income for the future.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Sonia already owned a small business that helped in sustaining their family needs and increased the income of the family, especially for their children who were in school. Her business continued and earned, but Sonia wanted to sell additional products in her store for additional income. That's why, in 1995, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon: to have an additional capital for her general store. She was very thankful for the loans because it contributed more income for her family. From that income, she was able to renovate their house and was able to build a concrete toilet. As her loans got bigger, the business grew and earned a minimum monthly income of 5,000 PHP. This income was used for her household needs and she saved some of it for her future.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 25,000 PHP was used as an additional working capital for her general store, where she bought different kinds of new products to sell. The loan was paid on a weekly basis, on time, and was fully paid within her loan term with any delay. She maintained her good record with NWTF-PD. Her present loan is for the same amount of 25,000 PHP, which she will use for her general store as an additional working capital.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has  earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":443798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Purita Tanulo, Brgy Pilar, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is 44 years old. Her husband, Ricardo, operates their motorboat for fishing and also helps her in running an oyster and crabs business. They have four children ranging in age from 4 to 24 years old. Alicia wants her children to finish their studies and get good jobs, to help her husband for additional income, and hopes that their businesses will continue to bring more blessings to the family.\r\n\r\nWhen Alicia was still single, she would help her parents in running the business of oyster breeding until such time when her parents gave her a portion of their oyster breeding business for her to manage. She managed it well and was able to contribute income to her family. When she got married, she continued her business and her husband invested in the oyster business for expansion. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Alicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have an additional capital for her business. To expand, she needed bamboo, nets, rope and other materials for good results and better income. As the loan continued, she was able to buy a motorized boat for fishing, which was used in catching crabs. In their business she was able to earn a minimum of 10,000 PHP per month. This income was utilized for the education of their children and some were used to defray family expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia's previous loan of 19,500 PHP was fully utilized for her oyster breeding and the amount was fully paid on time without any delay. Now on her eighth cycle loan, the same amount of 19,500 PHP will be used for fishing and oyster breeding.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Let\u2019s support this loving and hard-working mother.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gulsara is 56 years old. She is married and the mother of 5 children. Gulsara owns a clothing business at the local market in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She has been doing this business for about 5 years. Her business has benefited from a good sales location and constant demand for her products.\r\n\r\nGulsara tries to offer good prices to her customers while still making a profit. She has requested a loan of $1,500 USD to increase her product inventory. This is a busy time for many market vendors as the cold season is coming and everyone is preparing for the winter season. By purchasing additional inventory, Gulsara will be better prepared to meet increased demand and earn a good income. We believe her perseverance and natural liveliness will help her continue to succeed in her trade and repay this loan on time.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has been a member of the U-IMCEC fund (one of Kiva's field partners) since January 2004. She has good experience in managing loans, as she has already repaid 5 previous loans. She is married and has one child who is 28 years old. Her husband earns a salary, but the couple have five other people in her care. This is the reason why she entered the business and dressmaking fields, in order to bring some support in providing for the family.\r\nHer main business is selling breakfast meals at a school located not far from her home. At the same time, Ms. Nar S. is a dressmaker and has profited from certain events to develop her business to include the sale of manufactured fabric, an activity she inherited from her parents, who were almost all tailors. Thus, she is seeking a loan of 250,000 frs to buy foodstuffs to stock for the preparation of her breakfast meals, to buy fabric to make boubous (flowing West African robes) for sale during Tabaski, and also to buy karit\u00e9 (shea butter). Karit\u00e9 is a product easily sold during the cold season, insofar as the Ms. S.'s constant concern is to diversify her business. She is enthusiastic about her commercial experience. It is by saving that she has been able to save up and buy a refrigerator, which has allowed her to go into selling ice cream and juice, all within the framework of diversifying her products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":445157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase her working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T01:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168474,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007427,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036493,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759051,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790565,"comment":null},{"amount":59.8,"local_amount":26000,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":26625.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971004,"comment":null},{"amount":55.2,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":24576.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708271,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922343,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188850,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25601.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484300,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T17:37:03Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":160689,"name":"Fania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fania J. is currently in the business of selling tea and bread in a restaurant and is requesting a loan to purchase plastic tables and chairs in order to seat more customers.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Suzith has been engaged in his business for over one year and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Suzith joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Suzith is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Suzith from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

38, lives in Bekaa with his wife and their child. Mohammad has been working as a taxi driver since 1999. He requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to do some maintenance work on his car. This is the first time that Mohammad has requested a loan.

He moved to Dakar in 1999, with the goal of finding a job, earning a living, and helping his family. Thus, through a friend, he became an employee of a security agency named Raam Daan, which ensures the security of the holdings of U-IMCEC (one of Kiva's field partners) in Dakar. He is about forty years old and lives in Grand Yoff, a suburb of Dakar. He is married and is the father of one child, aged 5. His monthly salary is insufficient and does not allow him to resolve some social needs or to start up certain projects. It is for this reason that he is seeking a loan of 200,000 frs. The aim of this loan is to buy cement to make bricks that will allow him to construct a 3-room building to improve the living conditions of his mother and his small family, since they live in straw

She is 59 years old and the mother of three adult children.  Juana sells clothing and beauty supplies to her customers for cash and credit.  She has been part of the communal bank, \u201cLas Libertadoras\u201d for the past eight years and is part of the \" Manuela Ramos\" movement (an organization in Peru that works to improve opportunities for women), which has allowed her to generate income so that she could help her husband pay for their children's educations.  Her first loan was for 300 PEN (~$100) which she invested in beauty supplies.  Now she is requesting a loan of 2100 PEN ($750) which she will invest in clothing for resale.

Their previous loans were all repaid in full without difficulty. Their business is the sale of plastic cups, sounbala, charcoal, wood, etc. With their new loan they plan to purchase five dozen plastic cups, four 100kg bags of nere seeds and twenty five bags of charcoal. They get their supplies from neighbouring villages and from the city of Kadiolo. They sell their products in the Kaboila market and door-to-door to a clientele made up of both men and women. They accept cash or credit. Their goal is for each of them to earn a monthly income of 37.500 FCFA with a portion of the income going to savings and to meet the needs of their families and another portion to be re-invested in their business.

The majority of the members asked for the loan to buy or increase their seasonal merchandise, since Christmastime is very profitable.  Their future hope for their businesses is to see them more consolidated, in terms of capital, in order to not have to ask for loans.

The majority of the members make a living selling clothes and other items (T-shirts, pants for men, women and children; towels, bedspreads). Their area is known for its busy economic activity since it is on the main highway, and the members take advantage with their sales. Because of the economic activity there is  enormous business potential and the amount of competition is average, but with the growth in population in the area there will be a growth in demand. The market is not fully utilized, and in a small space a lot of different types of businesses can be found. This loan will be directly used to invest in all the merchandise the members bring in from the main cities, and thus they will be able to grow their businesses.

All the members live in the same neighborhood and have different businesses. Their meetings take place at the home of Yolanda, who has belonged to the group since its inception and is its oldest member, so you could call her the founder. The members' businesses are diverse. For example, Martha, the group's president, sells food out of her home and also on the street. Encarnaci\u00f3n sells jewelry. Elia sells meals (chicken and other regional dishes), refreshments and other types of food, and also sells clothing. The members say there is a high level of competition for their businesses, but they work with Kiva partner AgroCapital transparently and it gives them a lot of advantages and access to credit. The loan will be used to raise capital and grow their businesses. The majority of the members have experience with the community bank, and their work with the previous loans went above the institution's requirements.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty

The members who have been with the group since the foundation are on their sixth cycle. The majority of the members sell cosmetics, while two sell sweets and breads, and others have small snack stands in the neighborhood. There is regular competition in respect to the sale of food, and although the members say that cosmetic sales are strong, they are not the only ones and  have to work very hard to have enough product orders to make profits.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aggieagnes joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Aggieagnes's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAggieagnes's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates
