She knows that her income will not let her do all that she wants to do now, so most important for her is to cover the roof of the house as she has her sewing machine and tools in the house and that is where she attends to her clients.  She also needs a big sink so that she can keep more water as there is not much where she lives.  These are the reason why she needs a loan; so that she can meet these needs.

The majority run commercial enterprises from their own homes where they sell groceries or clothing or chupas (a chewy bread snack). They are all neighbours and are now in the third cycle of the women\u2019s program. Each person receives an average of G.600.000 of credit.<p>\r\n\r\nThe formation of the group was largely due to the efforts of Sra. Gasparina P. who invited her neighbours to participate. They soon became interested in the women\u2019s program and so began the first meetings. The group\u2019s objective currently is the activities associated with the San Juan festival where they plan to sell local dishes and use the money they earn to add to their own savings.<p>\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of the members of this group is the high level of observance of the rules that govern the program. This is demonstrated by the regular repayment of the loan and by punctual attendance at the weekly meetings. They are also very strict about members who miss meetings without good reason, and the guilty are given warnings.<p>\r\n\r\nGasparina notes that the success of an undertaking is due in large part to good organisation and discipline. For these reasons she is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya which, as well as helping the group raise capital, also provides an advisor to assist with training and the administrative tools necessary to run a group business.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer.<b\/><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Yaka Roysa de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9, gran parte de las se\u00f1oras se dedican a actividades comerciales que lo explotan en su mismo domicilio, como  despensas, chiperas, vendedoras de ropas, entre otras, todas son vecinas, actualmente y est\u00e1n en el 3 ciclo del programa comit\u00e9 de mujeres y reciben un promedio de G. 600.000 por persona en cr\u00e9dito.<p>\r\n\r\nLa  conformaci\u00f3n del grupo se debi\u00f3 a la gran colaboraci\u00f3n que brindo la se\u00f1ora Gasparina P., quien fue la que comenz\u00f3 inicialmente con las invitaciones a sus vecinas quienes r\u00e1pidamente mostraron inter\u00e9s por el programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres.

Abdunazar earns income providing taxi services with his car. He works from early morning till late night in order to keep his customers and to obtain new ones. Abdunazar has been involved in this business for the last five years, doing his best to provide high quality services at affordable prices. For this purpose, Abdunazar installed a gas-based fuel system in the taxi a while ago.

M. lives in the Rudaki area.  She sews Tadjik quilts.  She buys cotton wool and material, sews the quilts, and distributes the finished product.  This business requires additional investment since the price of cotton wool grows daily. Therefore, she has decided to buy all the materials necessary for her business and work with all of her might since it is time for her son to marry.  For this, Inobathon plans to take out a loan which she can pay off in 12 months.  Inobathon is married and has four children. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Melissa, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430

The income from the two daughters is US$2.60 each day, while her son typically makes US$3 each day of net income. This has been a difficult year for farmers in Cambodia, because weather patterns have not been as consistent and inflation has been high. Many families are seeking out loans to expand and diversify their sources of income. Son K. has asked for a loan of US$1000 to expand her son\u2019s fruit inventory. She sees his business as more profitable than her own and has set it as a higher priority. However, she would like to expand her own farmland in the future, and expand her cultivation.

He started out his business buing and selling small cattle and gradually began to buy and raise large livestock. <p>\r\nToday, he goes from district to district to buy cattle from one and sell to another. He uses part of the profits for his family's subsistance, and the other part he puts back into his business. <p>\r\nHe has been working with Microinvest for a year, and in this time, has proven himself to be punctual with his payments. Abdukavi has applied for a new loan to help him further expand his business. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from the Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva volunteer.

is 21 years old, not married. After graduating from school she has not worked anywhere and stayed at home because there were not positions open anywhere where she could work. To have some kind of additional income Shahnoza has been drying fresh apricots during the season for the past three years. The technology is simple and does not require any hard labor. In the early mornings the apricots are collected into boxes and after being burned in sulfur are lied on the sun to dry. After a couple of days the seeds are taken out and the fruit is dried more. The ready made dry apricots are then collected into sacks and then sold closer to autumn when the price for them is higher. The profits from this business helps support the family. This year Shahnoza decided to get a loan to buy more apricots.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0428\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0435 21

For the past 8 years, she sold foodstuffs, especially corn. In view of the evolution of her business, she felt the need to take out a loan. At the beginning of 2008, her daughter Florence had some health problems that caused Mrs. H. to spend all her business capital to save her daughter's life. Despite this very unfortunate situation, she fully reimbursed her last loan. To get her business up and running again, she is again asking for a loan in the amount of US$ 250 to be used for a new project, namely selling cooked food which should be  more lucrative because of the current crisis in the food supply.<P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Dame H.

He is 43 years old, married and has four children. A year ago he has come to MicroInvest and got his first loan which helped him buy several calves. After the sale he used the profits and invested into business expansion. In addition he has also rented out a small space for manufacturing of confectioneries and hired several workers to produce them. He has not abandoned his cattle business though. At this time the prices for cattle are lower and Nizomiddin has decided to apply for another loan to further expand this business.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

has a specialized education in computer programming. After graduating from college he has decided to start his own business to provide computer services. When he started this business it was still a new niche. He bought several computers, a scanner, printer and other peripherals and rented out a space in the city center. He gave his business a related meaningful name - Imkon, which is translated from Tajik as possibilities. He has gradually added a few other services offered by his business such as recording of celebrations and events on video and an internet-cafe with access to the world wide web. Hairullo's services include the following: word processing and printing of documents, internet access, document lamination, making of invitation cards and much more. At this time Hairullo has created and will soon be launching his new project. He wants to start an advertising business which will include design and printing of ad banners. He has already ordered a 12 color plotter and has hired a specialist who will tune and get the plotter working properly. Hairullo has heard of Kiva and decided to apply for a loan to fulfill his financial needs.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

is 26 years old, married and lives with his parents. After graduating from the university three years ago he started his own business. He started out with renting out of a small kiosk where he provided services in cellular phone activation, sales of prepaid phone cards and printing of documents. By gradually increasing business cash flow he expanded his business. He bought another printer and scanner. He uses parts of the profits to support his family and the rest of it invests into his business. When he heard of Kiva, Maruf has decided to apply for a loan which he will use to buy wholesale SIM cards and prepaid phone cards.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

Elise K., a widow, was born around 1951 in Cotonou. She is the mother of four children of whom the oldest is deceased, leaving her responsible for three children. She lives in Xwlacodji, a suburb of Cotonou, and her business is the sale of seafood. Since her husband's death, she is the sole breadwinner for the family. Concerned about the future of her children, she realizes that she needs to add to her capital so as to increase her income and stop buying small quantities on credit, something the loan will permit her to remedy.  As a first loan she received the sum of US$ 45 on April 12, 2000 and was able to reimburse it without difficulty. As her business has evolved thanks to the loans, she is now requesting her 13th loan in the amount of US$ 775. <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Dame K.

She is a tailor and has a shop selling clothes made by her as well as those bought from Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. She has had the business for 9 years and now she has opened up a learning section where she has six girls as students whom she is teaching the same trade. All the girls are school drop-outs due to lack of school fees, and she has divided them into two sections; a day class of three students and an evening class of three students. This she does because of the lack of enough sewing machines to cater for all of them. Right now she is faced with a challenge that four more girls very badly want to join, and she hopes to at least buy two extra machines once given a loan. \r\n<p>\r\nHer dream, if she could get enough money, would be to buy as many machines as she wants because in Kasangati, her village, many children, especially girls, are dropping out of school due to poverty. Hence, some fathers favor boys over girls for education and most girls end up in early marriages. If one gets a chance, she learns tailoring, and this has saved so many from the deadly disease, AIDS. \r\n<p>\r\nThe biggest challenge Aisha is facing is all her students left school because of lack of school fees, yet they have to pay some small amount to study at her place. Getting this small amount of money out of them is a problem, and the only thing she can do is be patient with them to the extent that even one had to pay her after completing the course and starting to work for herself. It is determination and hard work that are driving Aisha. She is married with 3 children aged 12, 9, and 5. She needs a loan to buy another two sewing machines."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":175016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Aisha Namirimu needs a loan to buy two more sewing machines for her students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kasangati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.438056 32.586389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-08-04T23:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cissy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatumah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-19T20:32:53Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3200000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":810000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331772,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":500,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":810000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365844,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":500,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":810000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5344342,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":810000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966456,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-05T20:32:53Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T02:33:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54348,"name":"Francisco Tom\u00e1s","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Francisco is 51 years old and a native of Manjacaze, a district of Gaza in the south of Mozambique.

The first one was obtained from the credit corporation Tchuma in the amount of 18.000,00mt which was used to purchase home appliances. The first two loans from Hluvuku were in the amount of 15.000,00mt each and they were used to purchase construction materials for her home.

He is 24 years old and a single father of a 1-year-old daughter. He went to school up until the 7th grade but he had to drop out so that he could work more hours, earn more money and get married to his wife. Besides his family he is also responsible for his brother that lives in his home. \r\nAntonio left Vilanculos with an uncle that lived in Namaacha, a village that borders Swaziland, to look for work. He worked for his uncle for 2 years earning only 150,00mt. This very reduced amount was not enough for much and, in 2002, Antonio decided to start his own business. Using money he had saved from his salary, he left his uncle home and rented a room where he still lives. Antonio has been in the retail business for 6 years, working between the hours of 7:00am and 9:50pm when students are dismissed from school. His best selling products are radios, cds and cell phone chargers.

Malaulane","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"J\u00falio was born in Namaacha, on the border with Swaziland.  He studied through ninth grade, when conditions did not permit him to continue.  He is single and the father of seven children: the oldest are 16-year-old twins, the second is 12, the third 9, the fourth 7, the fifth 5, and the youngest only 1 year old.  J\u00falio is responsible for even more, sending food and money to his parents monthly, as he lives with their first two children.  <p>\r\n\r\nJ\u00falio began working in 1986 as a driver at the Hotel Pequenos Libombo, holding that position for eight years.  The salary was low and did not manage to cover the household expenses.  He therefore decided to quit working for his employer and to start his own business of selling fish in the informal market.  He was able to buy a car which has helped him greatly, even today.  J\u00falio moved out of his parents' house when he was able to do so.  Now he has his own business at his house and an employee who makes 1500 meticals (mt) per month working from 7:00am to 3:00pm.  J\u00falio earns 8400mt  per month, making 420mt per sack and using up 20 sacks per month.  He is not able to save anything because there are many expenses.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis is J\u00falio's second loan with Hluvuku [MFI Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  The first was for 10,000mt and was used to buy construction material to finish his work.  He succeeded in paying off the loan before it was due.  J\u00falio then returned and requested this loan of 20,000mt which he will use to buy brick-building material.  J\u00falio believes that this loan will improve his business because it will allow him to meet the needs of his clients.  For J\u00falio, his big dream is to increase his business and to send his children through school.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva Volunteer.  <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJ\u00falio nasceu em Namaacha uma que faz fronteira com a Swazilandia, solteiro, estudou at\u00e9 9\u00aaClasse, teve que parar de continuar com os estudos pois as condi\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o permitiam para que ele continuasse. \u00c9 pai de 7 filhos sendo os primeiros g\u00e9meos e tem 16 anos, segundo tem 12 anos, o terceiro 9 anos, o quarto 7 anos, o quinto 5 anos e o mais novo tem 1 ano apenas. J\u00falio responsabiliza-se mais ainda pelos seus pais enviando comida e dinheiro mensalmente pois este vivem com os seus dois primeiros filhos.<p>\r\n\r\nJ\u00falio come\u00e7ou a trabalhar em 1986 como motorista no Hotel Pequenos Libombo tendo exercido a fun\u00e7\u00e3o durante 8 anos. O sal\u00e1rio era pouco n\u00e3o chegava para cobrir com as despesas da casa  dai decide deixar de trabalhar no patr\u00e3o abrindo o seu pr\u00f3prio negocio de venda de peixe no mercado informal e conseguiu comprou um carro que lhe vem ajudando muito at\u00e9 hoje. Julio saiu da casa dos pais quando se juntou e hoje tem seu pr\u00f3prio estaleiro em sua casa e tem um trabalhador que aufere mensalmente um valor de 1500,00mt trabalhando das 7:00h as 15:00h. Tem lucrado mensalmente 8400,00mt sabendo que num saco ganha 420,00mt e gasta 20 sacos por mes, n\u00e3o consegue poupar nenhum valor pois tem muitas despesas.<p>\r\n\r\nEste \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo do J\u00falio na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva. O primeiro foi de 10000,00mt e usou para comprar material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o para concluir a sua obra. Ele conseguiu pagar o empr\u00e9stimo antes do prazo determinado. Assim o J\u00falio volta a solicitar este empr\u00e9stimo de 20000,00mt que usara o dinheiro para comprar material para fabrico de Blocos de cimento. J\u00falio acha que com este empr\u00e9stimo vai melhorar o seu negocio porque vai conseguir satisfazer as necessidades da sua clientela. Para J\u00falio constitui grande sonho ter mais estaleiros e formar os seus filhos.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":175041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"Sale of

All of them are informal micro-entrepreneurs and are currently in the 7th cycle of the program for Enterprising Woman. The committee's name, \"Yboty\", means flower in Guarani, the native language of Paraguay. The women are currently benefiting from a loan of around 718,000 guaranis each (roughly $200 USD). <p>\r\n\r\nThe group began with its first meetings in the home of Mrs. Marta M. who is currently the group's secretary. One of the characteristics of this group is that they are interested in constantly learning and always ask their assessor Freddy Bordon to school them in specific areas such as marketing, public relations, finances, break even points amongst other topics. <p>\r\n\r\nThe committee has embarked on a project for the month of June 2008 to host a celebration for Saint John in the neighborhood square. The proceeds will go to helping their neighbor who is currently ill but was once a member of the committee. <p>\r\n\r\nLaura, the group leader, expresses the thanks of all the members of the \"Yboty\" committee to the Paraguayan Foundation for being the only institution that has given them the chance to receive a formal loan to use as working capital and for enabling them to manage their own business. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nToday they are requesting a new loan to invest in their mirco-enterprises by purchasing products to be sold in their kiosks such as sugar, meats, rice, vegetables, fruit, candy, soda and others. Those who prepare and sell food, especially \"chipa\" (a traditional Paraguayan bread with cheese) need to purchase ingredients. The traveling saleswomen in the group will purchase various products including undergarments, clothes and kitchen utensils etc. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by In\u00eas Teles, Kiva volunteer.<\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 16 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Yboty de Caba\u00f1as de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9, todas son peque\u00f1as microempresarias informales y actualmente est\u00e1n en 7to.

Most of the milk production is sold from their home since the neighbours visit them to purchase fresh milk.<p>\r\n\r\nTwice weekly Marta produces cheese which is often purchased by the chiperos.  Chiperos elaborate a typical corn bread which is very popular in Paraguay.  Thanks to their hard work they are able to maintain their home and educate their children.

When asked about the microfinance community Felipa J. said, \u201cwe are all like family,\u201d referring to the mutual support in repaying and attending meetings that they give each other.\r\n\r\n<P>These entrepreneurs are dedicated to growing vegetables in their family-run fields and selling them in the convenient Solola market. They farm year-round and harvest 3-4 times a year, allowing them to keep consistent sales in the market. Some of the vegetables that they grow include cauliflower, onions, carrots, potatoes, herbs, and cilantro. \r\n\r\n<P>Their sales peak on Sundays during market day, and have been consistent enough to maintain entire families at a sustainable earn\/spend rate. These loans allow the farmers to think about increasing their output through investment in wholesale seed and fertilizer. Paula C. said that she would buy fertilizer by the pound rather than by the ounce. Some of these women lack tools for the fields where their husbands (and some employees) work. With the increased output, their 3-4 harvests per year would give them a higher yield and consequently more money to invest in their enterprise and in a good quality of life. \r\n\r\n<P>The hard work and growth is not solely for having more money. It is, according to Santa Cuj, to be proud about the success of their whole family\u2019s lifelong work, and to be able to send all of their kids to school while having some extra money to live well with. Their dreams include to be happy, to have more clothes, and to build a better house.\r\n\r\n<P>Don Jorge was included in the picture because he went to collect his sister\u00b4s loan due to her

Atiteca Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<P>The Jardin Atiteca community from Cerro de Oro is a very small community next to the smallest hump of a volcano in Lake Atitlan. The people enjoy living in such a community where everyone knows everyone. The festive seasons of Christmas and the town fair bring everyone together and give a boost in sales. \r\n<P>Their microenterprise consists of weaving the traditional <i>g\u00fcipil<\/i>, the top of the indigenous Mayan outfit,  either as a family or with employees (up to 8). To do so, they use the <i>telar de cintura<\/i>, a weaving method by which one person can weave a <i>g\u00fcipil<\/i> in about one day. They then sell this piece for about 150 quetzales (20 USD) to buyers, whether intermediaries, personal contacts or shoppers in the nearby villages of Santiago de Atitlan and San Lucas. Intermediaries take the clothing and sell it to women all around the lake, including women in Panajachel, Solola and Patzun.\r\n<P>There was consensus among the group that their businesses were doing well, since they sell a type of clothing that is not produced very much within Santiago and San Lucas. This low level of competition allows them to sell almost as fast as they produce.  So the only thing keeping them from selling more is their limited capital to invest. This is why they are loyal as a group to microlenders and have rarely missed or paid late.\r\n<P>According to the women, the credit has helped their business grow. They can now buy wholesale thread, cloth and dyes. The credit not only helps them buy their materials at a cheaper price, but also helps them be able to produce more items at once. Then, with their savings, they can repay the loans bit by bit. \r\n<P>The clients emphasized that these extra sales allow their business to grow, but most importantly, allow for an increase in income which serves to pay for their children\u2019s educational needs, medicine, and clothing. In addition, this extra money allows them to continue to expand their business, while living a more comfortable

They expressed contentment with their community, which rarely has conflicts and houses amiable neighbors.\r\n<P>They are dedicated to the creation of home-spun textiles, which they sell as clothing, napkins and blouses mainly to local women in the town market. \r\n<P>Their best day of sales is the Sunday market day.  They utilize the loans to buy wholesale cloth and thread in order to labor throughout the week to meet demand. Their loans also allow them money to live well while investing in the more expensive yet ultimately cheaper wholesale elements of their goods. Antonia Coti T. works with her husband in making textiles and now buys much more thread and embroidery supplies. Dominga Tziquin, the group leader, sells stone corn grinders in the Pacific coast towns.  \r\n<P>This credit has made things go well for them, according to Manuela C.. The increased flexibility in the balance of funds for living and funds for investment in the business allows their business to grow steadily. Most of their repayments have been so reliable that they have gone from about 100 USD to now almost 800 USD. \r\n<P>The women are unanimously happy to work in the Bugambilias group. \u201cWe all know each other and laugh with each other, which makes it easier to repay,\u201d commented Madgaelena T.. She went on to say that they help each other in repayment and remind each other about meeting dates and repayment dates.\r\n<P>These women, although focused on their business dreams such as increasing their amount of credit and the growth of their enterprise, have their true dreams rooted in seeing their children begin life in Guatemala with a head start. They wish to have the money to support a happy family which at the very least has the option financially to send their kids to school and give them a boost. This boost is slowly starting to be seen, as all of the mothers of this group currently send most or all of their children to school, despite the increasing

Mazbut is 49 years old. He is married and has six children. Her wife is a housekeeper. Mazbut has been providing taxi services for the last 20 years. Each day he transports construction materials of his clients with his lorry. Mazbut dreams that all of his children become well-educated so he works hard to provide them that opportunity. As a result the business generates significant income, allowing him to support his large family. This year is very important for Mazbut as he is going to send one of his sons to the university and arrange the wedding of another son.

The weavings are made with multicolored thread and look like spiderwebs, which is what \"\u00f1andut\u00ed\" means in Guaran\u00ed, the aboriginal language in Peru. In the photo, Saturnina hangs one of her \u00f1andut\u00eds that is well-liked by tourists that come to our country and always take one home as a souvenir. <p>\r\n\r\nThe previous loans she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya were used to purchase a good amount of thread, needles and accessories that permitted her to save some money now that she sells wholesale. <p>\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of using her savings in the future to buy a new type of Overlock sewing machine since the one she is using now is on loan from her mother and has some technical problems, which makes it hard to complete her works. <p>\r\n\r\nMrs. Saturnina is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for trusting her and affirms that it is one of the few organizations that help simple, hard-working people.

Mrs. Terotita A. found out about the program from a neighbor who was part of another group and decided to contact an advisor to learn about the requirements.  She told her neighbors and they agreed on a day to have an informational meeting in which 22 women, all very nervous, formed the group named San Rafael.\r\n\r\nOver time, many of them decided to leave the group for different reasons like travel and health among others, but each time new women were incorporated into the group.  These women, besides being housewives, have their own businesses that allow them to contribute to their families\u2019 income.  Their activitivites include things like making clothing, candy sales, clothing sales and the sale of other food items.\r\n\r\nThe group is now in its third cycle and there are 15 members that work together.  They attend their weekly meetings and have their own savings which they already have deposited in a cooperative.\r\n\r\nThe San Rafael Group is located in Posta Gaona, a rural area outside the city of It\u00e1.
