G. is from the village of Kidahon, Gingoog City. He is 57 years old. Elias is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Elias owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, and snack  foods in the local community. Elias has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elias joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elias has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products sell. Elias is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory like snack foods and beverages. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elias from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":662724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. is from the village of Kandiis, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. He is 60 years old. Rodrigo is married. To make a living, Rodrigo owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling seafood products, including fish like milk fish and sardines, in the local community. Rodrigo is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rodrigo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rodrigo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional coconuts to sell. Rodrigo is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Rodrigo from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Kandiis, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. She is 33 years old. Melanie is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Melanie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods & snack foods, in the local community. She changed her business from a mini restaurant to a retail store because she finds it more profitable. Melanie is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Melanie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melanie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & fund working capital. Melanie is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products like beverages & instant noodles. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Melanie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

G. is from the village of Mimbunga, Gingoog City. He is 39 years old. Bobby is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Bobby owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorela or habal-habal services to local community members. Bobby has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bobby joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bobby has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service. Bobby is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed for the maintenance of the service. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Bobby from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

people tend to migrates to different places even abroad to seek for a greener pasture. There are people who earned a big amount and has an investment but there are some who are not successful and later they only found out the fortune that they looked for is in their own place. That\u2019s what happened to Jocelyn M., one of the active members of ASHI Antique North Branch. She is from Caridad, Culasi, Antique Philippines, she is already 41 years old and a single businesswoman. She is living with her elder brother Johny M., a fisherman.\r\n\r\nBefore her life in ASHI, she was experienced work in another country. She doesn\u2019t have any comment for her employer because they treat her as their family. Her salary was only enough for the needs of the family until she decided to go back here in Philippines without any savings. She decided to join ASHI last 2002.\r\n\r\nAt very start, she has been wise in utilizing her capital for her business, with her first loan in ASHI amounted to Php.5,000.00, she started to put a small variety store in their community. Little by little her business is improving and she earned it. Her income from this business really helps her to sustain her basic needs and to invest in some equipment like refrigerator and television.\r\n\r\nAs her loan increases, her project is also improving. Her variety store is expanding and she almost sell grocery items in there. She also put up small refreshment near her store. \r\n\r\nAs of now she wanted to repair the store so that it is convenient and more comfortable to the costumers and she is now proposing Php.25,000.00 for her next loan to realize these dream. \r\n\r\nShe is aspiring that someday, she will become financially stable so that she could also help her nephews and relatives.

Mercedes is the group's president.  She is a very hard-working woman.  For a long time she has looked after her household alone.  When she separated she had to find a way of making a living since she had 3 children to support.  They were her inspiration to get ahead.  She remembers that when she used to work as a nurse people were always offering her different products and many people bought them.  So, conquering her fear, Mercedes began to do the same with her friends and family members who began to buy from her.  She started selling different products according to the season.  During the back-to-school season she would offer uniforms, shoes, tights, etc.  Now the Christmas season is here her loan will be used to buy toys.\r\n\r\nMercedes has a lot of orders from her customers and, thanks to her work, she can cover her family's main expenses.

He is married to Rosanna D., who works as a housekeeper, and together they manage the household and business. By the grace of God, Rodel has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nRodel operates a variety store while managing their videoke ( a karaoke with a video showing the lyrics of the song being sung) and their motorized tricycle. They rent out the videoke on a 24-hour basis, while the tricycle enables them to get purchase and deliver their products. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rodel earns income by getting supplies in wholesale price and selling them as single items.  His store is located adjacent to their house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of Php400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Rodel continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php25, 000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n \r\nRodel dreams to be able to renovate their house soon and have his children finish their college education, with all of his work with the business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Salud operates a family member's business in the agriculture sector engaging primarily in rice production in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 8,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ma. Salud joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase seeds and fertilizers. Ma. Salud is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers and pesticides and pay for labor to prepare the rice fields. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Ma. Salud from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is from the village of Malipayon, Pangantucan, Bukidnon. She is 41 years-old and married with two school-aged children. To make a living, Beverly owns and operates a bakery. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from baking and selling a variety of staple products including bread and cakes in the local community.  Beverly has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Beverly joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Beverly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Beverly is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tools for the maintenance of her baking equipment. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Beverly from HSPFI. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

V. is from the village of Mapuroc, San Mateo, Isabela. She is 43 years-old and married with three adult children. To make a living, Gina owns and operates a business in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Gina has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP when she sells one of her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gina joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Gina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

O. is from the village of Cebulin. She is 64 years old. Shirly is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Shirly owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Shirly has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Shirly joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Shirly is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Shirly from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is from the village of Poblacion, Don Carlos, Bukidnon. She is 50 years old. Leonarda is widowed and has two adult children. To make a living, Leonarda owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling clothing, bags, sandals, rubber boots & farm tools, such as shovels, in the local community. Leonarda has been engaged in her business for more than 19 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leonarda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonarda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Leonarda is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products, such as farm tools. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Leonarda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
