For 30 years she has been raising small animals like guinea pigs and chickens.  Her daughter supports her in feeding the animals.  Besides the animals, another source of income comes from renting rooms in her house.  Domitila feels that this is how she's making a living:  first she sells animals each week depending on her customers' needs and she rents rooms that are available.  Now she is focusing on planting alfalfa because it is the staple food of guinea pigs so that she can offer them at a good price.  And, she hopes that soon she can expand her farm, so that she can sell more animals.  \r\n\r\nThis is Domitila's 14th loan and is very happy to know she can have the financial support.

She tells us, \"I began to work when I was 37 years old selling quinoa and maca pancakes.  Later I had to change my business to selling beer from my house, owing to the fact that I had to raise my small child, and he needed my care.  I continued selling cakes and pudding that I prepared in my house and offered to the residents of my area.  Later I was encouraged to make dishes such as chicken soup, chaufa (a Peruvian rice dish),  spaghetti with beef, and to sell soft drinks; these dishes are preferred by the people in my neighborhood.   This business was a great help during the 6 months when my husband was not able to work. With him, I pay for the food expenses for my family and help with part of the educational expenses for my children, two of whom are professionals.  Over time I acquired a sandwich cart; my daughter works with it and helps us with the some of the household expenses.  Now I continue to sell food and prepare cakes and puddings.

The change in season has allowed her to sell cold drinks (quinua, maca, ponche de habas) as well as different types of sandwiches.

He founded the company in 2007 after working for a company that performed similar operations but without the focus on customer service that Michael really values. \r\n \r\nAt his previous job, Michael worked his way up from sales manager to controller, and realized one day, while the owner was away on vacation, that he knew enough to run the company himself. He has since proven that his instinct was correct: less than a week after starting his own business in July of 2007 he had made his first big sale, and this past year the company experienced a 350% growth rate. \r\n \r\nNot just getting through the recession but growing through it is something that Michael cites as his greatest accomplishment thus far. Michael explains that, as he saw the economic downturn begin, \u201cI knew I had to kick it into another gear. I\u2019ve worked 15-hour days, six days a week, and thanks to hard work we are growing. It\u2019s a very exciting time for us!\u201d \r\n \r\nDespite his experience in the industry, high customer retention rate, and business growth, Michael was repeatedly turned down when he approached banks for a loan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I sat there and they told me they could lend to me, and then declined me because in the end I didn\u2019t have collateral. It didn't matter that I had been in business for three years and had seen a large increase in sales... I couldn\u2019t believe it!\u201d \r\n \r\nA $8,000 loan from Opportunity Fund will act as a reliable source of working capital, something that is necessary for Michael to fill his customers' orders in time and avoid bank fees, and to continue growing the business. He is hoping to soon be able to hire additional employees and move the business from a satellite location to a commercial office space. \u201cI\u2019m always striving to go the distance, and go beyond what I\u2019ve already accomplished.\u201d \r\n \r\nTo find out more about Data Alliance Information Technology, visit:

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alicia P. is from the village of Cogon, Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental. She is 58 years old, married, and has three adult children. Alicia is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Alicia P.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Alicia owns and operates a flower shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Alicia has been engaged in her business for ten years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn June 2010, Alicia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alicia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to buy more flowers to sell. Alicia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used as additional inventory and working capital for her flower shop expansion. This loan will be the second taken out by Alicia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\n\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.

G. is a widow who lives in Sitio Tinago, Brgy.

Consolacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Consolacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, raising the family's standard of living.  For her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her youngest child. Consolacion is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

N. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Tinago, Brgy. Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: fish vending and pig fattening. Her husband Eliseo N., who is 63 years old, is retired and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children who are between 13 to 32 years old. Jovita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past twenty loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jovita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing 16,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more fresh fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs. Jovita N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

B. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Tinago, Brgy. Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a rice retailing  business. Her husband, Raul B., who is 51 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 6 and 26 years old. Ruth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past fourteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5600, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifteenth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use for additional capital for her rice retailing so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ruth is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\n Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Masinulondon, Tabao Proper, Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  Fishing and Crab Netting (Panggalan). Her husband, Renato, who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children, 10 to 19 years old. Luisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to maintain her crab nets and to buy more fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. She will also do some home repairs. Luisa E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing transportation services to local community members. Heide has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Heide joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Heide has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Heide is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Heide from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is a 66-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a food vending business. She lives in Sitio Suol, Barangay Nanunga, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10000. Aida is now borrowing PHP 18000 so that she could continue to fund the operations of her food products. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Aida aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

S. is a married woman who lives in Camp Valdez, Barangay Mambaroto, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: tobacco vending and vegetable vending. Her husband, Robelito S., who is 60 years old, earns his living as a farmer, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 23 to 38 years old. \r\n\r\nCecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 21000 again, so that she could continue sustaining the operations of her tobacco vending business and so that she can continue to save up for the future renovation of her house. Cecilia S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Malabuhan, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by fishing and selling fish. Her husband, Vitaliano M., who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who range in age from 23 to 30 years old. Rebecca joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,500, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business selling fish. She continues to save up for future home repairs. Rebecca M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Vilma Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eleven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma Gilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th  loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy inventory for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her grandson. Vilma Gilda C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Juma is 31 years old. He is married and the father of four children. Juma is an optimistic, hardworking father. He works his land with love and dedication every day, so that it produces excellent vegetables. Juma has been in the agrobusiness for more than nine years. In fact, he draws strength and vitality to make his products the best in the city. His loving wife is also engaged in this business. Though growing vegetables is a very difficult and time consuming job, he hopes to gather a rich harvest. He is planning to fix the house and save enough money for the wellbeing of his family.

With the desire to realize his plan, Juma appeals to your generous hearts for a swift contribution.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

is 63 years old and he has been married since the age of 26 to the mother of his 5 children. Nazri has worked in agriculture since he was a young. His father taught him how to responsibly work with each crop, and now, with the help of his wife and adult children, he feels a sense of dignity from his work. As a consequence, he treats each plant with affection and care until they are ready for harvest, at which point he takes them to sell in the market. Nazri would very much like to buy a house in the city to ensure the well-being and tranquility of his children, and in this way improve his quality of life. The money that Nazri is soliciting is to purchase seeds, chemical fertilizers, fuels and lubricants.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Angelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Angelita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Angelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Mirzorahmad is 49 years old, is married and lives with his wife and 8 children. He has been a farmer for the past 14 years, which he began with the goal of supporting his household and above all to satisfy the needs of his children. For Mirzorahmad, agriculture is an activity that he likes to do. Within it, vegetable production is what he likes most as it is easier to cultivate these plants and the product is profitable in season, which is annually. But the earnings are greater and beneficial for every farmer, especially when buyers purchase the product in great quantities and the expense of transporting the products is avoided as the buyers come to harvest and take them away themselves. Now Mirzorahmad wishes to borrow money, which he wants to invest in seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. He is sincerely grateful to all of you.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has to put much effort in this business to make it sustainable and profitable.\r\n\r\nShamsudin would like to receive a loan of $3000 to increase his inventory. Shamsudin has promptly repaid all loans from IMON International. We believe his integrity, responsibility and strong will can help him succeed and to repay the current loan without any problems. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

C. is from the village of Tabo-o, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Rhoda has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rhoda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rhoda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Rhoda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Rhoda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a single mother who raises her three children alone.

Even today, there is still little competition at the market where she sells her inventories. This business is her family's only income. Gavharjon has used business loans before and finds them very helpful. This time she is requesting a loan of 7000 Somoni to increase the variety of items she offers. Gavharjon hopes to restock her kiosk and make it more profit.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

By the grace of God, Melitona has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n<br>Yolanda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Yolanda earns a living by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at piece rates. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 11, 000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n<br>Yolanda dreams of renovating her house soon, with the profits from all of her work.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating these services. Donald has been engaged in his business for over one year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Donald joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Donald has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Donald is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Donald from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

The oldest makes a living selling milk and yogurt from a shop in the local market and the other two are still in school. She has applied for a loan which her husband will use to buy fresh seasonal fruits in bulk from wholesale markets. She believes that this loan will help her husband earn more money and operate his business more efficiently. \r\n\r\nFor the last nine years, Sughran and her family have lived in a two-room brick house in a small city named Khanewal. She is a member of Asasah and this is her third loan request. She paid her previous loans on time.

It was a very difficult time for her but she never loses hope. She recovered her senses and started working in her husband\u2019s fields along with her eldest son. She has worked very hard to raise her children. \r\n\r\nNow, as her eldest son has grown up, she no longer works. She stays at home and does her household chores.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at a piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nDaisy dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

I. M. is fifty-one years old and married to a business woman. They have four children between the ages of twenty-five and fifteen and they hope to be able to send their children to school through the university level. Urther's business is located in Kakamega. Kakamega is a region in Kenya, known for the production of sugar cane and widely referred to as the sugar belt region. He sells plastic containers and basins to the local people. He has been in this business for the last five years. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is that there are many other people in the area operating the same kind of business as his so customers are not loyal to him as they have many vendors to choose from.

She is married to Amado, an overseas Filipino worker, and mother of two toddlers. She works hard so as to be able to educate both her children all the way through college. It is a dream for most Filipino parents like Lita as she is a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave their children.\r\n\r\nLita operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, braided quilts, and bed sheets. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that can be bought \u2014 sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway!  Lita earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business,  Lita is requesting a Php12,000 loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.

 S., a married woman who lives in Sitio Sta. Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu, earns her living by operating a fishing business.  Her husband, Jaime S., 51 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have eight children who are between 9 and 29 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nLoreta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Loreta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Loreta  S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She is 28 years old, married, and has 4 children. Her husband is a second-hand clothing salesman. All of her children are students except for the youngest. Immediately after the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which would go on to completely destroy the town of Goma in 2002, Noella started a business with her own funds selling used clothes, running the same type of business as her husband. She displays her goods at the central market in Virunga. This new loan should serve to supply her stock with one bale of (used) clothing, with the remainder being used to pay for her children's school expenses and to build up some savings for a safety net. Furthermore, she aspires to become a wholesale used clothing seller. Noella thanks Hekima (one of Kiva's field partners) for its work on behalf of the poor who are excluded from mainstream banking. It must be noted that the Umoja Virunga group is composed of 18 women, of whom one is represented by her husband, since she was unable to be there during the loan

They have three children who are between 27 and 33 years old. Marilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. Marilou B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is Anita P., 57, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Mateo P., a rice dealer, and mother to three young hard-working adults. By the grace of God, Anita has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale price and selling at piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nAnita dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

All of her children are in school. Immediately after the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which would go on to completely destroy the town of Goma in 2002, she started a business with her own funds making dresses. Later, she received a loan of $50 from the microfinance institution Hekima (one of Kiva's field partners). She has set up her workshop at the central market in Virunga. This new loan should serve to supply her with fabric for women's dresses and fabric to make men's jackets. Furthermore, she aspires to move and install herself near the centre of the town to increase her visibility and make more sales.

Selonah joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Selonah has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for general store and maintenance for crab traps so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.

Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 22nd  loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children.\r\n\r\nNorma A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

A. is a married woman who lives in Purok Mauboy, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two (2) business ventures:  buying and selling peanuts and farming. Her husband Julieto A., who is 47 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 4 and 25 years old. Berlita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Berlita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more peanuts to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs. Berlita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

These businesses are crystal installing, pig fattening, and farming. She lives in Prk. Mabinuligon, Brgy. Maricalum, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of the NWTF - Project Dungganon since 2007, and she has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans and hard work. As a result, she is helping her family to become more economically stable, and she now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. \r\n\r\nJocelyn is borrowing PHP 18,000 so that she can continue to purchase raw materials. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF - Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 was repaid well within its term, and was a step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocelyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pamela C. is from the village of Union, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 32 years old. Pamela is the group leader for a six-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nPamela is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Pamela runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling food and daily use products in the local community. Pamela has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Pamela joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pamela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Pamela is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Pamela's second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":627459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Besides this business, Kenneth owns a retail shop in which he sells general items. He has been in this business for the last eight years. He says that this business is profitable and his major challenge is that there are many other people in the area doing the same kind of business he is doing, so customers are not loyal, as they have plenty of choices. However, he works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of 80,000 Kenyan shillings to buy stock of soft drinks to boost his business. He hopes to be a wholesaler in the future.

C. is a single woman who lives in Purok Kalobihan, Barangay Cartagena, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: buying and selling rice, a general store, and farming businesses. Rosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosemarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy rice to resell so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Rosemarie C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Keng B. owns a big farm that she inherited from her grandmother. Keng B. is now married and has nice children. Her husband (pictured here) works in the farm fields frequently alongside her. \r\n\r\nKeng B. currently plants a peanut crop and she estimates that she will harvest it within the next two months when the plants mature.

Hangkayaw, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a rice mill and farming. Her husband, Alipio Loquiso, who is 47 years old, works as a rice mill operator to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 5 and 21 years old. \r\n\r\nHazel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hazel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers for her farm so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the improvement of her businesses. \r\n\r\nHazel L. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon .

This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She is 42 years old. Emelita is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEmelita is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Emelita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Emelita has been engaged in her business for over 22 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Emelita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Emelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a married woman who lives in Purok Daisy, Brgy. Talacagay, Hinobaan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food vending and farming. Her husband Milo S., who is 51 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 18 and 22 years old, respectively. Alma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers and glutinous rice for her food vending so that she can continue to save or the future education of her child. Alma S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

For close to thirteen years, the family has lived in S\u00e8gb\u00e8ya, a district of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Agbuidohoin helps her husband in providing for the family. To meet her needs, Agbuidohoin runs a business selling various items (pasta, sugar, canned tomatoes and sardines, mayonnaise, soap, trays of fresh eggs, sauce condiments, cereal, milk, etc.) as well as smoked fish, at her home and at Dantokpa, the international market in Benin. Agbuidohoin gets her supplies at the same market and has run this business for about ten years. She is a longstanding client of ALID\u00c9 (one of Kiva's field partners), and repaid her previous loan with a slight degree of difficulty due to a sales slump. Currently, Agbuidohoin is seeking her fifth loan to raise the level of her business and better satisfy her

M. is a married lady with two children, ages six and two and one-half years old. Her business is located at Shinyalu market in Kakamega. Kakamega is a region in Kenya widely known as the \"sugar belt\" for its production of sugar cane. Florah has a shop in which she sells general items to the local people. In addition to this business, Florah also has a motorcycle that she uses to provide transportation services. She has been in this business for the past three years. She says that her business is profitable and that her major challenge is financial constraints. However, she works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of 30,000 KES to stock general items in her store in order to meet her customers' needs and grow her business. She will also use part of the money to repair her motorcycle.

She is 38 years old, widowed, and has one two-year-old child.  Mary has been farming for 10 years and employs one farmhand. Her mixed farm produces milk, beans, maize, and bananas, which she sells at the local market. She depends on the income from her farming activities to provide for the basic needs of her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 35,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. She says that her family will be guaranteed enough milk for consumption and her income will increase through the sale of milk. She will, therefore, be able to provide for her needs and that of her baby.\r\n\r\nHer primary challenges have been lack of market for her products, high cost of quality-bred cows, and lack of artificial insemination services in her area.

M. is 46 years-old and married with four children aged between 10 and 15 years-old. His business is located at Sejeri market in Kakamega. Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and widely known as the sugar belt region. He has a shop in which he sells general items to the local people. Besides this business, Simon mills timber and farms. He has been in this business for the last three years now. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is financial constraints. \r\n\r\nSimon works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well.

T. is a 39 year-old female living in the town of Hoang Hoa.  Thu is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 020304-Bac Son-Hoang Phu.\r\n\r\nThu is married and has two school-aged children.  To making a living, Thu operates a family member's fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling wild-caught fish in the local community.  Thu has been engaged in this business for over 19 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Thu joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional fish to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by Thu from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Thu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1. Hoa T. M. is a 43 year-old female who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her business in the retail sector selling home products.\r\n\r\n2. Nga N.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and

Q. is from the village of Kabatangan, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 58 years old. Madrona is married and has 8 adult-aged children. To make a living, Madrona owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods and packaged food. She also buys and sells vegetables, such as squash. Madrona has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Madrona joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Madrona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Madrona is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Madrona from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in a monogamous family with her husband and children in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord district of the town of Bougouni (Sikasso region). \r\n\r\nShe abandoned school early on in favor of income-generating activities, notably the buying and selling of fruits and vegetables such as bananas. She has been in this business for more than 9 years, which explains her good command of this activity. She gets her supplies from producers in the community of Sido and in surrounding villages. Sido is a rural community located 25 kilometers from Bougouni. She learned this business at a young age from her cousin.\r\n\r\nAfter a few solidarity loans with an association in her district, she decided to get her first individual loan. This is her fourth individual loan, after having successfully repaid all previous loans. This woman has been collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso for six years now.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use her loan to buy and then sell bananas in different districts and markets and also in front of the town hall of the urban community of Bougouni. With this loan, Mariam hopes to make a monthly profit of 40,000 CFA francs. With these profits, she plans to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":627641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase bananas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-27T08:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":35274.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613648,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":35274.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752085,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":35274.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606333,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":35274.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917994,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":35274.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360920,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":35274.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226225,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-27T11:44:04Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":242932,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys B. is from the village of Francfort, Bumbaran, Lanao del Sur.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Every year he spends about 10,000 \u2013 12,000 Grivnyas on seeds and polyethylene film to protect greenhouses. \r\n\r\nAlexander has recently purchased two farmland lots.

He also earns income from his bookshop in the same area.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 45000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from this loan will help him pay school fees for his children and expand his business operations. His primary challenges have been lack of enough money to buy farm inputs like fertilizers and animal feeds, as well as low market prices and the poor road network in the area, which hinders transportation to the market.\r\n\r\nHe aspires to have 10 dairy cows in five years and to expand his bookshop.

is married with grown son and a daughter. She lives in Zaporozhye. Tatyana sells office supplies, dishware and umbrellas in the local market called \u2018Yubileinyi\u2019. She owns three vending locations in the same marketplace. She launched her enterprise thirteen years ago. Currently, Tatyana has over 70,000 UAH in inventory. Her gross income is over approximately $2540 a month. \r\n\r\nTatyana is seeking a loan of 12,000 UAH to increase her turnover capital and purchase assorted merchandise.

He says that with the proceeds from this project, his children are assured of a good education and food sustainability in the family.

She appreciates the opportunity to be a member of the organization."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":627826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase fruitcake","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Yarinacocha - Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.308056 -74.601389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-11-25T04:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria Hayde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":261.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182583913,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":261.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188719562,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":261.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191458039,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":261.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195880281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-25T07:12:43Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:05:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":243045,"name":"Paul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paul is 29 years old and married.
