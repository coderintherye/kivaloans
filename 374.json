She lives together with her 2 daughters, who are studying at university. This fills Maria with pride and hope, as all her hard efforts can be seen in the well-being of her daughters, who are forging a better future. Maria has a clothing sale business, which is located on the second floor of the Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n market, a market frequented by affluent people due to its location in the centre of the Salvadorean capital. \r\n\r\nMaria has worked doing this for 15 years. She has many clients who request a large amount of clothes, to stock smaller businesses such as shops and others. It is this way that through the years Maria has been able to support her daughters, who have been able to move forward thanks to the enormous efforts of their mother, who has always sacrificed herself for them. With the wish of improving her business, Maria is seeking a loan from Integral, to be able to stock her shop with skirts, blouses, trousers, and children's and adult's clothing in many styles. Maria does all this in the hope of generating better sales, which bring as many benefits for her as they do to her daughters. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva

She is an empresarial woman who works very hard to obtain more clients and sell more each day, to be able to live better together with her husband. Isabel is seeking a loan from Integral to obtain the necessary capital to buy a larger quantity of medicines and other sweets such as lollies, churros and biscuits, which will allow her to have more clients. She has had this business for 8 years, during which time she has made acceptable earnings, despite having few products. It's for this reason that Isabel wants to increase her inventory and grow as a micro-businesswoman. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva

a mother with big dreams, Margie joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.) in 2007. ASHI is a microfinance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since joining, Margie started selling ready-to-wear clothes, which has really helped meet her family's needs. Now on her fourth loan, Margie is requesting 17,000 PHP to pay for more inventory for her business. Specifically, she will use the loan to pay for blouses, shirts, kids' jackets, jeans, short pants, and other supplies.\r\n\r\nMargie G. is a thirty-one-year-old woman with the determination and faith to get out from the spiral of poverty. She is a mother of four children. She is married to Sotero; a caretaker, and the salary of her husband is insufficient for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of ASHI the KIVA field partner, she can reach her ambition to move out from under the umbrella of poverty, expand her business, and pay for the needs of her four children in school. One of her greatest dreams is to have a house and lot of their own.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: \r\nAs a micro-finance institution that uses the Grameen methodology, and as the first practitioner in the field, Ahon sa Hirap (ASHI)--which means \"rise above poverty\" in English--saw how these poor women mothers work hard to earn money to improve the cash flow for their family and to provide their children with a better life. Because the microcredit ASHI is extending to these women is delivered directly to their villages and on the doorstep of their houses, these loans give these women hope that someday they will rise above poverty.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ester C. is from the town of Pagrang-Ayan Ramon. She is thirty-eight years old. Ester is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Ester C.'s group.\r\n\r\nEster is married. To make a living, Ester owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Ester has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ester joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ester has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. She used the previous loan to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Ester is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Ester's second loan taken from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

The official name of this borrowing group is Pacita A..\r\n\r\nPacita is married and has 4 adult children. Pacita owns & operates a fruit and vegetable retail business. Pacita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pacita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Pacita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Poblacion 1, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 33 years old. Liezel is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Liezel owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Liezel has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Liezel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liezel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Liezel is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be her third loan from PMPC.

She lives in a large traditional family in Bougoula Ville, the central town of Sikasso (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Ramatoulaye is a seamstress by profession and she buys bundles of sheets, curtains and tablemats in order to alter them and resell them; she has been doing this for more than twenty years. She carries out this activity from home where she has her own sewing machine. \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy her ever increasing customer base, she decided to join the mincrofinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, over six years ago. After several group loans with an association of women in her neighborhood, she is now on her ninth individual loan and all the previous loans have been repaid correctly. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she is planning to buy eight parcels of tablemats, eight bundles of curtains and eight bundles of sheets. She gets her supplies locally from wholesalers, and she sells generally for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of women.\r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make a monthly profit of 250,000 FCFA which will be used essentially to expand her business, contribute to family expenses and pay the interest on her loan; the rest will be invested in her activity.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":512181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of sheets, curtains and tablemats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746578,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779127,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961327,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699445,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913364,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-24T20:18:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187753,"name":"Mr. Hoeung Seng Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The 10 people who have applied for this loan live in Preaek Bak village in Kandal province.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, his other wife and their children in Sanoubougou 1 (Kapel Kourou), one of the peripheral neighborhoods of the town of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nSince she did not have the chance to progress at school, Di\u00e9lika very quickly established an income-generating activity, notably the purchase and sale of vegetables and tubers (potatoes, sweet potatoes and yams), ten years ago. She carries out this activity at the fruit and vegetable market at the foot of the Mamelon hill, not far from the big market in Sikasso.\r\n\r\nWishing to satisfy her ever increasing customer base better, she decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, seven years ago. After several group loans with a women's association in her neighborhood, she is on her sixth individual loan. With this loan she is planning to buy 35 sacks of potatoes, 20 sacks of yams and three sacks of sweet potatoes. She buys her goods wholesale and locally from producers before reselling them retail for cash and often on credit to a diversified customer base. \r\n\r\nShe expects that with this loan she will make a monthly profit of 300,000 FCFA which will be used essentially to expand her business, contribute to family expenses and pay the interest on her loan; the rest will be invested in her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":512185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase tubers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Di\u00e9lika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.45,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746579,"comment":null},{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779128,"comment":null},{"amount":95.45,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961328,"comment":null},{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699446,"comment":null},{"amount":95.45,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913365,"comment":null},{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180535,"comment":null},{"amount":95.45,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476559,"comment":null},{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613349,"comment":null},{"amount":95.45,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751831,"comment":null},{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606072,"comment":null},{"amount":95.45,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":46197.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917732,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-26T00:27:13Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187756,"name":"By God's Grace Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther T. is the leader of a group of five borrowers called By God's Grace.  She sells lapa (a wax-printed fabric popular in many parts of Africa) at the Red Light Market on the outskirts of Liberia's capital, Monrovia.  Esther plans to use her 8,000 Liberian Dollar portion of this 36,000 Liberian Dollar group loan to buy more lapa fabric for resale.\r\n\r\nEsther is 45 years old, married, and has seven children whose ages range from 8 to 24 years old.  Her youngest children attend elementary school and the oldest have attained a senior high education.  Esther herself was never able to go to school, as she says her parents refused to let her go.\r\n\r\nEsther has had her lapa fabric business for about 8 years now and she says she started small.  Her business has grown but she says it's difficult because there are many other lapa sellers nearby, so competition is stiff.  She says she tries to distinguish herself from her competitors by buying lapa fabric of high quality with fine designs.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Esther is the one holding the sign.

She is a seamstress and plans to use her 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 24,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more materials for tailoring, such as fabric, thread, and other items.\r\n\r\nTamey is 42, single, and has three children aged 5, 10, and 12 years old.  Her kids are all in elementary school.  Tamey, a high school graduate, also helps care for two siblings.\r\n\r\nTamey has been a seamstress for about 12 years and has a stall at the Red Light Market.  Red Light, located in Paynesville on the outskirts of Liberia's capital, Monrovia, is the country's largest marketplace.  She says she started her trade by apprenticing, and then opened her own business with starter capital of about $100 U.S.\r\n\r\nTamey says that the main challenge she faces in business is a good one -- customer demand is high and she has difficulty keeping up with orders.  She says her customers like her because she sews well and completes orders in a timely manner.  Tamey hopes that if her business continues to be a success, she will be able to afford to buy more sewing machines to expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Tamey is the one holding the sign.

Mrs. S. started in the business of selling palm oil. Next she started selling thioub (dyed cotton cloth) from Mali and sometimes wax cloth (a high quality pagne cloth). She has 5 years of experience in this business. It is also a business that she chose for love and for necessity, as her husband is retired, and it is up to her to make money to financially support her children. Thus, she is seeking a 200,000-franc loan to be able to order thioubs in Mali through her daughter, who is a trader and often travels to buy goods. Holidays like the Tabaski (or Festival of Sacrifice) or the Korite bring her a lot of business, which allows her to meet her personal needs, as well as those of her family. It also allows her to take care of her medical expenses, since she is very sickly.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva

Their school was built by missionaries in 1991 to help educate orphans in and around Makeni City. The school has a total of eighteen staff members and 300 pupils.\r\n\r\nTeachers are among the least paid workers in Sierra Leone. Because of this, many of them find other alternative means of making a living. Some engage in businesses or agriculture and others organize extra classes for the pupils (though that is a practice the government is trying to abolish). Teachers therefore seek a loan in order to embark on meaningful projects and then out of their monthly salaries, they gradually repay the loan.\r\n\r\nIssa K.

Later she sells snacks, hosiery, and fruit, and later food once more.  She is satisfied with her work and [the income] allows her children to attend school and also allows her to pay for food.  She is asking for this loan in order to buy ingredients (meat, condiments, pasta, baked goods) and other items to sell as snacks (chocolate, caramel).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":512251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Compra de ingredientes para la elaboraci\u00f3n de comestibles (carne, condimentos, pastas, panificados) y otras mercader\u00edas para vender como golosinas(chocolate, caramelos).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Paraguari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26 -57.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laureana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Gilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":7718830,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":482427},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":482425}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":928.13,"local_amount":4341843,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4352731.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136680162,"comment":null},{"amount":515.62,"local_amount":2412135,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2418183.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714572,"comment":null},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":964852,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":967271.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151898085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-02T21:03:23Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187803,"name":"Woodtu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph J. is the leader of a group of five borrowers named Woodtu.

The association was founded in 1993 by 20 female entrepreneurs in order to increase their purchasing power by means of a \"tontine\" (a revolving fincance system whereby each member contributes an agreed amount periodically and this is passed on in rotation to different members). \r\n\r\nSince this policy does not allow all members to get funding at the same time, they decided to join the IMCEC in order to obtain a loan without being asked for guarantees. For this reason the members divided into sub-groups of five, with each of these sub-groups designating a president and a treasurer. These sub-groups, which all carry the name Takku Liggey in the Medina Fall savings institution, can retain the same members for numerous years, but often the members do change because of financing needs and other considerations. The AFDE organises members' meetings on a monthly basis where all sub-groups and branches are convened, and it also runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other products at preferential prices. \r\n\r\nThe AFDE is led by a president, whose name is Mrs Diarra MAR and a treasurer, Mrs.Nedeye Ndella D., both residents of Thi\u00e8s. The sub-group, Takku Liggey No. 28 is run by Mrs. Mame Bousso Baye, who is 29 years old. This woman, who has four children, has been a door-to-door saleswoman for two years. She sells pagnes (West African colourful fabric), sheets, pearls and incense to her customers. She has been influenced in this trade by a friend of her father who encouraged her and helped her to sell her products outside Thi\u00e8s. With this loan she is planning to get supplies of products (incense, pearls, sheets) in order to strengthen her activity. She participates in the sub-group with: \r\n- Mrs. Khoudia S., the treasurer, who sells \"bine-bine\" pearls, sheets, and incense which she has inherited from her mother\r\n- Mrs. Awa T., who sells washing powder\r\n- Mrs Khady D., who is active in trading peanut, ni\u00e9b\u00e9 beans and bissap (a refreshing drink made from hibiscus flowers).  \r\n- Mrs. Awa F., who also sells \"bine bine

Alcira is very hardworking and as she has four children to raise she gets up in the early hours of the morning to start work. \r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used to purchase seeds to sow potatoes as it is now sowing season, and after harvesting them she will sell them in the local market.

This association was founded in 1993 by twenty women entrepreneurs to increase their purchasing power by way of a tontine (a revolving credit system in which each member periodically pays a suitable amount and which funds its various members by turns). This policy does not allow every member to be financed on the same day. \r\n\r\nThe members decided to join IMCEC in order to award loans without guarantee requirements. Thus, the members are divided into sub-groups of five, each with a designated president and a treasurer. These sub-groups, which are called Takku Liggey in the Medina Fall branch, can be the same for several years but often change their members according to the financing of needs and other considerations. \r\n\r\nThe AFDE organizes member meetings each month, when all the sub-groups and branches are invited. It facilitates cooperation for its members, enabling them to buy rice and other goods at better prices. The AFDE is lead by a president by the name of Ms. Mame Diarra MAR and by a treasurer, Ms. Ndeye Ndella Diouf , both residents of Thi\u00e8s.\r\n\r\nThus, the sub-group Takky Liggey n\u00b0 30 regroups five women in the same business. They sell charcoal and firewood under the control of the Water Affairs and Forestry department to avoid contributing (as they say) to the degradation of nature. This loan allows them to develop their activity and reinforce solidarity through their group deposit. The sub-group is led by Ms. Tabara Tiagne, 50 years old and mother of seven children. This lady knows the business and has an accumulated six years\u2019 experience. She is joined in this group by the Treasurer Ms. Anta Gu\u00e8ne, Ms. Ndeye Ndella L., Ms. Ouzine L. and Ms. Khady B..\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":512270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Obtain charcoal and firewood supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Ndella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ouzine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036702,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759315,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790826,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971259,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708534,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922580,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-21T09:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189088,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484521,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620764,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-11T14:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":37508.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758358,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-25T13:38:01Z","paid_date":"2011-02-11T14:35:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187813,"name":"Julio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio trabaja como transportista de carga (papa, chu\u00f1o \u2013 es papa que ha sido procesada de diferente manera -, carne de cerdo) la esposa es comerciante de carne de cerdo por kilo;

Fatumah also appears in the big group photo. She is a buoyant 21 year old who has ventured early into business.\n\nAt her young age, Fatumah, by conventional standards, should still be in school. However, she decided to go against the societal grain. As such, she took root in a hair salon business almost two years ago in Kireka, Mukono district.\n\nBeing single has, in a way, played into Fatumah\u2019s hands, in that she has had no major responsibility to bear so far and, as such, she has built on her business experience. In the course of time, she has given her business the quality time and devotion it needs.\n\nSince the inception of her business, Fatumah has managed to steadily sustain her finances. On a monthly basis, her financial gains amount to 140,000 shillings. She credits her suave business skills as one factor which has kept her above the competition.\n\nNotwithstanding her successes, Fatumah envisages an even brighter future for herself if she can obtain a loan to sustainably expand her business.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":512288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Angelita commented that she had to start dedicating herself to this activity because her husband, like the majority of men of the zone, works as an agricultural laborer and the income he receives is insufficient to cover family expenses.\r\n\r\nShe wants to expand her business by buying more birds to fatten and sell to business people who visit the zone regularly.  With this motive, she decided to ask Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1,500 New Sols to help her achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nAngelita is happy, hard-working, and very committed to her family.  She has worked before with our institution and has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility in her payments, for which reason we consider her an excellent client.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":512313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"BUYING POULTRY TO EXPAND HER BUSINESS","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Pava -

Her thoughts for now, though, are focused on obtaining this loan to help her reinvest in this project.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":512333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more jerrycans (containers) and brewing materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maureen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haruna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3850000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":240625},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":240625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187854,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nTeresa tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, es separada y vive junto a sus dos hijos, uno de los cuales ya trabaja, en la ciudad de Lambayeque, ubicada a 20 minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nHace cinco a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 a vender productos cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo, con mucho esfuerzo pudo obtener un grupo de clientes fieles, los cuales le recomendaron ampliar su negocio instalando un puesto de venta en su vivienda.

","en":"Alicia, who is 46 years old, lives with her husband and her son in a rented house. For 22 years, she has sold food in her rural restaurant which she built in her house. Her great talent and calling in the kitchen have succeeded in attracting the most demanding palates of her customers, who come in to her restaurant every day to eat the different typical dishes of her region which she prepares. In her work, she relies on the support of two young women whom she has hired to wait on the public, while she prepares the food and administers the premises. The length of her experience has permitted her to see the profitability of her business, since she has succeeded in supporting herself without experiencing economic difficulties. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future she plans to expand and improve the infrastructure of her business. This is the ninth time that she has had a loan, and she is grateful to all the people who made the loan possible, since it will be very useful in the progress of her business. Alicia is thinking of investing the money requested in the purchase of kitchen utensils, which she needs for her banquet services (for big social events), which she has recently been offering in her restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

Faced with ever increasing customer demand, N'k\u00e9chi is applying for a fifth loan in order to strengthen her business and better respond to the multiple demands of her customers. <br

long term goals are to build sustainable businesses and to fund her five children\u2019s college education.  With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her businesses will generate steady income to improve her financial stability and her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Theresa joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. When she received her previous loans, she invested the money in buying and selling of RTW (ready-to-wear-clothes) and later expanded the business with more inventory. For supplementary income, she is also embarked in an Electronic Loading business such as Smart load, Globe load, and Sun load.\r\n\r\nNow on her 3rd loan, she requested 10,000 PHP as additional working capital for her E-load business.

He lives in the town of Baye-Laye, more specifically in the neighborhood of Touba Bagdad 2. He is 29 years old, married and father to three children, whose ages vary between eight months and 9 years old. He is by profession a sheet metal worker but also does general mechanics. He has five years experience in the sheet metal trade. Mr. N. is an illiterate who entered into the sheet metal profession not because of any influence, but because he liked it. He is able to maximise his profits in the winter because it is during this period that a lot of cars break down. He is applying for a loan of 125,000 francs to buy materials for his workshop such as a generator, blow-torch, files etc. This loan will allow him to be more productive in his work and to be able to provide better for his family's needs.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

She has been selling merchandise for the last 10 years when her mother inspired her and showed her the business.  She likes to work independently and doesn\u2019t picture herself as an employee in a company.  \r\nCurrently she is requesting a loan of $1,500.00 to put together with some savings that she has and buy items that were requested, like a washing machine, irons, air-conditioning units, and supplies, that she will sell according to the requests by her main customers, housewives.  \r\n\r\n10 years ago she worked with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and was an excellent client. But she had gone to live in Bogota and only two years ago returned to this organization to be able to help her business continue growing.  \r\nWith the working capital she has received,  she has been able to increase the services she offers to her customers, and put the money into the business.  She could take out enough to educate her children and even buy them a computer.  She purchased this so that they would be knowledgeable about technological advances.\r\nCurrently she is very happy because her husband has a good job in Cesar department and she knows that now, with more support, she can fulfill her dream of setting up a big store because he is ready to help her.  She feels proud to be a businesswoman, because she has grown personally and has been able to help her family get ahead, especially in the periods when her husband wasn\u2019t working.  She is also grateful to the Foundation and says that she plans to build a house in the San Pablo development, along with her big store.  Also she will send her son to the university.  These are her three goals.\r\n\r\nOne of her first needs is to buy a new refrigerator because she sells soft drinks and shellfish that she needs to store in the refrigeration.  The one that she has is too small for the demands of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She is a consultant for Rommanel jewelry (jewelry made with semi-precious stones), she sells clothing, and she also has a phone booth business.  She has been in business for about 15 years.  She began alone, selling gold jewelry.  She was encouraged to get into sales of semi-precious jewelry because of her youngest child.  With two older children and then the youngest one, it became difficult for her to travel, so when she found out about the semi-precious jewelry business in the city of Manta, she became part of the business and has continued with it until now.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been married for 23 years.  She has three children, two of them grown up and one still young.\r\n\r\nThe phone business is set up in her house.  In the beginning, her eldest son ran it since he was about to enter the university and chose to start this business to help him pay for his studies.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda manages the jewelry and clothing sales herself.  She tries to schedule her time well, so in the mornings she does the household chores and in the afternoons she sells jewelry and clothing.  She has regular customers and is finding new customers as she expands her business.  Her investment in the businesses is according to their needs.  For the jewelry it is according to how the purchases and sales are going.  Since she's been doing this for many years, the suppliers offer her credit until her sales are finalized.  Although normally these sales must be paid in advance, the suppliers know she is responsible.  For the phone booths, the investment is only for prepaid phone cards.\r\n\r\nShe is happy because with the new loan she will invest in more clothing.  Mother's Day is approaching, and she knows sales will be high, so she will invest in clothes for women.  Her dream is to get ahead.  A niece encouraged her to join the communal bank, and for now she is very happy with her business because it is profitable.  She knows that with the next loan, everything will be much better.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":512436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674809,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708986,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892282,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632663,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846726,"comment":null},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113248,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T18:10:53Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187912,"name":"Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roc\u00edo tiene 34 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera y vive con sus 2 hijos, en su casa propia.

She has worked in agriculture and farming for 15 years.  Her principal crops are alfalfa, which she feeds to her guinea pigs and cows, and rue, which is an aromatic herb native to her area.  She inherited large tracts of land in her region from her parents; she generates income from this land.  Every 15 days she visits her fields of rue to cut the flowers and take them to the market.  Herbalists buy the flowers and use them as natural curatives.  The sale of flowers is very profitable because she receives income every two weeks, and the plantings last 3 years on average, which is not the case with other crops such as potato or corn.  In the future, she wants to acquire more land and increase the number of cattle and guinea pigs on her farm.  This is her eighth loan from MFP (Microfinanzas Prisma, local lending institution).  She is very responsible with her payments and considers this loan very important.  It will be very useful in the growth of her business.  This loan will be used to purchase bags of fertilizer and seeds and to sow more alfalfa and rue on other land, so that her business will last for a long time and her animals will never lack food.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":512438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase bags of fertilizer and seeds of alfalfa and rue","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-23T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":146.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":170.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":177.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":185.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.03,"local_amount":146.75,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":156.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718206,"comment":null},{"amount":58.66,"local_amount":156.41,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":166.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751881,"comment":null},{"amount":60.89,"local_amount":162.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":172.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934338,"comment":null},{"amount":64.03,"local_amount":170.76,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":181.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673108,"comment":null},{"amount":66.71,"local_amount":177.89,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":189.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886938,"comment":null},{"amount":69.68,"local_amount":185.81,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":197.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153941,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-24T00:10:05Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187913,"name":"Mujeres De Esperanza 1,2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicia is the coordinator of her group Mujeres de Esperanza (Women of Hope), and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

But, she is a hard-working, responsible woman.  She is dedicated to two businesses: clothing sales and the sale of Esika beauty products.  She has sold clothing for 7 years.  She buys the clothes in Guayaquil from wholesalers twice a month.  She has sold Esika for just 4 months.  She intends to use the funds to invest in her businesses.\r\n\r\nThanks to her good disposition toward work, her businesses are quite profitable and she assures us that they produce good profits.  She has regular customers in Montecristi and in Manta.  She is 25 years old and has been involved in three loan cycles with the foundation.  She is grateful to the foundation because she has had good profits during these three cycles.  She sells women, men and children clothing on one-month credit.  At the end of the month, she collects from her customers, recovers her capital, and acquires products again.\r\n\r\nMaryuri will use these new funds to travel to buy more merchandise; she has several pending orders because the new school term is approaching and May is another good month for high sales volume.\r\n\r\nMaryuri\u2019s dream is to have her own clothing store.  In general, she invests 500 dollars in the business and does quite well.  She also dreams with owning her own home.  Thanks to her work and effort she already owns a lot; now she just has to build the house.  She is sure that she will reach this goal with her hard work.\r\n\r\nHer mother is a clothing merchant too.  Maryuri wanted to start working since she was very young.  As she had some savings, 200 dollars, she invested them and doubled her investment.  She then reinvested and now sees the fruits of her labors.  Thanks, too, to the communal bank she is working even harder to make her business grow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":512422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-23T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marjorie Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":990,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674811,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708988,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892284,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632665,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846728,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113250,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T23:24:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187918,"name":"Manuela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nManuela tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad, es separada y vive junto a un hijo en el caser\u00edo Lagartera, una caser\u00edo de la zona rural del distrito de M\u00f3rrope, en la provincia de Lambayeque, situado a una hora de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nLa necesidad de salir adelante junto a su hijo hizo que hace diez a\u00f1os empezara a dedicarse a la crianza y venta de animales.

She is currently married, 50 years old and has three sons, all of them grown up. She started this business six years ago; what she did then was to buy clothes in Managua and go out to sell, since the prices of the articles of clothing are more expensive. Most of her sales are on credit, and are collected in 15 days, or 30 days at the latest. Currently she is requesting this credit to invest in the purchase of two bundles of used clothing, since she wishes to diversify the products she is currently offering her customers.

C. is 60 years old and lives in the department of La Libertad with her husband (a bricklayer) and her two-and-a-half year old grandson. Isaura is a very hard-working woman who makes wood furniture items such as tables, dressers, wardrobes, etc. She has a lot of experience as she has been practicing this traD. since she was 21. She has developed a reputation for being responsible and dedicated to her work. These qualities have allowed her to make and keep several clients, including some furniture stores in La Libertad, and to make a good living. Isaura requests this loan from Integral to purchase additional cedar wood (at wholesale) so that she has enough raw materials to fulfill all of her orders. Unfortunately, at times she has been unable to take orders, or has been late in completing orders, due to a lack of access to enough raw material. Therefore, this loan will allow her to improve her business. As a dedicated, hard-working entrepeneur, Isaura continues to move forward and to proviD. for herself and her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jim Muir, Kiva

Mar\u00eda has a fruit and vegetable stand in the Santiago de Mar\u00eda Municipal Market, which is also in eastern El Salvador.  She and her husband have managed this business for many years and it has helped them move forward so that they can have a decent life.  It has provided them with the most basic necessities for them to survive.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan so that she will have the necessary funds to invest in her business.  She will buy a variety of vegetables as well as all kinds of seasonal fruits that people are requesting more of, such as mangos and plums.  The fruits are greatly consumed in the months of March and April because of the Holy Week festivities.  Since more fruit is traditionally purchased around this time, Mar\u00eda wants to take advantage of the season so that she can earn extra income to help stabilize her household finances.\r\n<br

Her business was born from a desire to help her family financially, given that oftentimes they did not have enough income to cover household expenses.  For this reason, Ana wishes to continue growing the business, an endeavor that has helped stabilize the family economically.  Ana requests a loan in order to buy corn at wholesale, as this would allow her to obtain it at a better price.  In addition, she would like to buy some propane gas tanks to have in reserve.  At times, propane is scarce, and having some additional tanks would keep her business from being affected when there are fuel shortages.  This problem has affected her in the past.  These items would be a great help to her, as she would be able to improve her business and attract more customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

R., 54 years of age, lives in Santiago D. Mar\u00eda of the Usulut\u00e1n region, located in the eastern part of the country.  She lives with her son, who is an employee at a private enterprise.  Rosa dedicates herself to selling French fries, which she sells with catsup, grated cheese and mayonnaise.  Her business is located near a bus station, where people travel from the capital to Santiago D. Mar\u00eda.  This is a very strategic location since many travelers stop to buy her products, as they are hungry after the trip.  This is how Rosa makes a living, hoping each day to earn a little more than the previous day.  She is requesting a loan to have funds to invest into her business, to buy items such as potatoes, cheese, tomato sauce, oil, and gas.

Magnolia is 36 years old and lives with her spouse and their two children, aged four and two months. \r\n\r\nMagnolia runs a restaurant business out of her house. When she first opened the restaurant, she only sold soups in the morning. She has recently expanded and is now open for lunch as well.

Life in the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other dangers.

It is located in Cuenca in the central south region of the country, enjoying a cold climate, appropriate for cultivation of vegetables, fruit and corn.  It is also characterized by its variety of typical food, such as roast pork, guinea pig, and other delicacies of the region.  On this occasion, we were accompanied by Deysi Ure\u00f1a, the bank's credit promoter.  In the photo she is wearing brown, has glasses, and is behind the member in red.\r\n   Mrs. Silvia lives in her husband's house in the Cristo del Consuelo (Christ of Consolation) sector with her 2 children who are still small (7 years old and 5 months since birth).  Her husband has resided abroad for 20 years and, now that he has his papers in order, he visits his family every 4 months.  She is 28 years old and is a professional driver, who has been driving a school transport van for 6 years.  She has 2 routes, one from 5:00 am until 8:00 am in which she brings young people to a school in the city, and the other from 12:00 am to 1:00 pm, with young people from a school in her locality.  These activities she combines with household responsibilities, caring for her children, and in her free time, she makes artistic nylon purses, which she learned how to do 10 years ago, thanks to her abilities and imagination.\r\n   She is in her 2nd loan cycle with the foundation, motivated by a friend and member of the little bank.  With this loan she will invest in her vehicle, buying some replacement parts and tires and, also, buy nylon to continue making purses.  Her goal is to buy a small auto to get away with her children on weekends.\r\n   Mar\u00eda Angeles is another member of the Las Morlaquitas bank.  She lives with 4 of her 6 children, since 2 are married and living independently.  Their ages are between 33 and 14.  Only her youngest son still studies at night school and mornings he helps her in the house.  All her children work and help to pay household expenses, since she is 51 and separated for 15 years from her husband.\r\n   Mar\u00eda has worked for 31 years in the market selling fruits and vegetables in her stall on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  On other days, she does the same in another market, circulating in the P. selling everything between 6:00 am and 7:00 pm.  This activity has permitted her family to get ahead.  This is her first loan with the institution.  She was invited to join by her daughter-in-law.  With the funds she will buy citrus, melons, papayas, salt-wort, chicory, carrots, onions, tomatoes, and more fruits and vegetables to resupply her business.\r\n   Her dream is to have a house which she still lacks. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

So, from 6:00 until 8:00 in the morning she cooks in order to offer these new dishes to those who wish for something different on the menu than what she normally offers. Later it is paid for with the earnings. She also sells cakes and other sweets and in this way obtains additional income. She likes to cook and she is very happy with the rythym of her work, besides the fact that it is profitable. Her wish is to be recognized for her work in culinary arts, because she plans on making it her profession and her only means of support.

In addition, she acknowledges that she gets along well with the other members of her communal group.

","en":"Graciela is 48 years old. She lives in her own home with her daughter Pamela (20) and her grandson Cristopher (3). For the last two years, she has been selling socks and lingerie, but she has been a merchant for many years. Previously, she had a stall selling vegetables. She had to give this up  because she suffered from a disease that didn't allow her to exert herself very much physically and that job required picking up and arranging sacks.  This is why she decided on a job that was calmer and that she could do afternoons, since she also takes care of her grandson mornings. She works in the following way: she offers her merchandise door to door to her neighbors and friends. Later they order the clothes that they like. After a few days guaranteed, she brings the quantity and style that they have chosen and she makes a guaranteed sale. in the future she plans on having a convenience store in her house and her daughter will also help develop this project.

She lives alone with her daughter and new husband in her own home in a neighborhood in the south of Lima. \r\n\r\nShe runs her own business selling groceries and staples in a store built in the first floor of her house. She has run this business for 16 years. Since then she has attended to her every one of her customers with a lot of friendliness because without them she would not have been able to grow her inventory and her profits. For this reason she opens her store at 6am until late at night. When she leaves to buy merchandise, her daughter is in charge of selling beverages. She always hurries home because they do not like to leave the business closed.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to have her warehouse full of various products. She also would like to fix the cracks in the wall of her house that were caused by an earthquake. \r\n\r\nThis is her 6th loan cycle with MFP and she agrees to pay her account punctually.  As leader of the group, she will also encourage all of her colleagues to be punctual with their payments as well. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy various products to stock her warehouse and to buy construction materials to fix her house. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":512632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy products to stock her warehouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":444.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":468.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":486.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":511.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":534.81},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":553.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.4},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.17,"local_amount":444.2,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":451.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718212,"comment":null},{"amount":167.98,"local_amount":468.78,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":476.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751887,"comment":null},{"amount":174.4,"local_amount":486.69,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":494.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934343,"comment":null},{"amount":183.38,"local_amount":511.77,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":520.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673113,"comment":null},{"amount":191.64,"local_amount":534.81,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":543.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886941,"comment":null},{"amount":198.43,"local_amount":553.75,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":563.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153944,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-16T13:29:57Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188024,"name":"Mercedes De Los Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mercedes  se dedica a la venta de granos b\u00e1sicos, frutas y verdura inicia a ofertar la variedad de producto desde las 5:00am,  su tramo est\u00e1 ubicado en el mercado la terminal. \n\nEste cr\u00e9dito lo solicita para comprar producto al por mayor con el objetivo de obtener mayores ganancias con el fin de mejorar su nivel de vida y la de su familia.\nSe siente muy agradecida con el apoyo que le ha brindado Ceprodel pues inicio con venta de verdura y hoy en d\u00eda a logrado ampliar su negocio teniendo la venta de granos b\u00e1sico.\n","en":"Sra.
