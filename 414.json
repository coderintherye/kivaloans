She would like to use her loan to purchase more convenience goods to increase the turnover at her kiosk.\r\n\r\nUmut has been in this business for ten years. Currently, she is living with her 36-year-old son and his wife.

Zhumabubu plans to use the loan to buy livestock.\r\n\r\nLike Umut, Azina N. sells convenience goods in a kiosk near her house.

Azina will also use her loan to purchase convenience goods to increase her turnover. She dreams of someday going to a resort.\r\n\r\nTashbubu T. is a retired 69-year-old, but she sells milk to earn more money. She began selling milk twenty years ago. She started with 10,000 KGS and, through her profits, was able to marry off her first grandson. She has two children who live separately with their families, yet some of her grandchildren live with her. Tashbubu is also a widow and plans to use the loan to purchase farm animals to increase the number of livestock she owns.

He is single and 27, and his parents remained in  Nyaruguru where they are farmers and raise cattle and their son Alfred's goats. Alfred finished primary level in school. \r\n\r\nHis business is motorcycle transport. Instead of taking a car as a taxi, people in a hurry in Kigali take a motorcycle taxi which is a very rapid means of transport. He has four years of experience in this business. He began in 2006, renting a motorcycle on a daily basis. When he joined a motorcycle drivers' cooperative, he was able to ask for an ACB loan which he has already paid off, and now he owns his own motorcycle. \r\n\r\nWith ACB he has entered into four loans and has paid off three, which enabled him to become economically independent, as he already has his own motorcycle. Today he is taking out a loan for 400,000 Rwandan Francs to repair his motorcycle by buying spare parts for it: a tank, two tires, two springs, and a piston ring, and paying the cost of a new driving license so that he can comfortably continue his work. His ambition is to reimburse his loan in a timely manner so that the Bank will accord him a big loan to buy a car to use as a taxi. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he intends to have his own house since he is presently renting, and also have his own car as well as getting married so as to have children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":554005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"buying spare parts to repair his motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kicukiro-Kigali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T07:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":202650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159577523,"comment":null},{"amount":350,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":202650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T18:07:30Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207577,"name":"Jovia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

As is the case with any competitive business environment, 53 year old M. Clement cites his relatively low prices as his winning stock in trade. In a week, Clement says he makes profits to the tune of 50,000.\r\n\r\nThis married father of eight children has evidently worked hard to take firm root as seen in the array of goods he has on offer in contrast to what his competitors have.

reputation for being a stickler for hard work in his charcoal-selling business. For a decade, M. David, a happily married, sturdy and affable gentleman, has blazed an enterprising trail not only for himself, but also for his fellow upstart business colleagues.\r\n\r\nDavid has been testimony to the fact that, with a strong sense of determination, one\u2019s plans cannot be thrown out of gear. His business has also benefitted a lot from his strong pro-activeness and robust customer relationship skills. As a result, he has established for himself a firm niche in the local market.\r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s dream is to open up other outlets in surrounding villages and parishes so as to solidify his financial base. Given his large-scale distribution transactions over these years of operating, he anticipates this will come to pass.\r\n\r\nIn a week, as a result of his diligence, David makes profits totaling up to 60,000 shillings and he is upbeat that, with this loan, his financial prospects for the future are bright. He wants to buy more bags of charcoal.\r\n\r\nWith this business, all David\u2019s five children have basked in the glow of a good education and the family\u2019s welfare has also improved a great deal.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":554026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more bags of charcoal to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kayunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 32.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-15T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Didas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amuza","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yakubu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2200000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550000},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550000},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":550000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689347,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903496,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296969,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467264,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T19:51:06Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207598,"name":"Kou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. K. is a middle-aged woman whose husband appears in the photo here.

He is married and lives with his wife and two children. The older is five and the younger six months. His instructional level is primary school. He is a salaried employee of a construction company based in Kigali. He is a workman in that company. Since where he lives is a bit rural, he grows sorghum, beans, and manioc, used to feed the family, and as for his wife, she oversees the farming.\r\n\r\nJean Paul has had more than 10 loans from ACB and with these loans, he has bought a house. The prior loans have allowed him to become economically independent. Today, he is taking out a loan of 320,000 Rwandan Francs to repair his house, kitchen, and toilet by buying sand, cement, two interior doors for his house and kitchen, then to build a roof and pavement, in order to maintain the value of his house and to make it strong, so that he can comfortably continue his work, as he puts it. His ambition is to reimburse his loan in a timely manner so that the Bank will accord him a big loan to use to buy a cow who will produce offspring to raise, and milk and manure. \r\n\r\nIn the future he hopes to improve living conditions for his family (put his children in school and feed them and his wife well). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Today, for the first time, he is requesting a loan of 1500 USD from Al Majmoua, a Kiva partner, in order to purchase tools for his work, as well as to change the d\u00e9cor of his house by purchasing a new couch and a washing machine. \r\n\r\nHoussein decided on doing his business because he learned it when he was young. Thanks to his long experience, he was able to build networking, and his clients, who are people from his region, mainly his friends and neighbors, feel comfortable repairing their cars at his garage. Hussein is trustworthy in his work. He hopes for the future, to keep on improving his work and always provide the best for his family.

is a 41-year-old motorcycle \u201cboda boda\u201d driver.  \"Boda bodas\" are privately owned motorcycles used extensively throughout Kenya for public transportation. Boda boda drivers pick up and drop off pay-as-you-go passengers as a motorcycle taxi.  Emmanuel operates from the municipal business center, where there is a constant flow of customers, and he has been in this business for 1 year.  \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is married and has 4 children, 3 boys and 1 girl, from 8 to 15 years old. The primary business challenges he faces are stiff competition from competitors with more than one motorcycle plus regular breakdowns of his motorbike.   His wife is a tailor\/dressmaker, a business Emmanuel was involved in before driving his motorcycle.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel plans to use the 60,000 Kenyan Shilling loan to purchase a second motorcycle.  He has successfully repaid three previous loans of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 Shillings.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Emmanuel hopes to buy his own land and build a home.  In 5 years, he dreams of having at least five motorcycles operating as boda bodas and being involved in the taxi business.\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as hard-working, humble, and humorous.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":749.58,"image":{"id":554098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

B., 44 years old, is from the city of Tagbilaran. She is married and has eight school-aged children. Her husband is a carpenter and a Barangay Official. To make a living, Celerina owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. She has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately $115 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nCelerina joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Celerina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase feed and baby pigs to raise and sell in the future. This will be her 2nd loan from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

The couple has been managing their own variety store for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nMarifi has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her variety store.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 25,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more products to be incorporated into her current product inventory.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.

She is married to Lucien Zannou, a plumber, and is the mother of four children, all of whom go to school. The couple takes care of three other children in addition to their own. The family has been living since three years ago in the Dogoudou district of Allada. Virginie helps her husband and takes care of providing for the family together with him. Virginie attended only primary. For about a dozen years her main business activity has been selling charcoal at the Allada market. She stocks up in Allada as well. Virginie is an old-time client of ALID\u00e9, having obtained and duly reimbursed three loans in the past. The number of her customer grows day by day and she can no longer meet the demand. Thus, to expand her activity and better satisfy her customers\u2019 demand, Virginie is seeking a fourth loan from ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva

is 35; he lives with his wife and 3 children. For more than 18 years he has been involved in agricultural activities. He hires workers to work the land and finds help from his family with handling the money produced from the sales. \r\n\r\nLately, Nazirdjon has expanded into raising livestock, which he also sells. He buys young cattle and cows, and when they are grown and heavy, he sells them. The only thing that Nazirdjon is suffering from now is the lack of water and that is the reason that he applied to IMON for purchasing necessary materials to make a borehole. \r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Nazirdjon has requested a loan through IMON International; he has good references from his neighbors who consider him a responsible person.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Hasifa is, in the opinion of her close acquaintances, a go-getter at every business she embarks on.

Her business has made enormous headway as a result of her enterprising nature, diligence and good human relationship skills. She has won laurels from most of her friends due to her determination to succeed in the face of seasonal financial adversities.\r\n\r\nFor this 28-year-old married mother of five, \u201chard work pays\u201d is an adage that she has highly valued and that, she says, describes her attitude. She began this business with no prior business experience and she started off with only 100,000 shillings. At length, she has established herself and currently her weekly profits are in the range of 20-25,000 shillings.\r\n\r\nHasifa holds her five children so dear. For that reason, she says, she owes it to herself and to them to give them the best education that good schools around the country can provide. With this loan, Hasifa wants to purchase and restock her shop with more bales of clothes that she reckons will bring in more customers and consequently improve her financial

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Norboy has been in the farming business for eight years. It is through farming that he is able to provide for the needs of his family, including his wife and son and also his parents. Norboy would like to request a loan of 7,000 Somoni, which he can use to buy necessary farm inputs like seeds and fertilizers, since they are very expensive. He is very optimistic that this amount will improve his yield and he hopes to have a continuous partnership with the lenders. Norboy always makes sure that he respects the people around him since he believes that respect begets respect.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. is a married woman who lives in Jingjang Village, Brgy. Alimango, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business venture as an Avon Cosmetics Dealer.  \r\n\r\nHer husband, Francis B., is 30 years old and works as a laborer to earn his living. They have no children.\r\n\r\nVictoria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Victoria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty through hard work. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP which increased the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th loan cycle, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP which she intends to use to to improve her business so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements. \r\n\r\nVictoria B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

L. is a 33-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store business.  She lives in Brgy. Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She earns an average income of 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Ruby is now borrowing PHP 20,000 for home improvement.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Ruby aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000 - uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to pay for the franchise of a vehicle that will be used for business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nLiberty D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

L. is a 39-year-old married woman who lives in Brgy. Novallas, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a general store and electronic reloading business. Her husband, Cipriano, is a 46-year-old farmer and they have no children.\r\n\r\nDelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,000 PHP from her business activities.\r\n\r\nDelia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 15th loan cycle, the amount of 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use on her general store and electronic reloading business.

She says that agriculture is not only useful as a source of income but also as a source of food for all the family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":554679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase organic fertiliser","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":234.57,"local_amount":234.57,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":234.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657843,"comment":null},{"amount":232.09,"local_amount":232.09,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":232.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479241,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":83.34,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221642432,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250744485,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T05:09:41Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207932,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene S. is a 43 year old married woman who supports her family by operating 3 business ventures: general store, Buy & Sell and piggery businesses.

In his time off he helps her with her food stand by waiting on her customers.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing these jobs for three years.  She says that what she likes the most is making purchases according to her observations about her customers\u2019 needs, brands, and prices.
