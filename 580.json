She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional waste and junk material to sell. \r\n\r\nMerlina is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase used bottles and newspapers to sell. This will be her 9th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

The fact that she operates a dairy business is known to the whole neighborhood, so there is usually a constant flow of customers. An initial capital of 20,000 KGS was loaned by a local bank, and the family repaid it successfully. Now it generates $83 monthly, but it\u2019s not enough to purchase calves for fattening. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Gulnara applied for a loan from Kiva. She is confident in every member of her group and believes in a high commitment in repaying the loan successfully. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Micro-finance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Being a resident of the northern town of Karabalta, Batmakan raised three children, the oldest of whom is 18 years old.

Soon she used the daily milk yield to produce sour cream, butter, and cheese. A homemade product raises demand in local area residents, who are pleased with accessible prices and good quality. For the distribution of milk, Batmakan uses her husband\u2019s help, because he is employed in the transportation of food products. Her children make a small contribution to the family business by providing their minor help after school. \r\n\r\nA monthly income of about $214 helped the couple purchase an automobile and several cows. Now Batmakan sometimes buys ready milk products and resells them in a local market. In order to accomplish this she has applied for this loan. Batmakan has deep hopes for her children\u2019s future.

She moved here 15 years ago. Her husband operates a business selling animals. He buys young animals, raises them and sells them to his customers. His business grows busier during the Muslim festival of Eid-ul-Azha because people purchase animals to slaughter. At other times, he sells animals to butchers. \r\n\r\nKaneez is a housewife who stays at home and does her household responsibilities. She is very active and tries to do her duties with responsibility. She has given birth to two sons. Her eldest son left his education after matriculation and started working as a salesman. Her youngest son is 17 years old and illiterate. He stays at home. \r\n\r\nKaneez has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. He wants to buy some goats and sheep to sell for profit. He has been doing this business for the past 15 years and Kaneez is confident that after the investment, her husband\u2019s business will grow further and make him even more money every month. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application. She has established a good credit record with her previous loan and never missed any meeting. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a raised hand is Kaneez fatima. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":777.14,"image":{"id":751309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy goats & sheep for animal-selling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Pakpattan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.35 73.4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-04-16T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kaneez Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khursheed Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Munawara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":70000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.71,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211170085,"comment":null},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452828,"comment":null},{"amount":77.71,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616783,"comment":null},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985912,"comment":null},{"amount":77.71,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744757,"comment":null},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549242,"comment":null},{"amount":77.71,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244508039,"comment":null},{"amount":77.71,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715715,"comment":null},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118616,"comment":null},{"amount":77.71,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6548.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243652,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T18:08:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":290581,"name":"Byambasuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Byambasuren is 44 years old and lives with his two children and his wife in Darkhan, the third largest city in Mongolia.

Twenty years ago the family was in a desperate economic state, experiencing great difficulty in covering basic living costs. The development of microfinance in Kyrgyzstan pulled her out of this situation when Olmaskhan received a loan in 1991 to start up a business. Purchasing  potatoes seeds which she then planted on her small piece of land, she achieved a rich fall harvest. <p>\r\n\r\nAgriculture has helped the family improve its living conditions, buy an automobile, and increase the number of cattle the family owns. A monthly income of 6,000 soms, however, is not always sufficient to cover all costs, so Olmaskhan is now requesting a loan from Kiva to pay for the services of a tractor driver and other operating expenses. Olmaskhan hopes to get enough profit so that she can give a good education to her daughter. <p>\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<p>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

I. lives in the village of Buknari, Guria Region. He is 54 years old, married and lives with his wife and son. Omar, Rezo\u2019s son, is 26 years old. He graduated from high school and now wants to continue learning and get a Master\u2019s degree. Rezo\u2019s family can\u2019t afford Omar's studies, and they decided to get credit and expand their agricultural farm, to increase their income. \r\n\r\nRezo has four milk cows and four calves. He sells 80 kg cheese per month. The cheese is sold in Chokhatauri (a nearby town). Along with the dairy farm, the family runs a bee-keeping business; they have 13 bee-hives and sell 250 kg honey per year.

The income of the family comes from their small agricultural farm, where Khatuna and Vaja work hard during the whole day. In particular, the family has three milk cows. The milk is used to make cheese \u2013 60 kg per month is sold in a nearby town. They have two pigs, whose piglets are sold locally. In their 500 sq. meter greenhouse, Khatuna and Vaja grow cucumbers \u2013 approximately 3 tones of cucumbers are sold annually. Also, the family uses their plot of land to grow maize. Most of the harvested corn is used for the farm, to feed the pigs and piglets. The total average monthly profit from all the above mentioned activities amounts to 800 laris per month.\r\n\r\nThe requested funding will be used to replace the old damaged cellophane in the greenhouse with a new one, as well as for fertilizing the ground there. After fertilizing and installing new cellophane, the harvest of cucumbers and the income from their sales will increase by 25%. Another part of the loan will be used for cultivation of the land, where maize will be sown. It will increase the harvest and sale of corn by 50%. \r\n\r\nThe increase in their income will be used for renovations to their house, in order to improve the living conditions for the family

Never having attended school on account of social reasons, she started early on to sell various products such as \"atiek\u00e9\" (a couscous-like dish made with cassava), brooms, and other items imported from Ivory Coast.\r\n\r\nShe's been running this business for more than 35 years, and has acquired a large clientele and a good reputation. Her strength is her affordable pricing : she's always XOF 100 (ca US$ 0.20) less expensive than other sellers. In order to bolster her working capital and meet customer demand, she turns to  Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso. She's been a customer for 54 months, and after 3 individual and 3 group loans, she's now seeking her fourth loan.\r\n\r\nShe intends to use it to buy one ton of atiek\u00e9. She gets her supplies in Abidjan and resells for cash and on credit, to a clientele comprising mostly women.

U.'s Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, is pleased to present to you teachers of the RC Primary School, Kagomgbeh village, near Makeni city.  RC Primary School, Kagomgbeh, was founded in 1980 by the Roman Catholic Mission to meet the educational needs of the children of Kagomgbeh village. RC Primary School has a staff of 7 teachers and an enrollment of 221 pupils. This school is the only school in the community. \r\n\r\nSchool staff came to SMT to apply for loans so that they could accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nJohn U. S. is the head teacher at the school and leader of this group. The 47 year-old John was born in Binkolo village, about 7 miles from Makeni. He has been in the teaching profession for 26 years now.

A. is a focused and active single man. He is from Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  From childhood he has been interested in agriculture, and today he is engaged in animal husbandry. He sells cattle in the market located in Vahdat city.  Every week he purchases cattle for 1500 to 1700 Somoni and sells them for 1800 to 2000 Somoni. He has been in this business for 3 years. Besides that, he also sells vegetables and milk.  Anvarshoh would like to get a loan of 7000 Somoni to expand his business.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells at retail and wholesale, for cash and credit, to a mostly female clientele. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, the members expect to earn a monthly profit of 25,000 FCFA, which will be used to cover the children\u2019s health care expenses and school fees. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":751543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase charcoal and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Diouti\u00e8bougou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-04-16T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gn\u00e9ba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tDiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tTe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tNagnouma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tMariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":43447.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301508,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":43447.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581089,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":43447.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750844,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":43447.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120151,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":43447.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882024,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":43447.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699124,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T16:04:50Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":290716,"name":"Giyosiddin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This school was opened in 1973 by the Roman Catholic Mission to educate the children of Lunsar and it environs. Presently, the school has 15 teachers and 636 pupils.   \r\n<br>This is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other school staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n<br>Alpha P. B., aged 58, is a teacher at the school and leader of this group. Born in Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital city, Alpha now lives and works in Lunsar. He has been in the teaching profession for 38 years now. He is a widower and has seven children \u2013 five adults and two attending secondary schools. Mr B. has requested this loan from Kiva lenders in order to buy house-building materials. Your loan will go a long way in helping Alpha build a dwelling house, as he is in dire need of a house for his family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":751811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy house-building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Lunsar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2011-04-16T10:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alpha P.

Ahmadiyya Primary School in Lunsar, a town in northern Sierra Leone. This school was founded in 1960 by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission. The school is currently staffed with nine teachers and has an enrollment of 326 pupils. This is the first loan from Kiva lenders from which teachers of this institution have benefited. \r\n\r\nAbu B. B. is a teacher at the school and the leader of this group. The 49-year-old Abu was born in the township of Lunsar. He has been in the teaching profession for twenty-one years now. Abu is married and has two children who are in college. Abu is requesting a loan of 1,200,000 SLL in order to pay college fees and buy school learning materials for his children in college. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish some certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children, while others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n

C. is from Dipolog City.

Elma has been involved in her business for over two years, and she earns approximately 4,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) a month from the business. She also maintains a rice field.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation, and her ability to engage in business activities. She successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP. Elma is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers and pesticides for her rice field. This will be the third loan taken out by Elma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":343,"image":{"id":750575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Andrea N.'s Group.\r\n\r\nAndrea is married. To make a living, Andrea owns and operates a tricycle transport service. (A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached passenger cab.) Andrea has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Andrea joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Andrea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase tires and other accessories. \r\n\r\nAndrea is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to repair her vehicle for better service. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Andrea from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is single and has 2 children: Angel Adair, who is 6 months old, and Kevin Jesus, who is 4. She sells lingerie and fashion jewelry for a living. She has requested this loan in order to purchase bras, camisoles, panties, undergarments for boys and girls, twin bead ponytail holders, headbands, etc. She started this business a year ago with the money that she had from a tanda--a rotating savings and credit association, which is a popular form of saving money in Mexico. She started out selling gelatin, then decided to launch a lingerie business. This business is very important because she supports her family with it. She feels very proud of her work and of her good customer service. Furthermore, she is able to take care of her children with this business. She wants to expand her business by selling baby clothes, and she plans on doing so with the profits from the lingerie sales. She hopes that her children grow up without want, and dreams that she can give them either a plot of land or a property, as well as a good education. The members of this group would like to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad that they are grateful for allowing them the opportunity to launch a business.

She resides in a 2-room brick house with her family in the area of Mian Pind. She moved here 15 years ago. She is 39 years old, married to M. J., and has six sons. Her three elder sons do different kind of work while younger ones are enrolled in a local school and are getting their education. \r\n\r\nTasleem herself is an active and a responsible person by nature. She stays at home and carries out her responsibilities as a housewife very well. She makes the utmost effort to provide comfort to her family by fulfilling their needs. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a vegetable vendor. He put the vegetables on his cart and visits different streets of the city to sell them. Tasleem has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the further expansion of her husband\u2019s vegetable selling business. Using the loan, he will buy fresh seasonal vegetables for sale. He will also repair his cart because it has rotted in some areas which don\u2019t carry vegetables. \r\n\r\nTasleem hopes that this investment will bring positive changes to her husband\u2019s business and his monthly income will grow up.  She is a new loan user and this is her first loan application with Asasah. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady raising her hand is Tasleem. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":778.17,"image":{"id":752807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fresh seasonal vegetables and repair his cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Faisalabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.416667 73.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-04-18T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tasleem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parveen Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haleema Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":71000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.82,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211170109,"comment":null},{"amount":77.81,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452852,"comment":null},{"amount":77.82,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616807,"comment":null},{"amount":77.82,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985936,"comment":null},{"amount":77.81,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744781,"comment":null},{"amount":77.82,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549266,"comment":null},{"amount":77.82,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244508063,"comment":null},{"amount":77.82,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715739,"comment":null},{"amount":77.81,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118640,"comment":null},{"amount":77.82,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243676,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-21T13:09:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
