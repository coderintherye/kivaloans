Now, Ni Luh Kanten is optimistic with the business, and hopes that the business will be able to change their economic condition, as well as to support the the education for her children.\r\n<p><b>Translated form Indonesian by Hestyana DK, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDari dua ekor ternak babi yang di beli seharga Rp. 200.000,- \/ ekornya Ni Luh Kanten memulai usahanya. Dari pemeliharaan sistem tradisional (mengikat babi di bawah pohon ) hingga kini telah memiliki sebuah kandang yang semi permanen. Harga bibit babi dan pakan ternak yang mahal sempat membuat Ni Luh Kanten bingung dan mengosongkan kandangnya dan hal itu sangat berdampak pada perekonomian keluarga yang hanya bertumpu pada pendapatan suaminya yang berprofesi sebagai buruh.\r\nUntuk mengatasi hal tersebut, akhirnya berkat dorongan dari Ketut Sernen, suaminya, saat ini Niluh Kanten mulai lagi mengisi kandangnya dengan ternak babi baru dengan menggunakan dana pinjaman dari Dinari. Dana yang didapatnya dibelikannya 4 ekor bibit babi yang masing-masing seharga Rp. 300.000.- sedangkan sisa uangnya di belikan pakan ternak seperti dedak padi, dedak gandum dan konsentrat. Ni Luh Kanten kini merasa sangat optimis dengan usaha yang dijalankan saat ini dan berharap modal yang di berikan ini akan bisa mengubah dan memperbaiki perekonomian keluarganya yang sempat terpuruk dan juga untuk biaya pendidikan anaknya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":194668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase piglets and fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-31T12:30:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Luh Kanten","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-14T14:05:06Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":1166666.66,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1230575.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308555,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":1166666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-03T09:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1230575.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849778,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":1166666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1230575.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080613,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-31T14:05:06Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":62140,"name":"Mrs. Soam Mach Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Soam M. is the leader of this four member group in Phum Thom Village in Kandal Province.

Agueda invited her neighbors to an information session in her home and the group formed very quickly.  The Progress Group is located in the city of Capiata. <p>\r\n\r\nThe group members are very appreciative of the loan and are a very strong group.  They are very faithful women who all participate in their weekly meetings in order to collect funds to pay back the loan. <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, the group participates in big activities to collect funds since one of their group members has fallen ill, so they have come together to help her finance the costs of treating her sickness.  The group shows significant solidarity and sympathy always helping each other.  The group consists of 17 hard-working women that works in a variety of activities. <p>\r\n\r\nThe Progress Group stands out as an excellent group as they have a record of zero late payments.  They will use the loan to help them in such activities as: the sale of cleaning products, cosmetics, notions, food, chickens, charcoal, clothing, and fabrics for making clothing. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl Grupo denominado El Progreso se conform\u00f3 mediante la actitud emprendedora de la Sra.

Magburaka Boys School is the oldest secondary school in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone. Several of the country's dignitaries passed through this school. When the Revolutionary United Front Rebels seized the town in 1997, they made the school as one of their camps. Before they left, the previous boarding school was totally mutilated and vandalized. Teachers, pupils, matrons and all fled the campus, leaving it a ghost town. However, with a peace treaty between the government and rebels in 2002 and with subsequent remobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, life began again in the township of Magburaka. Schools reopened, but the Boys School reopened only to find a well-mutilated and vandalized school, with most of its former teachers not willing to come back. Only some of the few teachers were willing to come back and face the challenge of lifting Magburaka Boys School to its former height once again. It's a difficult task, in a country where most qualified teachers are fleeing to seek greener pastures overseas, where teachers' salaries are low, and in a country where textbooks are difficult to come by. But they are determined to bring the Boys School back to its former glory.\r\n\r\nTo keep themselves from having to flee like other Sierra Leoneans, most of these teachers, especially the younger ones, also engage in some other trades to supplement the meager salaries they receive from government. Thus, they need a loan to enable them to promote their businesses. Others will give their loans to their wives to invest in businesses. Some will use the loan to purchase building materials, others will use it to purchase pieces of furniture, and a few of them will want to pay school fees and other related charges for their children and dependants. \r\n\r\nHere is an introduction to these teachers:  Hassan M. C., for this purpose the group leader, is 32, and was born in Kambia Northern Sierra Leone. He is single with no children. He will invest his loan in his business as he did with his previous loan. This time, Hassan expects to buy 10 bartars (5 gallons makes a bartar) of palm oil. Although during his first loan, he experienced several hiccups such as bad roads to market places, and business colleagues not adhering to deadlines, Hassan said he will be able to overcome these challenges with this loan. He also said that the previous loan helped him a lot, as he was able to pay for his junior brother's school fees and at the same time feed his perents.\r\n\r\nOther members of the group include:   Edward C.

is a young woman, 33 years old, married, and is involved with the selling of dried fruits. She has a college education. In 2004 she began to be involved in this type of business. She sells dried fruit in a large assortment:dried apricots, raisins, Greek walnuts, almonds, pistachios etc. She sells her products at a local market (Caxovat) in the city of Dyshanbi, and she buys the products in bulk from whole sale suppliers from Xydzhanda. Soon there will be a post with connections to Yrazoi, and at this time there is a high demand for dried fruit. Recently she has heard from her friends that a lot of businesses increase commodity-circulation with the help of loans.Therefore with this goal in mind, she has made the decision to receive a loan in the sum of $12,000 to buy products in bulk and increase commodity circulation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva

The majority of the members live with large traditional families in the administrative quarter Markala, one of the prefectures of S\u00e9gou, the fourth largest administrative region of Mali. \r\nThe group Djidja has businesses that sell various items: condiments, plastic products, cereals, fabrics and shoes.  This group consists of relatives, neighbors and friends and has, after having learned of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso on a documentary that aired on national television, been taking out loans for two years. This is the group\u2019s third group loan and the group has successfully paid back all previous loans.\r\nThey plan to use the loan to purchase four pieces of fabrics, three sacks of millet, a parcel of shoes, a significant amount of condiments and plastic buckets.  They will buy the fabrics, shoes and buckets from wholesalers in S\u00e9gou and at the market of Bamako, the capital of Mali. On the other hand, the condiments and cereals will be purchased in Markala, Niono, Dougabougou and Seribala from producers from the area that are irrigated by the Office du Niger.  The products are sold for cash and sometimes for credit, in the markets in the different districts of Markala (Diamarabougou and Kirango) and at the village fair in Sansanding.

All of the preceding ones have been correctly repaid.  They intend to use this loan to buy:  100 kg of fresh fish, 3 sacks of peanuts, and a sizable quantity of condiments.  They get their supplies of fish from fishermen on the banks of the Niger River in Markala;  their condiments are from vendors coming from the Sikasso region and from neighboring villages;  their grain is from vendors of the marketplaces of N., Dougabougou, Boussin et Sansanding.  The condiments and grain are sold retail for cash locally in Markala and in neighboring villages.  Sometimes sales are made on credit at the marketplaces of Diamarabougou, Kirango et Sansanding.  The fresh fish is sold to hotel owners who come from big cities, such as S\u00e9gou et Bamako.  \r\n\r\nThey each hope to realize a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA, which will serve to  increase operating capital, to cover the loan interest, and to provide for family needs.
