Pepe y toda su familia viven en un hogar propio en la comunidad nativa Palomar, en el distrito de R\u00edo Negro, provincia de Satipo. Desde peque\u00f1o Pepe se vio rodeado de cafetales y otras plantas en las parcelas de cultivos de sus padres. Ahora se dedica a la agricultura y con gran destreza cultiva caf\u00e9, cacao, pl\u00e1tanos y ma\u00edz. Cuenta con 3 cuadras de terrenos, en ellos distribuye sus sembr\u00edos de sus productos. \nLe gusta lo que hace, ya que el trabajo en el campo es m\u00e1s libre y obtiene ingresos de acuerdo a como se desenvuelve y como negocia sus frutos.\nPara eso tiene que trasladar su producci\u00f3n hacia la ciudad de Pichanaki. Ah\u00ed ya lo conocen por sus buenos productos y por lo a\u00f1os que lleva en el negocio. Lo que m\u00e1s vende es el cacao y el caf\u00e9. Los precios de estos productos casi siempre se mantienen y si bajan, no es mucho. Por el contrario, el ma\u00edz y pl\u00e1tanos tienden a bajar de precios en temporadas indeterminadas. \u00c9sta ser\u00eda la segunda vez que Pepe acceder\u00eda a un pr\u00e9stamo de MFP, por eso se compromete a ser puntual en el pago de las cuotas. \u00c9l pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLos Kontonas de Palomar\u201d, y se siente a gusto de formar parte del grupo.

Pepe and his family live together in their own home, in the indigenous community of Palomar, in R\u00edo Negro district, in Satipo province.  Since he was a young boy, Pepe has been surrounded by coffee plantations and other plants growing on his parents' farmland.  Now he farms himself and, with great skill, he grows coffee, cacao, bananas and corn.  He has three 'cuadras' (measurement of agricultural land) on which he sows his crops.\r\n\r\nPepe enjoys what he does as farm work is less restricting and he makes income according to how he manages his business and how well he negotiates the sale of his crops.  He has to transport his produce to the city of Pichanaki where he is already well known for his good produce and for the number of years he has been in the business.  What he sells the most of is cacao and coffee.  The prices for these products almost always remain stable and if they do fall it isn't by much.  On the other hand, the price of corn and bananas falls during some seasons.  \r\n\r\nThis will be the second time that Pepe has requested a loan from MFP and so he pledges to be punctual in making his repayments.  He belongs to the \"Los Kontonas de Palomar\" community bank and feels happy to be a member.  He will invest his loan money in paying staff or laborers who he will hire to get rid of the crops that stunt the growth and sprouting of his fruit and grains."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T11:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T11:00:03Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pepe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-21T17:58:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391048,"name":"Carmita Georgina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela Las Orqu\u00eddeas  de la ciudad de Portoviejo se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas el Banco Comunal 5 De Noviembre, esta ciudad se la conoce desde hace mucho con el nombre de Ciudad Del Valle por estar rodeada de muchos cerros lo cual brinda un atractivo sin igual.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Carmita, tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen tres hijos de 16, 9 y 3 a\u00f1os de edad, la mayor estudia en colegio y el siguiente en escuela.

She has developed her work in sewing over the last four years. This is a business that she chose out of passion.

She has two children aged 16 and 12, who are attending secondary school.  She and her children live in a rented apartment in  Tarma district.  Carmen shows courage and hard work; she has worked since she was a young girl.  She began by baking cakes which she sold door-to-door.  At a later point, she started buying and selling cheese, natural yogurt and blancmange.  Eight years ago, she started selling products from catalogs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Carmen is a women who never rests.  Her sales of products from catalogs are what drive her finances.  \"I offer products from different catalogs, and the orders that I get each month keep me covered for my basic expenses and more\", she says.  What she sells most are cosmetics, perfumes, and jewelry.  Clothing, shoes and other accessories have seasons where they raise their prices, but she shows that she always has sales.\r\n\r\nBetween the cakes, the dairy products and the catalog items, she is able to ensure that her goals can be reached, but she is hoping for more.  With her effort and dedication, she is thinking about acquiring her own home, which is one of her most longed-for goals.\r\n\r\nCarmen will be taking out her 13th loan from MFP, and agrees to be punctual with her monthly repayments.  \"GS-006\" is the name of her communal bank, which she is happy and identifies with, because her colleagues have the same objectives.

She also sells directly for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Maria Nena is requesting a loan for 14,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Nena hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.

She is married to Rodolfo, her business partner and father to her two children. Together with her husband, Maria Corazon manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaria Corazon operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Corazon hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week; there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":53.33,"image":{"id":1006741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Corazon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275540,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T22:01:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392630,"name":"Lien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lien is 44 years old with two children who are grown.

She has 4 children, of whom only one is dependent on her; the rest work on their own.  She lives with her husband in a rural area of Olmos named \u201cFiloque Grande\u201d, which is only a few minutes from the district of Olmos and approximately 2 hours from the city of Lambayeque.\r\n\r\nBecause Clara is a hard-working woman who fights to meet her goals, over time, she has managed to save money she obtained from her previous work in farming.  She bought two moto taxis with the money she saved, and now rents them out to transport passengers from town to town.  This work generates her income on a daily basis and she projects that, over time, she will purchase two more vehicles, which is something she is already working towards.\r\n\r\nHer husband, like her, is committed to the goal of succeeding, which is why he works independently as a master builder throughout the zone where they live.  With this work, he also earns weekly income for the household.\r\n\r\nIn the past few days, Clara has met with some inconveniences not only related to the infrastructure of her house, but also the failure of one of her vehicle\u2019s engines.  For these reasons, she has felt it necessary to turn to Edpyme Alternative to request a loan in the amount of 3,000 Peruvian soles.  She will use the funds to buy construction materials and also a new engine for her vehicle, so she can continue her work in a normal manner.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1004093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"buy motorcycle replacement parts and construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Olmos - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":206.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":223.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":228.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":238.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":239.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":255.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":261.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":267.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":279.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":287.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":294.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T23:54:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392699,"name":"Editha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Editha is 51 years old, married and has 7 children, 2 of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nEditha is in the agricultural business raising pigs in the Philippines.

This place is known for its delicious sweets that the locals prepare and that are recognized throughout the country.\r\n\r\nTeresa, who is 55 years old, lives in this place.  Several years ago, her husband passed away, but she had two children from that relationship.  They are now older in age.  She has a 17-year-old grandson in her care who is like her son.  He studies at the high school.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-fighting woman, who in order to get ahead, continued on her own with the business that her husband had for many years.  It is a small factory where she makes and sells snacks.  She works every day from 6 in the morning making snacks with the help of two other people who she pays a weekly salary and later with the help of her grandson.  She makes sure to deliver to diners and stores in the area.  Also, she prepares food, but she does this in the afternoons and evenings since she only prepares snacks.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of plantains, oil, rice, meat, and other supplies for making snacks and other foods.  She is a founding member of the Communal Bank, and she likes it because the interest rates are very low and because of the help that she receives with the loans.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to to have a small business with machines and a truck to deliver to other places."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":165.63,"image":{"id":639825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"buy plantains, oil, rice, meat, and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Rocafuerte","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1320,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":165.63,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":165.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263319413,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T04:15:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392683,"name":"Mitsubishi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ester is in her late forties and is married with four children who are still going to school.

a single parent with one child. Currently she is living in her parents' home in the rural settlement of San Alfredo Vilca Aguilar, some ten minutes from Tambogrande, which is part of Piura province, which is located some three hours from the city of Chiclayo. Because Nelly lives in a rural area, she still does not have basic potable water service, and for now only has electricity.\r\n\r\nWith her parents' help, Nelly succeeded in completing a technical degree in nursing. Now in the house where she lives she has set up a place, where from Monday to Sunday, she does medical consultations, and at the same time sells medicines (pharmacy) which are the most commonly used, or most requested by the local people. \r\n\r\nThe work she does is very important in the area, due to the fact that it is not easy to find a doctor or places where they sell medicines used in primary care.\r\n\r\nNelly wishes to establish her business both in the sale of medicines, and in infrastructure for her clinic, so she needs working capital. That is why she is applying to Edpyme for a loan in the amount of 1,500 nuevos soles, with which she will be able to meet her objectives. \r\n\r\nNelly is a young professional thanks to her parents' help, so she is interested in paying back their efforts by working responsibly, and so improving not only her parents' quality of life, but also that of her child."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1004101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To buy medicines and construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":106.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":114.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":115.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":121.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":128.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":136.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":139.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":143.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":147.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T00:32:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392686,"name":"Batirhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batirhan is 54 years old and lives with his wife and two kids in a ger (Mongolian yurt) in Bayan-Ulgii province in western Mongolia.

They live throughout the parish of Cumbe, in Cuenca, where they can enjoy the great pastures of livestock farms, old estates, and estates of modern construction, which, without having the charm of traditional architecture, are not altogether out of place but rather give variety to the landscape. Its people maintain the traditions and culture of their towns. \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Juana, who is 42 years old. She is divorced from her husband, but has four children from her marriage. Three are married and live independently.

She lives comfortably in her parents' home with Eli, who works and is the father of her 8-year-old son. She makes a living in transportation with a moto-taxi business. She started with a family loan three years ago and pays it back on a daily basis. In this way she has kept the business growing and now has three moto-taxis. She counts on the support of her partner, who helps administer the vehicles. She likes the business because it generates income and she feels productive supporting Eli with household expenses. On the other hand, she doesn't like it when it rains a lot because it makes the roads difficult and the moto-taxis go slower. She has plans of adding another business, like opening a shop for spare parts. This will be her fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she awaits your collaboration so she can solidify her plans. She enjoys being part of her community bank because it is a united group. With the money she is requesting, she plans to invest in the purchase of spare parts like tires, motor oil and other items to maintain her vehicles."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":84.92,"image":{"id":1004248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase tires and motor oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":221.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":239.98},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":239.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":257.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":267.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":274.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.92,"local_amount":221.53,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":227.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386535,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-21T20:11:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392739,"name":"Mt.livingstone Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima, who is in her mid 30s, is married with one small child.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.   Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her business, Aida is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan.  She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAida hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":160,"image":{"id":1006894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6822.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T09:50:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392754,"name":"Dannis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dannis is a 25-year-old gentleman from Migori County, west of Kenya and is married to Susan.

is a student applying for a loan to pay tuition fees to help her finish her undergraduate degree at Strathmore University and this is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Seraphine. I am currently a third year student at Strathmore University pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Hospitality Management. I have been performing well at Strathmore University with my second year transcript showing an average grade of A. \r\n\r\nI come from a single parent family with my father being the sole breadwinner. He is a small-scale businessman working in the transport sector in Nairobi. I have four siblings who are still in school. This puts an even greater strain on my family's finances, as I am the firstborn.\r\n\r\nI also make time to volunteer at a local charity's children\u2019s home. The experience helps to further develop my interpersonal skills as well as giving me an opportunity to give back to society.

I happen to be the only one in my family fortunate enough to attend university \u2013 the others' dreams for the same were never realized due to financial constraints that terminated their education as early as primary school. \r\n\r\nI am currently a second year student pursuing a Bachelor of Business Information Technology degree. The courses revolve around computers and I depend entirely on the university computer labs to do the IT projects. The projects are really demanding and require constant contact with computers, even during the weekends when it is not possible to utilize the labs as other classes are also held there.\r\n\r\nMy efforts to solicit funds to purchase a laptop have been rendered futile; thus, I have decided to apply for a loan. The laptop will go a long way in assisting my studies, as notes will always be available and I will be able to complete projects on time. My laptop will also be available to church youths for educational movies during the long holidays. It will enable me to leave nothing pending in my academic life and ensure I graduate in the stipulated time. After graduation, I will venture into teaching to disseminate the knowledge and life skills I have gained in life, after which I will pursue a Master's.

I am the first born in a family of seven children, four of whom are in high school and two in primary school. I am currently in the third year of my studies, pursuing a degree course in Hospitality Management at Strathmore University. I have faced a lot of difficulties paying my school fees since I joined Strathmore in 2009. I come from a humble background as my parents are not in any formal employment. My dad is a local welder and my mother is a peasant farmer. I have always depended on donors and well-wishers to pay for my school fees and even to pay for my younger brothers in high school. \r\n\r\nI am a bright student who has always maintained a top position in class. I have a lot of dreams and aspirations to help other bright but needy students access quality education and be the persons they want to be in the future. It is in this regard that I am kindly applying for this loan so as to enable me to complete my degree studies. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to thank the Kiva organization for this initiative, which I count as a blessing; more so at this time when I had almost lost hope in my education due to my financial constraints. Strathmore University has always been, and will forever be, the best educational institution due to the codes of conduct that it instills in its students. The institution enables people to develop virtues and be responsible members of society once they leave campus. \r\n\r\nIn particular, studying at Strathmore has enabled me to acquire the moral virtues required of an honest and responsible citizen. This has been made possible through the units that are taught: for example, Principles of Ethics, Theology, Social and Political Philosophy, and Philosophical Anthropology among others. The dress code has also enabled me to act and carry myself in a professional manner at all times. All these qualities and culture are very rare in most public and private universities in Kenya.\r\n\r\nAfter my graduation, I aspire to come up with a small business entrepreneurship, probably in the hotel industry, or get some employment which will not only enable me to pay back my loan, but will also give me an opportunity to help bright and needy students access higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1006213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for tuition fees in order to complete an undergraduate course in Bachelor of Tourism Management","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":218,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":246200,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":9848},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9848}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T03:46:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392430,"name":"Erick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erick is a student applying for a loan to pay for his tuition fees to help finish his undergraduate degree at Strathmore University and this is his story:\r\n\r\nI am Erick, the fourth born child in a family of five children.

","en":"Ayub has been a client in the organization for nine years. He has three sons, one of whom is currently working in Russia. Ayub managed to expand the family business over the years. Despite his age Ayub still buys the livestock, but it is his son who raises the animals. Every morning Ayub's son takes the cows out to pasture, and in the evening he brings the animals back to the pen and gives them hay and feed. Ayub was interested in livestock fattening from an early age, and that's what he taught his sons. \r\nAyub has nine grandchildren, and he is a lively grandfather. His wife is a homemaker. Together with her daughters-in-law, she produces goat yarn and sends it over to Russia for her son to sell since it is in high demand there.  Ayub would like to take another loan to buy a couple of dairy cows while the market prices for the animals are low.

Her dream is to one day be able to have a poultry business.\n\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"Gongo La Mboto One\" which has a total of 15 members who will hold each other accountable for paying back their loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1008786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy powdered soap and more bars of soap.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yustom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suzana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magreth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwajabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rashid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Said","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":3480000,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":217500},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":217500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":217500,"processed_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":217662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263432208,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":217500,"processed_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":217662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263432209,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T17:45:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392784,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice has a common-law husband with 3 children.

The group's members mainly work in farming and livestock raising.  Two years ago they decided to come together so that they could access loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir.  They have used these loans to improve their financial situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sonia.  She is 40 years old, married, and has three children who are 16, 13 and 4 years old.  Her two oldest children are in high school.  Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nSonia and her husband both farm.  During the winter season they grow corn, peanuts and certain vegetables.  They also grow passion fruit year round as these are  long-cycle crops.  Right now they are focusing on their corn and peanut crops as they require the most protection from pests.

is Jacinta, 50, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Celestino, a steel man, and is a mother to her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nJacinta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJacinta hopes her business grows more in the coming year and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

They have five children, but only four of the children live with them.  The whole family lives in their own house in Sana Clara in the Huasahuasi-Tarma district.\r\n\r\nViviana has been farming for 20 years.  Her life centers around the care of her fields as that is where she spends the greater part of the day.  Her primary crops are different varieties of potatoes.  She is known for her charisma in marketing. She sells her products at the central market in the city of Tarma, thanks to her good disposition while making sales.\r\n\r\nOne of her main problems is the \u201crancha\u201d (a type of fungus) that affects her crops.  There are also other diseases, but these do not discourage her.  Later she wants to buy her own fields for farming.  This would minimize her costs.\r\n\r\nHer children are her priority, and the greater part of her income is for their education.  Thanks to the support of her communal bank, she can not only take on her projects, but she can also give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis time she will plant 40 sacks of potato seeds.  To do so she will need to pay the rent for the land.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cTrabajemos Unidos\u201d (Let\u2019s Work Together) communal bank.

She pays for them to be transported to Lima but the cost is offset by successful sales.

In order to help her husband with their household expenses she set aside a space in her house several years ago and, using the little money she had, she started a grocery store.  This has enabled her to provide for the family as her husband earns very little from his agricultural work.  Narcisa works every day, from 6.00am to 8.00pm, and sometimes until later.  Her husband and son help her in her work when they have any free time.  She has been in this business for ten years and it has enabled her to pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\nNarcisa will use this loan to further stock her store.  She will buy rice, sugar, oil, detergents, cold meats and other essentials.  She has been a member of her community bank from the beginning and she is its president.

Her business is collecting disposable materials such as plastic bottles and materials made of bronze, aluminum, and copper that people no longer need. In her house she opened a recycling shop where people bring the things that they don't need so that Geovana can buy them, and then she sells wholesale to the retailers who come with their trucks to transport them to the city of Lima, the capital of the country. But, as she is very resourceful, she set up a CD shop in her house where she sells CDs of singers and beauty products by catalog. In this way she obtains extra money. In addition, her husband travels weekly to various cities in the interior of the country to sell clothing wholesale. She belongs to the communal bank \"Mujeres Solidarias\" (united women) and this is her first loan with MFP, where she is happy to know that she will have financial support to advance with her business.
