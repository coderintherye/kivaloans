Roberta J. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Roberta, 67, reached high school and is a widow with six children. Five are already working and one lives at home. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nRoberta presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store, in which she sells items that are needed daily by neighbors in her community. Products on her shelves range from soap bars to candies and from energy drinks to rice. Having been at least 25 years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most importantly, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of PHP 9,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching.  Roberta plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.\r\n\r\nRoberta's life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life.

Esta es una peque\u00f1a ciudad costera en la que a principio del siglo veinte funcion\u00f3 el m\u00e1s importante puerto mar\u00edtimo del pa\u00eds. La microempresaria es peluquera de profesi\u00f3n y durante muchos a\u00f1os trabaj\u00f3 en varios salones de est\u00e9tica. Hace cinco a\u00f1os su esposo, que era vendedor en un almac\u00e9n de electrodom\u00e9sticos, perdi\u00f3 su empleo y fue ah\u00ed cuando naci\u00f3 la idea de crear su propio negocio. En un principio el surtido de v\u00edveres era peque\u00f1o, pero con el paso del tiempo fue mejorando, al igual que la adquisici\u00f3n de vitrinas, estantes y refrigeradores. Hoy en d\u00eda la se\u00f1ora Janeth alterna su oficio de tendera con el servicio a domicilio de peluquera. Este es el tercer cr\u00e9dito que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y su primer Credikiva que planea invertirlo en la compra de v\u00edveres en general, siempre se ha distinguido por su excelente puntualidad. El negocio tiene un volumen mensual de ventas de $ 5.000.000 COP y el margen promedio de utilidad es del 20%. La se\u00f1ora Janeth planea para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o alquilar un local m\u00e1s grande para trasladar la tienda y adecuar el sistema de autoservicio. Ella manifiesta que disfruta mucho su actividad de tendera porque le permite estar en permanente contacto con los vecinos de su comunidad, por lo cual, su mayor satisfacci\u00f3n no es la utilidad econ\u00f3mica que le genera su microempresa, sino el aprecio que le dispensan todos sus clientes.","en":"Janeth A. F. has a store in the town of Puerto Colombia.  This is a small coastal town which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was home to the most important shipping port in the country.  This small businesswoman is a hairdresser by profession and, over many years, she worked in several beauty salons.  Five years ago her husband, who was a salesman in an electrical appliance store, lost his job and this was when the idea to create her own business was born.\r\n\r\nAt first, the store was not very well stocked with foodstuffs but, over time, it improved.  Janeth also acquired display cases, shelves and refrigerators.  Now she divides her time between her trade as a shopkeeper and her hairdressing services which she offers in people's homes.\r\n\r\nThis is Janeth's third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to invest the money in buying general foodstuffs.  She has always been noted for her excellent punctuality.  Her business has a monthly sales volume of 5,000,000 Colombian pesos and her average profit margin is 20%.  Janeth plans, next year, to rent larger premises so that she can transfer her store and adapt the self-service system.  She says that she enjoys her business as a shopkeeper a lot because it allows her to be in permanent contact with the neighbors in her community.  Her greatest satisfaction is not the money that her small business makes but rather the appreciation that her customers all show her."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":830.55,"image":{"id":667122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Faced with her recent and untimely death, he had to take over her business.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that he lives in an area which is mainly made up of farmers and craftspeople, H\u00e9ctor decided to work selling foodstuffs.  Most of his customers are peasants who work in nearby districts and do their shopping every week.  Almost all his sales are made for cash and this allows him to sell at lowers prices.  His average daily sales amount to 400,000 Colombian pesos and his average profit margin is 15%.\r\n\r\nThis is H\u00e9ctor's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest the money in buying foodstuffs wholesale.  In the not-so-distant future this small businessman plans to convert his business into a supermarket to provide his customers with more convenience.  H\u00e9ctor combines his work with his studies and, because he is the eldest brother, he drives home to his siblings the need for them to get training in order to become good citizens.\r\n\r\nWhat H\u00e9ctor likes most about his work is the permanent contact with people who visit his business, some of whom are good friends.  He dreams of becoming a professional and being able to help the poorest children in his town as a way of honoring his mother's memory as his mother was a very generous lady."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":673185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy foodstuffs wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Bolivar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-12-21T23:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector Anibal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2100000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":146577},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":160119},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163188},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166316},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169504},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":172753},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":176064},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":179438},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":182878},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":186383},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":189955},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":206825}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.48},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.79},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.99},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76.78,"local_amount":146577,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":147660.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427756,"comment":null},{"amount":83.87,"local_amount":160119,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":161302.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001179,"comment":null},{"amount":85.48,"local_amount":163188,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":164394.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289200,"comment":null},{"amount":87.12,"local_amount":166316,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":167545.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157342,"comment":null},{"amount":179.28,"local_amount":342257,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":344786.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509219,"comment":null},{"amount":98.17,"local_amount":187419,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":188804.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673440,"comment":null},{"amount":101.96,"local_amount":194655,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":196093.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319999,"comment":null},{"amount":101.43,"local_amount":193642,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":195073.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614237,"comment":null},{"amount":225.53,"local_amount":430560,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":433742.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568222,"comment":null},{"amount":60.38,"local_amount":115267,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":116118.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779569,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-25T01:10:18Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260263,"name":"Mariateresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Claribel lives with her husband and has 3 children between the ages of 15 and 18.  Her income, along with her husband's, has been able to support her household and her family.  \r\n\r\nSince she was a young girl from the town of Bellavista in the department of Magdalena, she has had to work.  In the beginning she stayed with her aunt and worked as a domestic employee until she was 24 years old.  Now, 20 years later, she knows that all this was a great experience that forged her character so that she would be able to venture into business for herself. Her first business was making cheese, whey, butter and bollo [a tamale like dish] in remembrance of her homeland.    She prepares the most delicious dairy products served with amasijos D. ma\u00edz [corn tortillas].  Lastly, she finished setting up her small restaurant when she was able to buy a house and establish it there.  For the comfort of her customers she has tables and chairs and recently, she has been considering buying a heated case that costs $340,000 COP because she sells 50 lunches and 200 fried items daily.  Also, she needs large quantities of raw materials because she knows that her sales will increase at the end of the year.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 15th loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that has supported her from her humble beginnings, as much at the business level through the loans she has received, as through the training that has helped her immensely.  She says that this is the business that she has dreamed of, but every day she wants to strengthen it so that she can continue supporting her children's education.  Her dream is to take vacations with her husband to the San Andres Islands, a beautiful place where the beach, the breeze and the sea will allow her to rest her body and mind and will be a second honeymoon at 44 years old.

Thanks to his hard work and dedication, he has a restaurant in his house (in the community of Corcona). He asked for the loan from EDAPROSPO to buy more merchandise, or ingredients, to prepare food. He does his work with the purpose of creating employment. F.' dream is for all of his children to have a profession and to have the best restaurant in the area where he lives. The members are very grateful for the opportunity of the program. They are serious and responsible at their jobs.

E. is a widow who lives in Purok Tan-ao, Brgy Lopez Jaena, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating a buy and sell of ready-to-wear clothes business and a general store.  She has four children who are 32 to 38 years old. Luz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luz has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store and ready-to-wear clothes businesses so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements.  Luz E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buying and selling tobacco and a motorcycle transport business. Her husband, Anastacio, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's businesses. They have eight children aged between 21 and 42. \r\n<br>Monica joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Monica has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 9,000 PHP, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing  30,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her tobacco business and maintenance for her motorcycle so that she could continue to save up for future business improvements. Monica L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b> About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Mary Jane has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 3000 PHP per month from these activities.\nIn 2010, Mary Jane joined Kiva partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Mary Jane is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her 2nd from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marisol is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from ASKI.

Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He was 26 years old, when he married and moved to Kyrgystan.\r\n\r\nUsing the money he had earned, Abdibait bought a house and rented land for cultivating crops. With the revenues from this activity, he bought a crushing machine and started his business of producing combined feed. He sells his products at the local market and supplies his loyal customers in neighbouring villages. In order to broaden his business and purchase crops for planting, he obtained his first loan from Bai Tushum, which was repaid without any delays.\r\n\r\nAbdibait plans to use this loan of 80,000 Kyrgyz Soms to purchase 10 tonnes of barley and 4 tonnes of corn. It will allow him to resell combined feed from these products in winter at higher prices. In the future, Abdibait is planning to give a higher education to his children and build a house for his family. Being a very purposeful and positive person, Abdibait works hard to support his family.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She lives with her two children and her husband in an area of Alajuela that has been supported by institutions such as the 'Instituto Mixto de Ayuda Social' with the goal of improving residents' quality of life.  Seven years ago, under her own initiative, Mar\u00eda set up her business selling clothes and other articles.  Over the years and thanks to her own hard work, she has grown in her business, meeting other needs of her customers, buying electrical appliances from Golfito free port.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's main priority is to support her children in their studies.  At the same time, Mar\u00eda herself is taking some distance-learning courses so that she can finish her high school education.  She has just passed her seventh year.  This has helped her to improve her business and she hopes, in the short term, that she will be able to obtain her high school diploma.  This is Mar\u00eda's first loan.  A friend recommended that she approach Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer when she heard about the institution on a radio program.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda started her business with a loan of 25,000 colones that she received from her aunt.  With this money she bought underwear and set up her business.  Her capital has gone around and she has diversified the range of products that she offers to her customers.  She currently makes catalog sales and travels to Golfito to buy electrical appliances which she sells on credit.\r\n\r\nWe have performed a credit report on the client and verified the different business activities that she carries out.  She shows the ability to make her repayments on time.  She is also planning to use her loan money to travel to Panama where she will buy merchandise (mainly clothes) at a very good price, thereby strengthening her working capital for other activities.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has small premises in her home where she keeps a small inventory of products.  She works there in the mornings after having got her children ready for school.  In the afternoons, she displays her products in nearby towns which has helped her to increase her customer base.  She provides her customers with credit facilities.  Mar\u00eda's activities support her household financially, together with the money her husband makes from his work.

Maria Elena is president of the Board of Directors, Sra. Margarita is treasurer, and Sra. Sonia is secretary. Many of the women note that they already have experience taking out loans as they have been members of Kiva partner Pro Mujer for several years. They stopped when they no longer needed financial assistance, but now they have seen the need for money to give a boost to their businesses or to buy some new tools.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Elena Q., president of the Awati\u00f1as Community Bank, who has been a member for eighteen loan cycles. Her job is washing sand. She explains that a river runs through the area where she lives. During the rainy season it carries a lot of sand. Mar\u00eda and several other people from the neighbourhood have permits for certain locations on the banks of the river where they can wash the sand.

Her other children work and one has his own family.\r\n\r\nMari's activity is raising calves. She is going to use her loan to pay two two corn fields of grass that they rented. They occupy the fields to give food to their animals. She also wants to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nMari tells us that one of the difficulties of the months from April until September is feeding her animals since she doesn't have land and it is the rainy season. What she does is pay a monthly rent for each animal so they can eat the pasture and the others can go to a farm that is near the community.\r\n\r\nMari's wish is to be able to have a space for her animals like land to farm and not to buy the corn field which is expensive. She also wants to be able to guard the animals. Mari also says that when she sells an animal, it's cheap. Her goal is to sell them at a good price so she gets something back for her investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4875,"image":{"id":673328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase food and raise animals (calves) to sell.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-22T19:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":4875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":609.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":609.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1218.75,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15057.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430758,"comment":null},{"amount":1218.75,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15057.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850017,"comment":null},{"amount":1828.13,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":22585.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292290,"comment":null},{"amount":609.37,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7528.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160558,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-23T01:20:38Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260544,"name":"Dominique","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominique owns a business that sells soft drinks.
