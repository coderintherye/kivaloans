am Arshad B.. I live in the small semi-urban town of Raiwind in Pakistan. I am married and have two boys. I live with my family in a one-room brick house.

From the beginning of her business she has raised male pigs, but because that has only produced enough income to barely cover operational costs. Expanding her business to include raising sows will allow her to better meet the needs of her family.  By purchasing one breeding-age sow for the price of 800,000 Rupiah, within six months she believes she can earn 2,500,000 Rupiah from selling the 10 piglets the sow produces.  With the income she makes from selling the piglets, she will be able to send her three children to school and their family can move out of a semi-permanent home into their own house.  Ni Komang Wirani's husband works at a minimum wage job and also feels this undertaking would be beneficial to their family. He plans to help her handle the business when he is not at work.  She would like to go forward with her idea for this big undertaking, but she is limited by a lack of capita because this type of business takes time to produce a profit.  This is why she would like to borrow capital to purchase a breeding-age sow and the feed it will need.  She is very optimistic that her business will take off because she will be able to afford to raise more sows as her income increases.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Courtenay Teska Race, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nPengalaman  menjalankan usaha beternak babi selama beberapa tahun membuat Ni Komang Wirani semakin pintar dalam mengelola usahanya ini.

He currently has two children, Intan and Noval, and his income is what ensures their survival.  In 2002, the Bali bombings almost completely destroyed the Balinese economy.  One of the hardest-hit industries was tourism.  After the bombings, hotels had to lay off many of their employees. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances, I Putu Agus Sumerta was let go from his job at a hotel in Denpasar.  Like many others, he had to return to his home village to begin looking for a new source of income.  He decided to go into the clothes tailoring business.  To learn the trade, he studied with his mother, at the home where he was born, in the village of Candikusuma.  With a completely manual sewing machine (they have no electricity), he is now able to make a full outfit worth 40,000 Rupiah in just one 8am to 5pm work day.  He has been very successful in his business, gaining more customers every day.  For major holidays he has lines of customers waiting to put in orders.  In fact, due to the limitations of the tools he is using, he is having to decline more and more customers because he is afraid he won't be able to complete their orders on time.  I Putus Agus Sumerta would like to borrow 2,000,000 Rupiah to purchase a Dynamo electric generator that he can attach to his sewing machine to increase his production and therefore better help his family meet their day-to-day needs.  His oldest daughter is in her final year of primary school, and he also wants to use his increased income to pay for her continued education.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Courtenay Teska Race, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSebagai Kepala keluarga yang harus bertanggung jawab dalam memenuhi seluruh kebutuhan keluarganya , I Putu Agus Sumerta  yang kini telah di karuniai dua orang anak yakni Intan & Noval sangat memerlukan pekerjaan  yang bisa menjamin kelangsungan hidup keluarga. Hal itu sebenarnya sudah pernah terwujud ,sebelum suatu kejadian (Bom Bali )terjadi,yang membuat hampir seluruh perekonomian di bali terpuruk , khususnya dalam bidang perhotelan .Banyak hotel maupun usaha yang berkaitan dengan pariwisata mengalami kebangkrutan yang Berdampak pada pemutusan hubungan kerja. Seperti yang terjadi terhadap  Putu Agus Sumerta.Mantan seorang karyawan salah satu hotel di Denpasar ini harus rela balik kekampungnya dan harus memulai mencari sumber pendapatan  yang baru . Menjahit pakaian menjadi pilihan Putu Agus ,ketrampilan yang di peroleh dari Ibu kandungnya itu di jalankannya di rumah tempat kelahirannya yaitu di desa Candikusuma . Dengan mesin jahit manual (tanpa tenaga penggerak listrik) dalam sehari Putu Agus bisa menyelesaikan satu stel pakaian dengan ongkos\/upah sebesar Rp 40.000,- ini di kerjakan mulai jam 8 pagi sampai jam 5 sore.   Hasil jaritan Putu Agus Sangat baik sehingga pelangganyapun bertambah banyak lebih lebih menjelang hari raya banyak pelanggan yang  antri untuk di buatkan Baju maupun pakaian lainya . Bahkan tak jarang Putu agus harus menolak pesanan karena takut tak bisa menyelesaikan tepat waktu karena keterbatasan alat yang dimiliki.       \r\nPutu Agus memerlukan pinjaman modal dari Dinari sebesar Rp 2 .000.000,- untuk membeli Dinamo listrik yang dipasangkan pada mesinjahitnya sebagai tenaga pengerak Agar hasil produksinya meningkat dan pendapatannya juga bertambah Sehingga dapat  memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari dan juga untuk biaya pendidikan putri sulungnya yang sekarang sudah kelas 5

His wife explained that he fishes for two to three months of the year in the Tonle Bassac (river), a tributary of the nearby Mekong.  The remainder of the year he fishes in a nearby lake using locally made fish traps (again, see photo).  They are requesting this, their eighth loan from Maxima, to buy a cow and fish traps.  O.\u2019s wife said a trap costs 70,000 Riel (US $17.50).  She also said he can catch twenty kilos on a good day making about 50,000 Riel (US $12.50), depending on the types of fish he catches."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":96491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase one calf and buy fish traps.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Ta Khmao district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":61,"posted_date":"2007-12-12T03:15:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-26T11:17:02Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-01-26T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":122173,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-02-26T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":142571,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166534,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-04-26T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":192296,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219970,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249097,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277745,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307206,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338264,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":39,"local_amount":39,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372109,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for MAXIMA Mikroheranhvatho Co., Ltd. -

Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them.

I\u2019m sick of writing about kuku and Kiva lenders are probably sick of reading about them!\u201d Not understanding that I just wanted to vent and that it was a rhetorical question, one of the earnest young men from IT gave me a serious analysis of the reasons why so many of our clients choose to raise and sell chickens. Firstly, they require little start-up capital, you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising chickens is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but that was as deep as time would allow our analysis to go.<p>I imagine that some, if not all, of these factors encouraged Mboni M. to establish her kuku-raising business in 2005. She now requires a loan of $275 to purchase even more kuku and expand her business.

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<p>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

O., 38, is married with two children. Her primary business activity is a nursery school and a home care center. She started off with less than 10 children in 1998 and has since expanded to 60 children. She says that her main reason for starting the nursery\/baby care was because of her love for children and desire to see them grow and also for profit to take care of her family's needs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRose started off with a capital base of Ksh 5000\/= and has gradually ploughed back profits into her business over the years to allow her to reach to where she currently is. Her main challenge is lack of capital to cater to the increasing children seeking admission. This deficit is mainly in the learning facilities and feeding programme for the children. She thus intends to use the loan capital for this purpose while also using the profits from the business to help in meeting her family's needs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRose is the Chairman of the group she belongs to and she hopes to use her leadership skills acquired while managing the school to similarly ensure that the group remains cohesive to enable her to benefit from other loans in future. She has so far exhibited these leadership skills in marshalling the group together during the training sessions. Her business is in area called Muhoroni, almost 80 kilometres away from Kisumu town. This is the first loan she is taking with the Faida self help group but the training records from the loan officer indicate good attendance and participation by the group during group training sessions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":97505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To expand learning facilities and feeding programme for her nursery school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisumu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.1 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":92,"posted_date":"2007-12-14T07:35:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen Odhiambo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-28T16:51:19Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":245000,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":40833.33,"processed_date":"2008-01-28T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123500,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":650,"local_amount":40833.33,"processed_date":"2008-02-28T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":40885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143991,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":943,"local_amount":59239.74,"processed_date":"2008-07-30T19:42:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":59314.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281818,"comment":"Auto Reconciled"},{"amount":1499.89,"local_amount":94223.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T01:07:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-02T07:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94343.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335041,"comment":"Auto Reconciled"},{"amount":157.11,"local_amount":9869.74,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9882.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14881321,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-12-14T16:51:19Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:37:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":27531,"name":"Laura 2 Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Pascuala is married, has 3 children, and creates shawls, skirts, and napkins which she makes and then sells to the tourists that visit the city.

(Yes, I did double-check the name of the lending group, but I will leave it to you for the correct pronunciation.) Since Lugazi is in a very rural area, most of the members are in agriculture. Aisha is an exception. When I asked her what her business was she told me she was a \u201chawker\u201d. <p>\r\nOnce I understood what she was saying, I still had a problem with the word, since in my culture it is often deemed a business that has illegal connotations. But I did not want to change the word, since this is what she said, so let me clarify. A hawker is someone who sells there goods without the benefit of a fixed location. They therefore walk around busy markets and taxi parks carrying and selling their wares.  Aisha sells used clothing. This is not an easy job and most would like to be able to afford to rent a store front. There are many hawkers on the streets and they are seen as just as respectable as storefront owners, though not as well off. \r\n<p>\r\nAisha has been a hawker for two years and a member of her lending group for nine years, hence her position as chairperson. I got the feeling she has had a downturn in her life, but is determined to be able to rent a storefront. She is married and has three children. With her portion of the group loan, which is approximately $275 US, she plans to buy more used clothing to sell. The clothing is bought in Kampala and is bought in bags or bales. She is not allowed to see what is in the bags until after she purchases it, though she can determine if she wants t-shirts or shirts or skirts. There can be several hundred items in each bale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":97802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Aisha plans to use her loan to buy more bales of used clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2007-12-20T03:25:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hasifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hasifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwajuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:10Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6950000,"loan_amount":4100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1737500},{"due_date":"2008-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1737500},{"due_date":"2008-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1737500},{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1737500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":1737500,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-03T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1747625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127551,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":1025,"local_amount":1737500,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-03T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1747625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148293,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":1025,"local_amount":1737500,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-03T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1747625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172741,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":1025,"local_amount":1737500,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-03T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1747625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200077,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-20T22:05:10Z","paid_date":"2008-05-03T09:12:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":27586,"name":"Zoharan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I am a widow with nine children: seven sons and two daughters.

It took about an hour. We passed by many rural mud and twig huts, passing lots of children and lots of small individual plots of land. This is sustenance farming: plots that grow a few banana trees, with sweet potatoes between, some cassava, beans, a coffee plant, yams, etc. Most have no income, no job, but the land is fertile. Most have chickens but rarely can one afford a cow, pig or goat.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Milly\u2019s pride is her cow. Actually she has two cows. The one in the picture is old and gives less milk now. Conversations with neighbors tend to be about how your cow is doing and how much milk did you get yesterday, etc. Milly\u2019s daughter and her family live next to Milly. There are many children. We passed by a corral where a small child was resting under the shade. Milly told me that this was her granddaughter and that she had broken her leg three months ago. Her leg was twisted and allowed to heal in place.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milly wants to trade her old cow for a newer one that will produce more milk.

is a 26 year old shop keeper in Lugazi. He is married with 4 children and he cares for one orphan. He has had his business for 7 years and has been a member of his lending group for 3 years. In his shop he sells salt, paraffin, sugar, maize flour, soap and cosmetics. Most retail stores sell similar items. In poor areas the needs of villagers are simple and there is very little ability for luxury items.  As a store owner you would not want to take a risk by adding a \u201cnew\u201d item to your inventory, because the likelihood of it being sold would be small.

Bales would be like a gunny sack full or a wired bundle of hundreds of items of used clothing. She is not allowed to inspect, so she must know her contact. She will load up the bale, often strapped on the back of a matatoo, or taxi van, and head home. There she will sort and hang her clothes on a pole and head out to sell \u201con the street\u201d of her village.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Edith is getting older, she dreams of one day having enough money to pay the rent for a store front so that she can operate out of one place.

Group Loan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"You may not think that selling yellow bananas in a country where bananas grow everywhere and cost next to nothing would be a wise business decision, but then you have never seen the sight along the one of a kind roadside venue on the main road from Kenya to Kampala where Nanono is in competition with a least three dozen other women who sell only one thing to passerbys: yellow bananas.\r\n<p>\r\nHere\u2019s what happens. There is a constant stream of van taxis each carrying 14 passengers on this very busy and dangerous road. They all stop at this roadside pullover (the driver gets a free bunch of bananas for doing this). Immediately upon stopping, dozens of women attack the van with bunches of ripened bananas. They swarm around every window. The conductor, the man next to the sliding side door, opens it and bunches of banana are pressed into your face. You can buy a ripen bunch, say 14-20 in a bunch for 30 cents. The driver stops long enough to get his free bunch and enough for anyone to buy and off we go again down the road as the ladies back off and wait for the next taxi.\r\n<p>\r\nNow get this, Nanono who is 35, single with 6 children and cares for 4 orphans has been doing this for 15 years, supporting her family. She is the chairperson of the Najjembe Lending Group of which she has been a member for the past 7 years.

Here the Victoria Women\u2019s Lending Group meets weekly. This sleepy village with views of a multitude of islands can only be reached by a one hour drive on very rutted roads. As you come into town you are taken back by its beauty and its babies. If, as I\u2019m told, Uganda has one of the highest birthrates in the world, then Kiyinde is certainly doing its fair share in keeping that statistic. Remote villages tend to have high birthrates. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fishing is the main industry in Kiyinde and I think the men go fishing and the women run the place. That was certainly the feeling as I met with this dynamic group of women who are members of the Victoria Lending Group. They are a joy to be around.
