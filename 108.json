This is 43 year-old Anne M..  She is married, and has five children between ages  7 and 22. In 1998, Anne established her fire wood business. Working six days a week, and nine to twelve hours a day, she earns about US $260 every month from this business. She is assisted by her casual workers. Anne has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to buy a large amount of firewood. In the future, Anne plans to open another new business. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":173389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a large amount of firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-06-23T14:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne T.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-07T20:09:39Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":100300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":289038,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":319339,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":100300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351377,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":100300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347815,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":100300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970387,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-06-23T20:09:39Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":53727,"name":"Samnang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Samnang S. lives in Kngoak Pong Village in Kampong Chhnang Province.

She travels to make her purchases at least once a month which she orders by commission from the venders. Her customers find her upon her return to pick up their orders they have made with her previously. She is well known in her neighborhood because of her good marketing sense and above all by word of mouth between her customers.

around 1951 in Adjohoun in the district of Oueme, Mrs. Madeleine T. is a widow. To support herself, she sells bread but she as found her own niche in the market selling a specialty dish made of corn based dough which is then boiled to cook. The dish is called Akassa here in Benin. This local dough is especially appreciated by single people who don't lose any time in their schedules by having to take time to cook. This dough is very popular and so her original plan of selling primarily bread items has taken a back seat to this new endeavor. Madeleine has been a client of Alide since February 6, 2006 and she is a member of a solidarity group and this is her fifth request for a loan through this program. She is very much appreciated in her neighborhood because of her dedication to her profession despite her advanced years. <p>Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e vers 1951 \u00e0 Adjohoun dans le d\u00e9partement de l\u2019Ou\u00e9m\u00e9, dame T.

She is a member of the Nueva Vida (New Life) Communal Bank and is 48.  She studied up to the sixth grade and has four children.  She also cares for a niece who was orphaned.  Her husband is disabled due to injuries he received in a traffic accident many years ago.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, she works making women's clothing, such as various kinds of skirts and wool undergarments.  She sells her products from a stand in the 15 de Agosto Market in Yunguyo.  She decided to start this business because of her oldest son, who was studying at the Altiplano-Puno National University and couldn't afford what he needed for school, such as materials, etc.  In light of this, one of his school friends suggested that he learn to sew shawls by machine.  He told he mother about the idea and she immediately decided to buy a second-hand sewing machine.  Next, they both learned to make the shawls.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the time, Ms. Sabina only had two thirds of the money she needed to buy the sewing machine, so she went to Ms. Toribia Pilco to ask about getting a loan from the microfinance institute Manuela [Ramos].  She quickly decided to join her community's Communal Bank.  That's how she was granted her first loan of S\/. 300.00 nuevo soles [local currency], in order to pay for the sewing machine.  She is now seeking a loan of S\/. 500.00 in order to purchase different colored wools.  She will repay the loan in four months.\r\n<p>\r\nMs. Sabina is very happy at present, as all of her children have learned to sew.  This joint family effort has helped the family increase its income.  In the future, Ms. Sabina would like to buy more sewing machines and increase her business, becoming a successful businesswoman in the Yunguyo province.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Chegezy, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Sabina vive en la comunidad de Chambi Chocaque del distrito y provincia de Yunguyo y pertenece al Banco Comunal Nueva Vida, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta sexto de primaria y es madre de 4 hijos y es responsable de una sobrina huerfanita.

As such, those working in weaving are requesting loans to purchase more thread and fabric, while those working in agriculture and fruit and vegetable sales will use their credit to buy seeds and fertilizer.

Right now is planting season, so the sooner they get the loans the faster they can get their crops going.  \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIn addition to directly helping their businesses, the women hope that the loan will also enable them to save some money.

L. was born on January 1, 1980 in Ghana.  Married to Pierre DOSSOUGOUIN, a welder by profession, she is the mother of two children, who are both in school, in the 6th grade and in kindergarten, respectively.  Trained as a master hairdresser, Ms. Rosine L. used to practice her trade in a shop in Xwlacodji  behind the public primary school in that area, and she used to market cosmetics there, too.  But with the rarity of customers, she dedicated herself much more to selling these cosmetic products and moved towards the downtown, in the Sik\u00e8codji district, while still marketing cosmetics.  To do so, she came to apply for an initial loan of 30,000 francs CFA enabling her to stock enough supplies.  It was a very profitable experience because her capital accrued and the demand grew, such that she lacked, due to means, the merchandise to meet the demand.  The profit that she earns from this business enables her to support her family.  One loan after another, since the demand is ever-growing, she is presently requesting her fifth loan in the amount of 180,000 francs CFA in order to achieve these objectives.   \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nL.

She resides in the ENAGNON PLAGE district in AKPAKPADODOME (Cotonou) with her husband, Thomas ADODO, a motorbike taxi driver in the city of COTONOU.  In the beginning, Ms. Anna A. used to sell staple foods and had operating funds of about 40,000 francs CFA.  To buy her merchandise, she used to go to AZOVE in the Mono but wasn't able to create a large enough inventory due to her limited means.  She then came to obtain an initial loan of 50,000 francs CFA to grow her capital.  From there, she added to her business the sale of condiments, since after the initial loan, her operating capital increased.  With the experience she acquired with regards to commerce, and because of growing demands from customers, she is presently requesting a third loan of 100,000 francs.  With these funds, she is thinking of again diversifying her business by buying, in Lom\u00e9 in Togo, children's clothing for distribution, which is also going to enable her to find other types of customers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nA.

For her first loan in 2006 she obtained the sum of CFA 30,000 and so far she has proved to be reliable. Given the growing number of requests for mattresses, she wants to increase production. To do so, she wants to buy 20 bags of cotton fiber and have a reserve of CFA 20,000. However, Mrs. A. lacks the financial means to achieve her goals and is asking for her fourth loan in an amount of CFA 120,000.\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>A.

She began her business out of the desire to work, get ahead, and be an independent person. She wants her own income so that she can offer a better future to her children since her husband's salary sometimes is not enough. Her children are already in school and her daughter Cristina was born with a disability. She had to buy special medicines and provide therapies that ended up being expensive.

S. is 32 years old. She is married and she has four children. Her husband is a farmer. From a very young age, she has understood and recognized the value of hard work because she has had to deal with very difficult circumstances and various hardships in her life. Muhtaram is an extremely hard-working woman, and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration, and she has always looked to provide extra income for the benefit of her family. <p>\r\nFor approximately 8 years, she has been in the business of purchasing young cattle from the local market and fattening them up so that they can be sold in the local markets. More specifically, she wakes up very early each morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and thereafter selling them at the highest price possible at the local market. She started this occupation after her beloved aunt had recommended it and taught her about the business. Thanks to this activity, she is able to support her children so that they receive a good education.

I. is 26 years old. She is married and she has two kids. Her husband is a taxi driver. Nigora\u2019s kids are small now but she and her husband work extremely hard to ensure that her children will have a bright future and will receive a good education. <p>\r\nShe sells the national dresses and trousers for women, and also \u201cSherozi,\u201d which is used to decorate the national dresses and trousers. Nigora purchases high-quality goods and sells such goods at reasonable prices because her clients merely have average levels of income. As a very nice and friendly woman by nature, Nigora does her best to satisfy her clients in such a way that they will be repeat customers. She notes that her business is stable and thus allows her to contribute considerably to her family's budget. <p>\r\nNow, Nigora would like to purchase more modern styles of the national dresses, trousers, and \u201cSherozi\u201d in order to increase the range of goods she sells.

She is a married woman with 6 children, the youngest being 6 and the oldest 18, all of whom are in school. Teo has been operating her shop for 7 years and finds business to be fair.<p>\r\n\r\nIn order to make clothes for both men and women, Teo rides a matatu (a shared van) into Kampala to buy textiles and then returns to the store she rents to do the tailoring. She serves an average of 5 customers a day and with the revenues from the tailor shop has been able to open a bar in which she sells beer and soda.<p>\r\n\r\nTeo got her first loan from MCDT 4 years ago and has successfully paid back 8 loans. By working with MCDT, she has been able to sell more clothes because she can get more materials to serve more customers. In addition, she has expanded to making uniforms for a local elementary school, The Red Star School. This success has not come without difficulties, as some people do not pay on time for the clothes she has made or sometimes do not pay at all, making it difficult to predict and rely on a steady cash flow.<p>\r\n\r\nDue to the proceeds she has garnered thus far, Teo has been able to sustain her family and send all her children to school. With this loan, she hopes to get a step closer to her future goals of expanding her businesses and buying a new plot of land for her house.<p>\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Ruth N., who sells old clothes; Hamida N., who owns and runs a salon; Robina Nabosa, who sells charcoal; and Miriam M., who sells raw food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":174204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To stock more materials to make clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-07-04T03:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-18T17:24:44Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2400000,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":258.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":259,"local_amount":401032.26,"processed_date":"2008-08-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":406759.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300145,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":259,"local_amount":401032.26,"processed_date":"2008-09-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":406759.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":330845,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":259,"local_amount":401032.26,"processed_date":"2008-10-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-23T07:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":406759.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364931,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":256.33,"local_amount":396903.22,"processed_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":402571.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334419,"comment":null},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:32Z","rounded_local_amount":405712.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955614,"comment":null},{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":405712.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14875985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-04T17:24:44Z","paid_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54006,"name":"Dy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Dy S., 42, earns around $5 per day by making rice wine and raising pigs, Her husband, Mr.Houn Hoeurn, 46, is a soldier.

She is 54 years old and divorced with 5 children. The children are 33, 28, 25, 23, and 19 years old. The youngest child is in school, while the 4 older children are past school age. The community she lives and works in is urban and is a slum within a low-lying area that floods in the rainy season.<p>\r\n\r\nAnnet goes to the village to purchase and cut down maize and matoke (green, non-sweet bananas that are a main part of the diet in Uganda). She then roasts the maize and sells that and the matoke on the roadside.

More specifically, she is planning to purchase additional merchandise, such as cleaning liquids and powders, polishes, drain cleaners, shampoos, disinfectants, air fresheners, and laundry products, in order to attract more customers and to thereby increase her business' sales. She firmly believes that increased funding will facilitate her business' ongoing success and will allow her to continue to improve the quality of life for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":174343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To diversify her product line by purchasing additional inventory to thereby attract more customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Zaporozhye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-06-24T12:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ganna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-09T22:21:59Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":837.21,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":841.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277512,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":180,"local_amount":837.21,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":841.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":306986,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":180,"local_amount":837.21,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:38:31Z","rounded_local_amount":841.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338037,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":176.66,"local_amount":821.69,"processed_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":825.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323113,"comment":null},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":837.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9942445,"comment":null},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":837.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14866097,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-06-25T22:21:59Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T13:02:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54077,"name":"Ludmila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ludmila is an entrepreneur from Zaporozhye.

Right now, she travels each Thursday to the nearby city of Santiago to buy shirts, pants, skirts, and blouses to sell in the streets of her local community, Amistad, which means friendship.  Monise plans to continue selling clothes in the afternoon while she attends school in the mornings.  \r\n<p>\r\nMonise I. is just one member of the 15-person micro-bank, Movimiento Mujeres de Amistad, which means Women's Movement for Friendship.

The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting, as the others members gladly help cover one another\u2019s payments in order to receive their next loan together.
