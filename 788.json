Her group is located in the Samana province of the Dominican Republic and is composed of 15 micro-entrepreuners. She lives in a simple home structure with her two children and her long-term partner. Yanna said her most difficult challenge has been to complete her university studies and raise and educate her children. She enjoys ironing their clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is Yanna's sixth loan with Esperanza. She started her business with the first loan she received from Esperanza International, around three years ago. She plans to use this loan to purchase a glass cabinet and different pairs of shoes.

They are, on average, 40 years old and have 5 children each.  They live in the village of Bounou Markala, in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative district of Mali).  \r\nThe members of the group sell millet cakes, pastries, various grocery products (such as tea, candy, cigarettes, matchboxes etc.) as well as tubers and soap.\r\nIn order to increase their business, they have joined the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  This is their first solidarity loan.  Mawa, sitting at the far right in the photo, prepares and sells millet cakes.  She intends to use her loan to buy 3 bags of millet.  She buys millet at the Konodimini market.  To make a millet cake, millet has to be crushed, the husk is removed, then the millet is washed with water and ready to be ground.  The flour obtained is mixed with simple water and other ingredients such as sugar and yeast.  The obtained dough is then fried in oil and is ready to be sold.  Mawa sells her millet cakes from home.  She sells for retail and for cash, and sometimes on credit, to customers of both genders and all ages.  With this loan, Mawa hopes to see average monthly profits reach 15,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in the activity and used to provide for her family.  \r\nLike the other women of the group, her goal is to have a multifunctional mill in the village, which would make the tasks of shelling and milling grains much less tiresome.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1008949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy millet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bounou Markala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-18T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-19T09:10:03Z","loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadji     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawa   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yama   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seli     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T11:38:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394077,"name":"Nasiba","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Nasiba 48 letnaya vdova s odnim rebenkom.

She applied earlier for her first Kiva loan and was able to buy raw materials and supplies that she used to make her beautiful handcrafts, so her working capital increased slightly.\r\n\r\nSince that loan went very well for her, Noreidis ventured to take out a new Kiva loan. She will use this one to buy thread and appliqu\u00e9s to make the bags and backpacks that have been ordered. This guarantees rapid sales and another increase in her working capital, as well as her customers' loyalty.\r\n\r\nNoreidis wants to send a message to Kiva's lenders: \"The loans have helped me a lot. With my profits, I have been able to make home repairs. I have also changed my way of life, and I've paid off my debts.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert about four hours south of Lima, the capital of the country and is acclaimed by Peruvians as \u201cThe Land of the Sun.\u201d It is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (a 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus and olives and perhaps above all as the source of the traditional Peruvian drink, Pisco.\n\nWe find the client\u2019s house and business in this hot, arid climate. As is well known Peru is characterized as having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Alejandro enjoys a great deal is \u201cArroz Chaufa\u201d. He studied until the fifth year of secondary school and he would have liked to study to be a teacher. He is the father of a 5 year old boy who is just beginning school.\n\nAlejandro works as a motor taxi driver. He works 12 hours a day and has about 60 customers a day. He believes that his business is doing well because he provides good service and above all he is honest in his dealings.\n\nAlejandro is very grateful for Kiva loans since thanks to the support he has received he will be able to buy spare tires for his vehicle. The loan will also enable him to make necessary repairs even though it is a bit inconvenient. Thus he will be able to continue fighting to realize his great dream: \u201cHaving his own home.\u201d \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy spare tires.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T01:00:03Z","loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":76.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":80.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":82.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":86.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":92.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":96.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":99.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":103.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":106.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":110.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T16:22:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394120,"name":"Wanyina 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe WANYINA 2 est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui sont des amies et qui habitent le m\u00eame quartier.

in the Khoost District of western Ukraine.   He has a son and is divorced.  Andryi rents a warehouse that has been re-equipped as a blacksmith shop where he produces exclusive forged products, namely handrails, gates, furniture, and various pedestals and stands.  Andryi is a talented craftsman.  None of his products are based on patterns, instead he approaches each order individually.  Andryi has no competition. His products enjoy strong demand and he has his own client base.  He has been in this business for 6 years.  His net profit is a little more than 6,000 hryven (UAH) per month.  \r\n\r\nA loan of 10,000 hryven is necessary for Andryi to buy bar stock and additional equipment (a vise) for his blacksmith shop.

He grows early vegetables, radishes, cucumbers, and tomatoes in greenhouses.  Leonid has a large piece of land, three large greenhouses (60 x 9 meters) and two separate greenhouses for seedlings.  He has been farming for eight years.  There are 100,000 hryven (UAH) invested in his farm.  Every year the cost of seed and greenhouse film comes to 36,000 hryven. \r\n\r\nLeonid needs a loan through Kiva of 10,000 hryven to buy 4,000 hryven worth of greenhouse film, 5,000 hryven worth of seed, and 1,000 hryven worth of fertilizer.  The borrowed funds will help Leonid to cover and tighten the film on his greenhouses, while it still isn't very cold, so he can begin to sow seed.  Leonid will invest the profit he earns in improving the living conditions in his home.   Not long ago, they finished a good renovation of their house and were able to install a bath and toilet.  This autumn, Leonid is planning to install good heating in the house which is why he will need to have the additional income.\r\n\r\nNote: story in Russian\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1009591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 4,000 hryven worth of greenhouse film, 5,000 hryven worth of seed, and 1,000 hryven worth of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T17:05:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393575,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen is the mother of seven children with the two youngest still of school age.

is in Brian's genes.  He is a third generation roofing contractor -- his father and grandfather before him were roofing contractors.  Born and raised in New Orleans, Brian has been in the roofing business, as a sole proprietor, for the last 10 years.  He's lived all over New Orleans, but predominantly in the New Orleans East area.\r\n\r\nWhen Hurricane Katrina struck, Brian evacuated to Atlanta to live with relatives. He was only away for one month when a client called him and asked him to return to help rebuild NOLA.  Brian is very enterprising about finding jobs.  He drove by the pictured job site, pulled his truck in and asked the general contractor if he could make a bid on the roof. He won the bid and received six other jobs from the same developer.  Before coming to Kiva, Brian tried to get a loan from a bank, but was turned down.  Brian thanks each of his Kiva lenders for helping him and for helping to rebuild New Orleans.

The family lives in El Porvenir, a rural hamlet whose residents work exclusively in farming and cattle breeding. The hamlet belongs to the district of Olmos, one hour from the city of Chiclayo. It is located in a developing area and electricity is the sole public utility to which it is connected so far.\r\n\r\nJhony's activity consists in transporting passengers between the villages of the area. With the savings from his job as an agricultural laborer he bought a vehicle, which he runs from Monday to Saturday from early morning to late evening. His point of departure is in the district of Olmos, where he covers the route Olmos-Porvenir-\u00d1aupe. He has done this activity for the past four years and could thus support his wife and their two school-aged children.\r\n\r\nJhony is well aware that the roads in his area are badly damaged and have taken their toll on his vehicle.

is Ligaya, sixty-one, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother of four children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLigaya runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Yolanda\u2019s case, she sells used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper than brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, Yolanda is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, also used bags and footwear. If she can roll over the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nLigaya hopes to to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and were she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":166.67,"image":{"id":902300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase additional inventory of clothes and processed meats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T10:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T10:30:18Z","loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ligaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6933,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7136.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275566,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T12:58:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393813,"name":"Saveng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saveng, fifty-three, is married, and resides with her husband and four children in Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia.
