Now he is asking for a 1,000,000 Armenian drams (AMD) loan to buy two more pigs for his farm and also to buy additional fodder for his farm animals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.4,"image":{"id":919731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two more pigs for his farm and to buy fodder for his farm animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ijevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T11:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arshak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":26870},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":26300},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27650},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28510},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27600},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29320},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28910},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29360},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30190},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":29530},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31780},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":31200},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":31360},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":32770},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":32660},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33980},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33680},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34430},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":34270},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35870},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35790},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36170},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":37200},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":37460},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":38030},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38710},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":39050},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":39980},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40500},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":212.4,"local_amount":80913,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":81645.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263696,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-15T13:59:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":358648,"name":"Salma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salma is 49 years old, married and has three sons.

He has dedicated himself to this work for many years, and it is his primary source of income.  He is charged with earning the daily bread for his household, as his mother is now elderly and cannot work to generate income.  For Nelson, his mother is everything, and it is for her that he fights each and every day to provide the food that she would otherwise not have.\r\n\r\nHe has decided to request another loan from INTEGRAL because Christmas is approaching, and he doesn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to make his sales during the holiday season.

He pursues his business for the sake of the bright future of his children. \r\n\r\nThe thought that there are a lot of competitors in the market makes him aggressive and alert to sell. He offers good quality products. This is his advantage and lead against others. Hopefully, he will help his five children finish their education as well as lift his family up from a poor lifestyle.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":218.75,"image":{"id":919789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy pork, car beef and beef as additional goods to sell in his stand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calapangan Norte, Lasam, Cagayan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:01:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3171.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250705265,"comment":null},{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3171.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257108567,"comment":null},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3171.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263495186,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T23:33:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":358709,"name":"Nida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nida is 30 years old, single, and a college graduate, but she has not been fortunate to find better sources of income like a white collar job due to the current employment crisis.

She is married to Lito, a carpenter. She is a mother of eight children, some are married and the remaining ones are still in high school. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide additional income for everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nFilipina buys and sells biscuits and dried fish. What she basically does is buy biscuits in bulk direct from the factory and repackages them in 500 and 1,000 grams. She sells them with a little profit. She sells a variety of biscuits like soda crackers, wafers, and chocolate coated biscuits. The dried fish that she sells comes from Visayas and Mindanao, and most of the dried fish that she sells are Dilis (tiny fish), Danggit (well known dried fish in Cebu) and Salinas. Her regular customers are the office employees of different companies where she regularly delivers her items every payday (15th and 30th of the month). She earns a minimum of 700 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nFilipina is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 28,000 that will help as additional capital. She will use it to buy additional products she needs for her business. Aside from biscuits and dried fish, she plans to add frozen meat products to her goods. It was her customers who have requested that she deliver frozen meats. Her profits allows her family to enjoy some comforts in life and secure their future.\r\n\r\nFilipina dreams of becoming successful in her business and hopes that someday she will be able to purchase a lot as an investment. A harmonious relationship with her husband and a good education and life for their children is her dream for her family.

She earns a minimum of 500 Php in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a loan amounting to 8,000 Php that will serve as additional capital. She will spend it to buy additional car accessories and tires for her business. She believes that different designs of car accessories will definitely help her boost her income.

is 54 and a resident of Quezon City, Philippines. She is separated and a mother of two children. Her children are both married and have families and businesses of their own. She has kept herself busy in her business. She wants to save money for herself and her grandchildren. \r\n\r\nJuanita owns a variety store. She buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, sugar, and primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 650 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 25,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more grocery items, which will enable her to have more stock. She also plans to make her store a little bit bigger. She believes that this will help her to gain income and profit, as it will definitely attract more customers to buy in her store. It will help her to save more money for the expenses of her grandchildren in school. \r\n\r\nJuanita hopes that her business will continue to grow and sustain her daily expenses. She wants to have more profit in order to help her family more. She hopes that all her grandchildren will be able to finish their studies and have good lives once they settle down. She is active in attending the weekly fellowship*, as the sharing inspires her to be full of joy everyday.

She joined a Maya business development training meeting about a year and half ago. After the meeting she asked herself, \"What can I do for myself?\" She spent about 6 months researching and then applied to Maya for individual credit. With the credit she received, she rented a little shop where she sells bulk wholesale and retail cleaning supplies as well as some household brand name supplies, hygienic products and gift items. Most of her clients are housewives. She has been operating her shop for one year. She says the first 6 months were very hard and she didn\u2019t make much money. She was new to the neighborhood and the neighborhood was slow to start doing business with her. They wanted to see what kind of person she is, if her business was solid or would she be gone in 6 months, and what kind of prices she had before they would do business with her. \r\n\r\nT\u00fclay did not ask her husband for support to start her business and, in turn, he wasn\u2019t very supportive. He kept saying and thinking that she wasn\u2019t going to succeed. She wanted to show him she could succeed and after 6 months her business started making money and she paid off her first loan early. T\u00fclay says that to show him she could succeed from her own efforts was very satisfying. She wants to grow her business but did some additional research before taking out her second loan with Maya and her first on Kiva.\r\n\r\nFrom the market research she has done, she will make agreements with two companies in order to buy bulk wholesale cleaning products from them. This is why she needs capital and how she will use her loan. She believes that by working with these two companies she can increase her profits. In the future, she wants to transition her business focus from retail sales to wholesale and expand the types of cleaning products she offers to customers. For example, instead of only selling household cleaning products to housewives, she would like to offer cleaning products for industrial workplaces, such as factories, restaurants, and car dealerships. T\u00fclay is ambitious but plans her business in small steps after careful research.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff\r\n\r\nT\u00fclay 36 ya\u015f\u0131nda evli ve \u00e7ocu\u011fu yok.\r\n\r\nMaya\u2019n\u0131n e\u011fitim toplant\u0131s\u0131na kat\u0131ld\u0131.

She has previously worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer group loans but this is her first experience with an individual loan.  Ingrid lives with her husband and her son who is in elementary school.  Ingrid buys and sells products and this is the tool that she has been using to financially support her household for nearly 10 years.\r\n\r\nIngrid's business is selling underwear and jewelry which she sells through catalogs.  The aim of this loan is to make the most of the large increase in sales which she experiences during the end-of-year season and to acquire a little more merchandise so that she can make more profits.  Ingrid goes out to sell her products and collect payment in the afternoons, once she has finished her household chores.

Los trabajos que inici\u00f3 elaborando eran pocos y sencillos por falta de la maquinaria, pero con transcurso del tiempo Noee ha ido ahorrando y poco a poco a comprado sus herramientas electricas. Su horario de atencion es variado, porque en ocasiones no tiene trabajos y en otras si. Su principal ventaja es que es muy dedicado y cuidadoso en sus trabajos y por eso sus vecinos lo prefieren. Su desventaja es el alto costo de la energia electrica.\n\nEl prestamo que Noee esta solicitando lo necesita para la compra de madera.

He is married and has 3 children. He has been a cabinetmaker for 24 years. His wife takes care of the household chores and his children study. He lives with his family in Silca.\r\n\r\nIn 1987 Noee learned his trade, starting off as an apprendice and assistant at a carpenter's workshop in the city of Tegucigalpa. Later, for personal reasons, he had to move to Silca and it was there that he started to set up his own capenter's workshop and although he didn't have many of the machines he needed, he didn't falter. At the start, the jobs were few and simple for a want of machinery, but with time Noee saved and little by little bought the electrical tools he needs. His work schedule is varied because sometimes there are no jobs and at other times there are. His main advantage is that he is very dedicated and thorough in his work and for this reason his neighbours prefer to use him. His disadvantage is the high cost of electricity.\r\n\r\nNoee needs the loan he is asking for to buy wood. With the support of this loan he can finish a few pieces of furniture pending delivery and also provide an income to cover the upkeep of his family.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a larger and stronger business with several employees. This is his first loan cycle with FAMA and he hopes to makes his repayments on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":137.5,"image":{"id":920284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Silca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T08:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noee Aldrubal ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.37,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":868.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758117,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:44Z","rounded_local_amount":868.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165402,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":868.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263297171,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T09:53:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":359031,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efua is a baker at Dompoase.

She is married and is the mother of 3 children aged 20, 19 and 15, who are students and still depend on her for their education, food and other necessities. She has her own house which she bought with a lot of effort together with her husband and which she shares with children during the day whilst her husband travels to other departments to perform odd jobs. Eva's work consists of cash sales and credit sales of bakery products. She is in charge of placing orders at a wholesale factory that bakes different kinds of products which include sponge cakes, wholemeal bread, cakes. She has a small business in her house where she distributes to her customers. She has been doing this work for 8 years and she does it alone. However, Eva is a woman who is never still as she also raises poultry and also plants regional tomatoes during certain seasons. What she likes about her work is that it allows her to use her time for other activities which gives her a good income and thus she can cover all the scheduled expenses. She would like to undertake a new project which is to set up a restaurant to improve her income. This will be her 17th loan with MFP and as such hopes for your collaboration to pursue her goals. On the other hand, she agrees once again to make her repayments as with the previous loans.

He is a simple but hardworking businessman, 40 years old, a father of a family, and married. He has three children who are 18, 17, and 6 years old. The oldest of his children is taking the first year of an accounting course. His second child is in the third year of high school and his youngest child attends kindergarten. His wife is a housewife but she helps him with his retail clothing business.\r\n\r\nEdgar rents a small place near the town church where he sells clothing for children, juniors, and adults, including pants, blouses, shorts, and men's shirts. Every day he leaves his home carrying all his merchandise to fit it all into his humble carts and begin to sell--to be able to gather his strength and supply for the needs of his family. He tells us that he started this business three years ago with some savings he had, as before that he worked in the city's mayor's office and also worked for different companies. But the scarcity of work became intense and he couldn't get a formal job so he decided to start his own business when he saw very few possibilities of getting work.

For this reason, she decided to start her own business.  However, her work is very exhausting and she is tired at the end of every work day.
