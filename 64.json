Her family currently has 4 members: the parents and 2 children. Her husband, Mr. Pham Van Hung, is a builder. When she did not have children yet, she sold dried food in the market and earned income for her family. This activity is convenient for paying back the money weekly. However, since she had 2 children, she could not work far away from home and as a result, her income decreased.

other income for the family besides income coming from her husband. Their effort is by raising pigs. Widiani bought 4 piggies for Rp. 1 million for fattening. After 4 months her pigs are sold for Rp.800,000,- to Rp. 1,000,000,- each. Net profit for each is Rp.150,000,-. After she cleans the pig pen, Widiani feeds her pigs two times a day, in the morning and afternoon. Profit coming from selling the pigs is used to meet her family daily necessities, for education of her 10th grade child, and for her 4 years-old. Her semi-permanent house was built on her own land. Widiani plans to use loan from Dinari to buy more pigs and the feed.<b><p>Translated by Iman Persada, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHidup di desa membuat Ni Luh Widiani bersama suaminya, Putu Rauh, yang hanya bekerja sebagai tukang, mengharuskannya membuka usaha yang dapat membantu menambah penghasilan lain disamping usaha yang dilakukan oleh suaminya.Usaha itu adalah  memelihara babi. Dengan modal awal Rp.1.000.000,- Widiani membeli 4 ekor  babi dan dipelihara sebagai penggemukan . Setelah dipelihara selama 4 bulan babinya laku terjual dari harga Rp. 800.000 sampai Rp. 1.000.000,- perekor. Keuntungan bersihnya sebesar Rp.150.000.- perekor. Widiani memberi makan babinya sebanyak dua kali sehari pada pagi dan sore hari. Dan Widiani membersihkan kandangnya sebelum babinya diberi makan. Keuntungan yang diperoleh dipakai untuk memenuhi kebutuhannya dan juga untuk pendidikan anaknya yang duduk dikelas I SMA dan yang kedua belum sekolah masih berumur 4 tahun. Rumahnya dibangun ditanah sendiri dengan bangunan yang cukup permanen. Harapannya dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Widiani akan membeli beberapa bibit babi lagi dan sisanya untuk biaya

Jero Tirta started raising pigs with just 1,000,000 given to her by her husband.  She used that money to purchase a sow that she took special care of.  After 6 months of care, the sow gave birth to 7 piglets.  This accomplishment made Jero Tirta even more diligent in her work and more enthusiastic about the potential of her business.  Every day she cleans the pig pen, brings food to them in the form of leaves and a mixture of rice and wheat byproduct from a mill (a common source of animal feed).  After the piglets are one and a half months old, they are sold at the market price of 250,000 Rupiah a piece.  She also has the boars and selected pigs that she will keep and raise for about 5 months until they are fattened.  From selling the boars alone, she believes she can make as much as 1,750,000.  She would use the profits to pay for the further education of her daughter who is in her third year of primary school.  She would also use the profits to fulfill their daily needs.  Jero Tirta hopes to borrow capitol to purchase boars for fattening and the remaining funds for purchasing pig feed.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lender\/courtenaychris\">Courtenay Teska Race<\/a>, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJero Tirta seorang ibu rumah tangga yang ulet bekerja untuk membantu suaminya, Gusti Kade Putrayasa, yang bekerja sebagai petani. Jero Tirta memelihara babi  dengan modal awal Rp. 1.000.000,-  yang diperolehnya dari suaminya, lalu uang itu dibelikan induk babi dan dirawat dengan baik. Hasilnya,  setelah dipelihara selama 6 bulan induk babinya melahirkan anak babi sebanyak 7 ekor  dan ini membuat Jero Tirta semakin rajin dan lebih bersemangat lagi dalam menjalankan usaha ini. Setiap hari kandangnya dibersihkan kemudian diberi makan berupa  dedaunan disamping memberi dedak padi dan dedak gandum. Setelah anak babi berumur satu setengah bulan  anak babi dapat dijual dengan harga pasaran Rp 250.000 per ekor yang masih berupa bibit atau calon babi yang nantinya aka dipelihara lagi sekitar 5 bulan untuk penggemukan.Dari hasil penjualan bibit babi saja dapat diperkirakan Jero Tirta akan mendapatkan pemasukkan sebesar Rp 1.750.000 Keuntungannya dipakai untuk pendidikan anaknya yang masih duduk dikelas 3 SD. Dan juga untuk pemenuhan kebutuhan setiap hari . Harapan Jero Tirta dengan pinjaman dari Dinari Jero Tirta akan membeli bibit babi untuk penggemukan dan sisanya untuk biaya pakan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":115890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

In her store, A. sells items necessary in the day-to-day lives of the people in her area.  These items include small snacks, various types of sweet drinks and other traditional foods.  Starting with only 500,000 Rupiah of her own savings, A. was brave enough to start her own business.  She had the courage to start it because her family did not have a steady flow of work.  Due to her perseverance, her business continues to grow.  Each week she must purchase more goods to replenish her inventory.  Her business currently brings in 20,000 to 30,000 Rupiah per day.

lives with the father of her 4 children. Their ages are 23, 21, 18 and 16. She lives in the village  of Manjacaze, located in the district of the same name. She owns a tailoring business that offers services through special orders. She joined the credit program in 2004 as a group member but that group was dismantled and she decided to stay in the program solely. Her business has shown signs of growth: when she first started, she only had one sewing machine to work with. Now she has added a second machine and she has hired an assistant. With the loan amount, she will purchase a third machine and add a second helper to her staff because demand is expected to rise significantly once the school year starts and parents will be looking to purchase uniforms for their children. All of Irene's children are in secondary school and her dream is to be able to afford a college education for them. To accomplish this dream, which is also the whole family's dream, she will have to double her efforts. Irene's husband does not have a regular job, he makes his living by doing informal work and that is how he helps with the family's expenses. That is why she has to work extra hard so that her family does not lack anything. Irene travels once a month to purchase material in Maputo. She can get them there relatively cheaper than in Manjacaze, where she lives and does her work. She spends 340,00 Mt to travel back and forth from Maputo.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nIrene e mdosta, solteira mas vive com um homem com quem tem 4 filhos de 23, 21, 18 e 16 anos de idade.

He commented, \"The idea is to make the business grow bit by bit.\" <p>\r\n\r\nWith this goal in mind, he is asking for a loan of $650. He is ready to repay this loan over a period of 5 months. With the money, he will be able to buy more merchandise so that he can have something new to offer his customers. With your help Juan will be able to succeed and thus give his daughters a better future.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from the Spanish by Susanna Heinz, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJuan Gabriel, trabaja como repartidor en una empresa de venta de refrescos, sin embargo, con lo que gana no le alcanza para pagar los gastos de sus 2 hijas, a quienes tiene estudiando para que \u00e9stas puedan tener un mejor futuro.

Since she wanted to make sure that her children could study, she started this business to cover those costs. <p>\r\n\r\nRosa wants to further grow her business; this is why she is asking for a loan of $800, which she will be able to repay within 6 months.

Z. is 27 years old, has a college education and is an economist by training.  He is married and has 2 children.  Ahliddin owns a car which he uses to offer taxi services to residents of Qurgan-Tube.  Ahliddin will use his loan to purchase equipment that will allow him to use gas instead of gasoline in his car.  This will allow him to control his costs and to not raise his fares.  Local residents will be able to take advantage of Ahliddin\u2019s lower priced fares, as many cannot afford the fare increases resulting from increasing gasoline prices.

This capital will allow us to buy raw materials in necessary quantity which we will dye and put up for sale in reception centers in our Department and other villages in Senegal. The most positive part is that the interest these young girls are taking in this aspect of production, which until now was done abroad, will make our work sustainable. To all the benefits, training will be added, and all thanks to Kiva.

Gilas M. lives in the suburb of the town of Saatli, Azerbaijan located in the South Caucasus. Gilas is 44. She shares a small village house with her parents providing for them in their old age. Gilas small income comes from sale of milk of the two cows that she purchased two years ago. The daily 8 liters of milk from the two cows sell for about $1.50. Obviously, this is not enough to sustain Ms. M.\u2019s family. She plans to use this loan to purchase another milk cow. Gilas hopes that in 8 months she will be able to increase her income from milk sales by 100%.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\u0413-\u0436\u0430

H. is 50 years old, has a high school education, is married and has 10 children.

Ashur will use a portion of his harvest for personal uses \u2013 making flour and baking bread.  He will sell the rest of his harvest to local residents as many cannot afford to purchase flour and instead purchase wheat for further processing as it is much cheaper.

Karahodjaev is 60 years old, married and has 6 children. He has a High school education. Gulboy owns several hectares of land that were given to him from the presidential fund. The sowing season is approaching, but Gulboy does not have enough funds to purchase seeds. He plans to use the obtained loan to purchase mineral fertilizer, wheat seeds, fuel and machine oil. A portion of the obtained crops will be used for personal needs while the other portion will be sold to the locals at a relatively low price. Most people living in the area use wheat to make flower and bake bread for personal consumption. \r\nGulboy is planing to repay the loan over a period of 11 months. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (the altituD. ranges from 6,000 to 17,000 feet above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR Virgen D. las Mercedes has its base in the capital of  the province of Churcampa, which is located at over 10,000 feet above sea level. Currently the bank has completed 2 loan cycles in just one year of existence with 17 female borrowers. Some of the group members live in small communities outsiD. the city of Churcampa, in places like El Carmen and Chupas, more than an hour of walking distance away.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the bank, during their one year in FINCA Peru, besides having learned to be responsible and punctual, are learning more and more about savings and how to invest their loans. The group was able to save over 5,500 soles (about $1,800) in the first 2 loan cycles and will continue to save in the future.  For all members, the main use of the savings is for the education of their children: buying school uniforms, supplies, books and even to pay for entering primary or secondary school.  Another dream they have for the use of their savings is to be able to make renovations to their houses, like constructing another floor or changing the roof to a more sustainable one.\r\n<p>\r\nAll members have different enterprises, ranging from raising guinea pigs, having a kiosk with sweets and juices close to the primary school, selling food and ice creams, buying and selling small animals, selling potatoes, selling chicken or having grocery stores.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery member has a different testimony, as is the case of 36-year-old Mary O. C., who has a small grocery store in the central square of Churcampa, where she also sells homemaD. sweets. As with many women, she has more than one occupation: she also buys and sells chicken. The chicken she buys in a major city that is more than 8 hours away by public transport. Her dream is to grow her business and keep on saving to be able to pay for the education of her 3 children. Her new loan she will use for buying more groceries for her store.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother story is the one of Edith A. G., who has a grocery store and buys and sells small animals like sheep and lamb. Those are the businesses she runs during the whole year, but living in a rural area, she also has fields of corn and is waiting for the harvest in May to be able to sell her corn.

Tagoeb is 25 years old, married and has 3 children. She also has a High school education. She has a small grocery store in the Tutak village, Javansk region. Initzor plans to use the money from the loan to increase the selection of goods she has for sale. Her primary customers are the people of the village. The loan will therefore allow the locals to purchase produce in their own village as opposed to having to travel to the central market of the region located several kilometers away from where they live.
