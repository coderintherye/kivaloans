has been working patiently to provide the needs of her children. She is engaged in a retail business but she still does not have her own stall where she can display her products.  She admits that her daily profits are not sufficient to meet their daily needs. For this reason, she is also working as a stay-out housemaid and accepts laundry in their village to earn additional income. With the business she is engaged in, she is accumulating an income which is sufficient for her family and sometimes providing for other needs of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nAs a businesswoman, Martina would like to expand her retailing business to be more profitable and somehow develop her own retail stall where she could display her products.  She hopes to borrow a loan of PHP 4,000 from the Kiva lenders.  She will use the loan to purchase more stock for her store that will result in an income increase.

She and her husband join hands to provide the needs of their children.\r\n\r\nCorazon has a small pigpen at the back of their house and she started raising hogs early this year. This business is quite good because she considers it as an investment that she can use in times of emergency and to support the needs of their children.  She is requesting the amount of PHP4,000 to maintain her hog-raising business and somehow improve it. To generate income everyday, she also offers manicure and pedicure services to everyone in the village who is interested in paying her service fee of PHP40\/person only.

Absel, the youngest, is also in college. Sending them to college is very costly. Celia hopes that her children will finish their studies with her financial support. \r\n\r\nTo help her husband in providing for the growing needs of their children, Celia began selling beauty soaps. She gets orders from people in her community and then purchases her products in Tumauini, Isabela. She also maintains a hog-raising business in their home. To further grow both of her businesses, Celia is requesting a loan for PHP9,000 from Kiva lenders. She hopes to obtain a loan from lenders to have her business raise more capital. She plans to purchase stocks of beauty soaps and feed supply for her hogs to help them grow bigger. She hopes that her loan will be approved so that her businesses will remain stable.

Since Philippines is an agricultural country, most of the folks are engaged in farming and rice is the staple food for every Filipino. But to farm, one also needs capital. A farmer will invest her money for almost three months from planting until the rice harvest. Farming brings her enough income and generates food. However, she needs money to sustain her farm needs.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with hopes of having access to capital. Her previous loans, over the past five years, were spent on farm supplies. Now on her 8th loan, she proposes a loan of 12,000 pesos to use as additional capital for her farming business. Specifically, the loan will be used to rent a hand tractor, and to pay for pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and labor.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of ASHI and trust of KIVA, she can improve her farm, buy some farm equipment, and also to send her children to school until they finish college and find

Wilson is doing her best to provide the needs of his family and one of his goals is to send their children to school.  \n\nWilson has been managing a store and a bakeshop in their village. He has been in this kind of business for already two years and he always wanted to further grow his business, however, availability of sufficient capital hinders him. He hopes to avail a loan amounting to PHP7, 000 to be used as his additional working capital for his retail business. The loan will be of big help for the progress of his business so he prays that lenders will give him the opportunity of improving his general store and

To make a living, Shirley owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Shirley is just starting this business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Shirley joined HSPFI. Her goal was to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Shirley is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, an amount that will be used to purchase new items in order to expand the store's product offerings. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Shirley from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is hoping to acquire additional revolving capital for the growth of her vending business. She could buy more vegetables with more capital thus will increase her income. If given the chance to avail a loan, she will also use it in purchasing vegetable seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for her vegetable garden. Yolanda therefore is asking for financial amount of PHP4, 000 for further development of her vending business.

is a responsible mother to her four children. She is married to Santiago, a farmer. Their eldest son, Florentino, is 22 years old. He graduated from college and is now working as a dental technician in Manila. Their second child, Harold, age 19, is currently studying to be a dental technician in Manila. Next is Myrna, age 16 and Epifanio, age 12, both of whom are studying in high school. Lina hopes that all her children finish their studies because she believes that their achievements in life are also achievements for their parents who supported them all the way.  \r\n\r\nLina is requesting a loan of PHP 4,000 from Kiva. She will use the loan to improve her rice business. She sells rice and vegetables three times a week in the market. When not in the market, she tries to sell her vegetables in their village through house-to-house vending. She hopes that, with patience, she can send all her children to college and attain their dream, which is to finish their studies and look for jobs. She is glad that her husband also works hard as a farmer. They strive to give their children a bright future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":393635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits

V. is a 34 year-old married woman with 3 young children. Her youngest child is only 5 months old and the oldest is just 9. She is married to John V. and the family lives in the village of Purok Paraiso, Brgy. Abuanan, Bago City, Negros Occidental. Renea aspires to help her husband increase their family income enough to sustain the needs of her children and provide for their future security.\r\n\r\nRenea is always looking for opportunities to provide her family with an additional source of income. First, she started a business selling a variety of native delicacies at the local school. As her small business prospered, she needed more capital to meet her customer's demands. This made her decide to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, which provided access to more capital for her business expansion. By her 3rd loan cycle, she already had some savings and was able to open a general store where she sells ready-to-wear clothes. \r\n\r\nThe new ventures were quite successful from the start and her husband encouraged her to put her skills into other possibilities. He suggested that they buy a sow so that they could start raising pigs in their backyard. This turned out to be a wise decision.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed PHP 15,000 to invest in her various business ventures, including hog-raising. She was able to repay her loan on time without any delays in the weekly installments. Now that she is borrowing her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she intends to borrow PHP 16,000 so that she can buy another sow and expand her general store,  which is adjacent to her house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":393450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Only Mila, her youngest daughter who has special needs, lives at home. Remedios lives in the village of Serena, Brgy. Enclaro, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. The death of her husband left her bereft, especially as she has to take care of her youngest, who has disabilities. Her business activities actually help her to slowly forget her grief and move on. Having a child who totally depends on her gives her a reason and motivates her to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nRemedios has a general store which she sustains through her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon. This has been her source of income for the past 15 years and it provides her with a net profit of 8,000 Philippine pesos a month, enough to cover her small household's expenses and allow her to save enough to buy appliances, renovate her house and also invest in a frozen-foods business. She is very thankful for the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon because her five children were able to finish their academic education and because it continues to help her be independent and support her special child.\r\n\r\nShe just paid off her 13th loan cycle of Php 19,500 without any delays in the weekly installment. For her 14th cycle, she is borrowing Php 19,500 to continue the sustainability of her general store. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 42; is married; and is the mother of 5 children, whose ages range from 16- to 30-years-old.  All of them are in school except for the two oldest.  Celeste studied through 5th grade and had to stop because of the financial situation of her parents during the Portuguese colonial rule.  She grew up in the company of her two parents in the district of Namaacha in the Mafuiane region.  She only left there after she got married and went to live in the district of Boane with her husband.  He is in the military.  She lives in her own home with her three youngest children, and she doesn't have any additional family members to support.  She has her small business in the same area as her home.  She learned to do this activity with her friends in the year 2000.  She sells various products such as sugar, popcorn, cookies, beauty products, hygiene products, etc.  She has a monthly income of 6,000 meticais, which she puts towards supporting her family.  She also saves some money through a traditional savings group, which is known as xitque.  This is Celeste's second loan, and it is for 20,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy and sell basic products (popcorn, soap, cookies, beauty products, etc.).  She believes that by raising the volume of her business, she will be able to earn more money and increase the satisfaction of her customers.  Her first loan was for 15,000 meticais, which she used for the same purpose.  She received information about Hluvuku-Adsema through neighbors and other clients of the institution.

She lives off the rent she earns from a building that was left to her by her grandfather in the city of Maputo, which she rents out, earning 12.000,00MT monthly.  She is using the money to build a brick home in phases, and to cover family expenses.   \r\n\r\nShe learned to run a business (selling a variety of products) in the city of Maputo, before moving to Boane where she has lived for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nThis is Aurea's first loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 12.000,00MT.

She is 53 years old, and is married with 7 children between ages 7 and 22.  Her children attend public schools in Boane.  She also supports one of her nephews who lives with her.  She attended school until the third grade during the colonial era, but stopped when she became pregnant.  Later she enlisted in the armed forces of the national liberation, for independence from the colonial yoke.\r\n\r\nShe lives in her own home with her family (husband, children, and nephew).  She also cares for her mother in her home.\r\n\r\nShe left Tete in 1981 for Boane, alone, to meet up with her husband who was in the military.  Mariana was also in the military, and fought for independence along with her husband. Both she and her husband receive a pension from the Ministry of National Defense.  They met in the military before the end of the war.  Each of them receives 5.740.00MT monthly, totaling 11.480.00MT, which they use to support their family and for construction of a cement block home.\r\n\r\nMariana had loans with other similar institutions and said that she heard about Hluvuku-Adsema through two neighbors who were clients of Hluvuku-Adsema and found the payment method to be democratic (the client defines the monthly payment in accordance with his\/her ability to pay and can pay off the loan early without any penalties).\r\n\r\nThis will be Mariana's second loan, in the amount of 12.000,00MT for the purchase of construction materials (cement, sand, etc.).  Her first loan was for 10.000,00MT for the same purposes. \r\n\r\nShe plans to pay back the loan without any problems in order to have access to additional loans to finish her home and strengthen her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":393741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of construction materials (cement, sand, etc.) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-27T20:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariana Califonha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":545.03},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":567.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":590.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":615.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":640.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":694.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":722.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":752.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":783.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":815.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":848.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":883.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":920.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":957.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":997.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.15,"local_amount":1950.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1984.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056888,"comment":null},{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":1545.72,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971848,"comment":null},{"amount":60.15,"local_amount":1603.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1631.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708969,"comment":null},{"amount":258.74,"local_amount":6899.66,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7018.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938019,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-27T22:03:27Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":139360,"name":"Hilaha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hilaha J. is currently in the business of selling charcoal and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of charcoal to sell.

C. is 31 years old, and comes from the central part of the City of Masaya.  This area specializes in the production of handicrafts, such as leather work, pottery, plastic, and others.  Francisco is the head of a young family which includes his daughter of 6 years, to whom he dedicates his life and work, and his wife, who has supported him in all of his projects and dreams.  He owns a handicraft workshop, where he works making footwear, such as slippers and shoes for schoolchildren.  He learned the trade because he worked as an employee in a workshop in the occupation that they call \"alistadores\" (this term refers to those who make the sole of the shoe, and later give it to those who finish it.)  His aunt distributes shoes in different areas of the country; this motivated him to have his own workshop, since she offered to sell the shoes that he would produce.  Francisco has passed through some difficult situations, as when he suffered appendicitis, and was just recovering when his mother died.  This loss was very hard for his family, but most of all for him.  In spite of this, with the help of his wife and the encouragement and love of his daughter, he decided to exert himself much more and, with the loans that he secured, establish a mini grocery store.  The current loan will be invested in the growth of the mini grocery and in raw materials for his workshop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She started earning a living by putting up a small <i>carinderia<\/i>, or luncheonette, adjacent to her house to serve meals to the locals. It became so popular that she was inspired to expand her services and began to offer coffee and snacks between meal times. In 2002, she became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could have access to additional capital to expand her business because, as she explains, \"If you have a bigger investment [and] if you manage your business well, you will surely get a bigger return also.\"  Over time, Emilia has saved up and bought properties as an investment to secure her future.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from her luncheonette and cafeteria, Emilia earns additional income from two houses that she rents out. The smaller house is being rented by two students, while her bigger house is rented by a religious group. Emilia has been operating her carinderia and cafeteria for 32 years and she has been a landlord for only two. Her business nets her a profit of 4,000 pesos per month, which is enough for her living expenses, and she's been able to keep a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon for the seven years that she's been a member. Her previous loan of 19,500 pesos for her 11th loan was fully repaid on time without any delays in any of her weekly installments. \r\n<p>\r\nNow for her 12th loan cycle, Emilia is again borrowing 19,500 pesos to add to her working capital to ensure the sustainability of her business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":393673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Additonal capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"La Castellana, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-09-29T03:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102,"local_amount":4680,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4847.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004142,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3231.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848914,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3231.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739582,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4039.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129010,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3231.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965806,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":1560,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1615.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997721,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-01T01:28:08Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":139422,"name":"Amarilis Del Establo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"OLGA LIDIA V.

C., 44, is married to Robert C., a 59-year-old laborer on a sugarcane plantation. They have three children: the oldest, 25, already has his own family and is a graduate of an Automotive course; their second child, 22, is currently studying Computer Technology, and the youngest, 18, is a second-year student of a computer programming course. The family lives in the village of Brgy. La Granja, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental.<p> \r\n\r\nBecause of the very small and seasonal income that the family earns, Nilda has tried hard to earn her own income to provide additional support. Using her savings, she opened a general store in their community, but with very limited capital, she had a small stock inventory and the returns and turnover of her goods for sale remained low, but the business still helped with their household expenses. In 1999, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have access to additional capital for her business and has since poured all of her loans into the general store, with resulting increases in income. <p>\r\n\r\nAs her business improved, she decided to invest in a motorcycle for her oldest son so that he could also earn extra income. Later she also started to raise pigs in their backyard and became an Avon beauty products dealer. She used the income from her business to invest in new ventures as well as provide for the education of her children. <p> \r\n\r\nNilda's previous loan, her 14th from NWTF-Project Dungganon, amounted to PHP 9,500 and was used as additional capital for her business. She repaid that loan within the term and was never late in meeting her weekly installments. Now on her 15th loan cycle, she intends to continue maintaining her good credit standing by diligently paying the weekly installments required to retire the loan of PHP 12,000 that she is requesting, money that will be added to the working capital of her general store. She also plans to invest in another motorcycle to increase the income potential of her family so that she can continue to afford the tuition fees of her two college students who are attending university in Bacolod City. She is very thankful to NWTF-Project Dungganon for helping her move closer to the attainment of her aspirations and dreams for her family.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but of thousands of women.

Mildred, 43, is married to Edgardo and they have six children. Their oldest son has already graduated from high school. Four of her children are still attending school and the youngest, who is just 5, is a preschooler. \r\n\r\nWhen Mildred realized that it was impossible for them to make ends meet with just her husband's salary, she racked her brain for ideas on what business ventures to go into.  She went into many business ventures like selling \"Ginamos\" or shrimp paste, opening a general store in their neighborhood and, when she was earning enough, she rented land which she turned into a vegetable farm. \r\n\r\nShe sold her vegetable harvest in the local market and in the neighboring towns and soon vegetable buyers started going to her offering to buy her produce in bulk volumes. Her vegetable farm earns an average monthly income of 5,000 Philippine pesos, which she reinvests in the business, uses to pay for their household expenses and sets aside some savings for the education of her children. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 was paid back in full without any delays or delinquencies. She plans to use her 13th loan of PHP 19,500 as additional working capital for her vegetable farm so that she could pay the landowner the rental fee for the land and for the education and security of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women.

is Jocelyn T., 39 years old, who lives in Silang, Cavite. Her husband works as a driver. Both their two children are in grade school.\r\n\r\nJocelyn manages her own general store. She opened it only last year but it has already grown rapidly. She also sells pre-paid electronic load credits for mobile phones because almost all her neighbors are now using mobile phones. Her store is located along a busy street so business is brisk and she makes close to P15,000 a month. She has saved much of her profits and recently was able to buy a brand-new motorized tricycle.\r\n\r\nJocelyn became a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2007 and is now on her 6th loan. She applied for a new loan of P11,000 from the cooperative which she will use to open another store. It has been her dream to acquire a property in Tagaytay City, a tourist spot next to her town. Should her dream come true, sooner or later, she said she would also put a grocery store on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents

N. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga del sur. She is 45 years old and married with one school-aged child. To make a living, Flordelita owns and operates a retail \"sari-sari\" (variety) store. She sells food, candies and eggs in the local community. Flordelita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $75 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Flordelita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flordelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
