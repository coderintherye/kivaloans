is 23 years old, married, has one child and lives in Al Aqaba, Jordan. She is the oldest daughter in a family with five children. When she was growing up, her mother did not work outside of their home, but had a reputation in her community as an excellent cook. Diala remembers waking up early in the morning before school and bathing and grooming her younger sisters, all the while being drawn to the kitchen by the smell of the fresh falafel, beans and warm bread with hot tea that her mother would prepare for breakfast. Though her family survived on the small income that her father made as a spice peddler, Diala remembers how her mother kept their door open to her neighbors and friends, who knew they could always stop by for a warm welcome and a hot meal.\r\n\r\nDiala learned the art of food preparation from her mother, along with her commitment to share their food and homes with people in their community.

Two years ago her daughter-in-law died. Since then she has been helping her oldest son take care of 3-year old Yeraldine.

In the last few months she has obtained a small stall where she sells the delicious food that she has cooked, and that is proving a profitable enterprise. The local people know that she is a good cook as she used to sell food in a corner of the main square, not a very comfortable place for her customers. Teodesia also grows various local fruits in a garden at her house. This produce is mostly eaten by the family but occasionally she has enough to sell. \r\n\r\nA short time ago she suffered another attack of kidney stones, but even that didn\u2019t discourage her. \r\n\r\nNow, with help from her community bank, she wants to buy materials for a new restaurant. She wishes to make a name for herself in the work she most enjoys: cooking. Teodesia belongs to La Palmeras Community Bank. This is her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she hopes that with their assistance she will be able to achieve her goals. She promises to pay back the loan on schedule as she did with previous loans.\r\n\r\nTeodesia is grateful to be part of a community bank as all the members are responsible, committed people. Once she has received the loan, she plans to buy bags of rice and sugar to use in the wonderful local dishes that she cooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":802117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy bags of rice and sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-29T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodosia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T12:59:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312199,"name":"Marcelino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Marcelino se dedica  a la elaboraci\u00f3n de zapatos de cholita (se llama cholita a la campesina de pollera) y tambi\u00e9n trabaja como chofer.

Now they are flowering and he hopes to obtain good results at harvest, and due to his experience, buyers are visiting his farm to buy his production.\r\n\r\nLike a good family man, responsible and with aspirations for his children, he recently rented a house in the city of Huancayo, where his children are studying at a recognized state university. His wife has moved there to care for them. This new era has motivated him to work as a brick layer in his free time, since he earns more in this work -- as much as 3,000 or 4,000 new sols per month -- with which he hopes to realize his objective of advancing his children.\r\n\r\nJuan belongs to \u201cEl Palomar al Exito\u201d (The Dovecote for Success) Communal Bank and this is his 1st loan with MFP, where he hopes for your collaboration to achieve his objectives. He, in turn, promises to comply with his schedule of payments, as with his previous loans. Moreover, he is pleased to be part of his communal bank because all the members are responsible people with much solidarity.\r\n\r\nUpon obtaining his loan, Juan will invest in various sacks of organic manure to spread on the plantain crops he planted some 2 months ago and that have to be fertilized constantly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":802125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy sacks of organic manure for his plantain crop.

It was there that she formed her family together with Elmer, her husband of 14 years.  The couple have five dependent children who they care for with a lot of love.  They live in their own home.\r\n\r\nCesarina started her family when she was very young and this gave her the incentive to get ahead in life together with her husband, who now occupies a political post in one of the area's towns.  Thanks to farming (which is her main financial support), Cesarina was able to buy her own farm land where she now grows coffee, cassava and bananas.  She managed all this with just five years experience.  She sells her harvests in the town of Pichanaki, where she makes good profits.\r\n\r\nWhat Cesarina most enjoys about her work is being able to harvest the fruit from her crops: \"It is very rewarding after so much effort\" she says.  Cesarina would like to continue buying more plots of land to farm so that she can grow a larger quantity of coffee as she predicts a rise in the market over the next few years and she would like to make the most of this.  This will enable her to provide her children with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nCesarina belongs to the 'Los Clavelitos de Shankivironi' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges once again to make her loan repayments on time as she has done with her previous loans.  Cesarina enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.  With your support, Cesarina will invest the money she has requested in paying the workers who are helping her with her coffee harvest.  She will also use some of the money to buy a new plot of farm land."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":802133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers to help her with her coffee harvest.

They live in their own home.\r\n\r\nElvis' reason for striving to make progress and be successful is his 17 year-old son Airton.  In spite of the fact that he does not live with him, he loves him and provides him with a good quality of life.  For this reason, more than 15 years ago, he bought ten hectares of farm land where he grows coffee and bananas in large quantities.  What he most enjoys about farming is being in the fields, growing and caring for his crops which will soon bear fruit.  He tells us that during harvest time he buys and sells coffee as a middleman for a production company.  This makes him some extra money which he adds to the money that he makes for selling his own products.  However, the business activity which Elvis spends most of his time on is his business offering Internet services, a public telephone service (where people make telephone calls) and booths where people can watch movies.  This business is doing very well since there are no other businesses like it in his area.  He is the only one who works in this field.  For this reason, he is always planning on improving his customer service and the services he provides.\r\n\r\nElvis belongs to the \"El Palomar al \u00c9xito\" community bank and this is his fourth loan from MFP.  He hopes to receive your cooperation in helping him to carry out his plans.  For his part, he pledges to make his repayments on time as he did with his previous loans.

She thanks you for your support. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":283.33,"image":{"id":802183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743309,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-26T08:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594770,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5107.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691510,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647875,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-28T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865008,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257274992,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416458,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T04:57:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312232,"name":"Ana Delfina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Delfina: de 20 a\u00f1os y se dedica a la venta de artesanias como comfeccion de guipiles y elavoracion de delantales, actividad que lleva a\u00f1os de realizarlo y nos cuenta que esta muy agradecida con Dios ya que pues sU. ventas han prosperado y el encargo de sU. clientes han aumentado porque confecciona muy bonito y ya es reconocida por las prendas que confecciona ella nos cuenta que nececita el credito para la compra de materia prima para la confeccion de tejidos y asi seguir con su negocio, el sue\u00f1o de ella es prosperar y tener un mejor futuro mas adelante.","en":"20-year old Ana Delfina earns her living making and selling items such as traditional blouses and aprons.

In the future, Sanu plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.

She works in the family hardware business that her parents started more than twenty years ago. She learned all about the business as she grew up.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago she decided to become self-sufficient and sell hardware at the same stall as her parents. This allowed her to pay for her studies. But she also has plans to expand and have her own stall.\r\n\r\nCurrently Susan\u2019s goal is to obtain different types of hardware using her own money such as plaster, bolts, and pipe connectors. She believes that the loans she obtains from Kiva partner MFP are very important for her business as they allow her to gradually increase her working capital.

She developed this passion from garage sale \u201ctreasure hunting\u201d excursions taken with her mother as a child. As she got older, Dalia realized that she also had a natural talent for decorating and design. With this combination of talent and passion as her guide, she started her own antique, clothing and women\u2019s services store in Abilene, Texas.\r\n\r\nDalia attributes the quick rise and success of her business to her relentless hard work along with the efforts of her husband and two children. When she first started Stokes and Company 5 years ago, it was a small booth inside of an antiques mall. \u201cMy husband persuaded me to follow my dreams, so I opened the booth. Within 6 months, it tripled in size; 6 months after that, we expanded to our own location. After 5 years, we moved from a 1200-square-foot store to our current location, nearly three times that size,\u201d she says. Without the persistent dedication of her family, who have done everything from manage the business to repairing its buildings, Dalia believes this success would never have been possible.\r\n\r\nStokes and Company offers its customers used and reupholstered furniture, antiques, home d\u00e9cor items, and clothing for women. She says that her business takes old furniture and, using her natural eye for design, repairs it to give it a \u201cnew life.\u201d In her own words, \u201cI feel like my business is like a jewelry box: you\u2019ll never know what you can find when you go in there. That\u2019s what sets me apart from others.\u201d She believes that the unique service she provides and her store\u2019s constantly changing inventory compel her clients to return to Stokes and Company.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Dalia hopes to continue offering her customers one-of-a-kind service while expanding her business to cater to the everyday needs of women. In its new location, Dalia has split the store into two parts: one for the antiques and furniture shop and the other to serve as a studio to create custom pieces for customers. She also added a waxing salon to bring her business closer to the goal of catering to the diverse needs of her women customers.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Dalia will expand her inventory to fit the needs of her business\u2019 new space. While the move to a 3500-square-foot location is necessary, this means that her current inventory covers only about 1\/3rd of that space. After realizing that a commercial bank would not fit her business needs, Dalia reached out to Kiva's partner ACCION Texas-Louisiana. With this loan, Dalia will not only continue to serve her loyal clients, but she will expand her services to meet the needs of an even more diverse part of her community.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1593.12,"image":{"id":798452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

started his St. Rose, Louisiana-based staffing business, \"My TBS, LLC\", because he has always liked being independent. He also gets great enjoyment from watching business ideas mature and develop. Balancing his business, marriage, and four children along with a full-time career spanning 18 years, Ricardo also enjoys being busy. He describes himself as a stereotypical entrepreneur: \u201cI\u2019m goal and big-picture oriented. I\u2019m very good at aligning myself to my goals and driving to success.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo\u2019s business connects qualified blue and white collar workers to businesses that need their services. He says, \u201cWe contract employees in fields from IT and computer technology to grass mowing and labor.\u201d Currently, Ricardo runs his business \u201clean and mean,\u201d with himself as the only full-time employee. All of his other employees are the contract workers that he has connected to his business clients, of which there are about ten currently.\r\n\r\nRicardo believes that his business\u2019 biggest success is its ability to connect talented individuals with businesses that need them. \u201cSuccess is when you are able to provide employment for qualified people. Even as a contract worker, you are on contract for two years or better; that\u2019s gainful employment. That is success.\u201d \r\n\r\nWorking in the staffing business is a constant challenge, Ricardo states. The ongoing obstacles presented by an ever-changing job market require him to regularly retool, redirect and redevelop his business and its practices. He also says that, because opportunities open and close so quickly in his business, the need to prioritize and manage resources properly is an ever-present challenge. The way he has been able to overcome these challenges is, as he says, by \u201cknowing the business. The more you know, the better equipped you are to handle the demands of the job.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ricardo hopes to see his business become 100% self-sufficient. Currently, he continues his full-time work in his professional career while managing My TBS on the side. While he likes the financial security this provides him and his family, he would one day like to be able to rely totally on his business.\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Ricardo to meet the demands of several quick turn-over projects in his business\u2019 future. \u201cIn this business, you have to be ready to move on opportunities quickly. You can\u2019t afford to be slow while pursuing opportunities that open up.\u201d The cash he will get from this loan will allow Ricardo to jump on upcoming opportunities at a competitive speed. It will allow him to continue to serve his business clients, his workers and his community by providing gainful employment to those who need it.\r\n\r\nWith his 18 years of experience in mind, Ricardo has this to say to aspiring business owners: \u201cOnly when you\u2019ve had a lot of knock downs and bruises are you poised to experience success. Stay with it, get the training you need, and learn your business. If you don\u2019t see success the first time, drop back and go at it again. Learn from your mistakes.\u201d This wisdom has carried Ricardo to success, and this loan will help him continue to build on what he\u2019s learned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1608.53,"image":{"id":799388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

Collision and Auto Repair\", as a family affair. The staff is comprised of Israel, his father and his brother. With a true entrepreneurial spirit, he states that the reason for starting his business was, simply, that \u201cnobody was hiring.\u201d With combined 40 years of experience, Israel and his family were able to take the grim reality of the economic downturn and turn it into a business opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe road to a successful business, Israel says, hasn\u2019t been an easy one. When he opened his business, which offers a wide range of automobile services from mechanical repairs to body work, it was located in a small shop in a residential neighborhood that wasn\u2019t a prime location for a body shop. The most successful business choice C. Auto Repair has made since it opened was moving from its original shop in Rueda, Texas, to a larger shop in Dallas. Of this choice, Israel says, \u201cWe took a leap of faith and moved to Dallas, and we just started growing based on referrals alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile he is happy about the business\u2019 success in its new location, Israel is constantly driving to grow and expand the services he offers. \u201cIn the future, I would really like to offer full-service everything \u2013 state inspections and alignments in a year or two, and, eventually, one or two other locations,\u201d he says. Getting to this future goal involves tireless work from Israel and his family \u2013 the shop is open for business 7 days a week, and Israel is typically there from open to close.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, C. Auto Repair was able to attain the operating capital needed to begin working in its new location. A large portion of the loan was used to install the plumbing systems necessary to get certified by the state. The remainder allowed Israel to buy an inspection machine, which will be used to further him toward his goal of turning C. Auto into a full-service shop.\r\n\r\nIsrael\u2019s business ethic is rooted in a dedication to good customer service. The advice that he gives to aspiring business owners is that \u201cthe biggest thing is return customers; always take care of your customers, and in return they will take care of you.\u201d This loan has allowed Israel to continue doing work he loves, expand his family business and continue to reliably serve the automobile needs of his Dallas community.

She tells us that from a very young age, her father taught her to make the sweets typical of the region; cocadas (coconut sweets), dulce de leche (caramels), dulce de ajongoli (sesame seed sweets), jamoncillo (fudge), and alfafores (cookies filled with dulce de leche).  Since that time, she began making the sweets and going out to sell them to nearby communities such as Vicente and Tetela.  She sells the sweets door to door, and she wants to earn a little extra money to help her husband with household expenses and the education of their children.\r\n\r\nShe talks a little about the preparation of some of the sweets; she makes the cocadas with ground coconut, the dulce de leche caramels are made with milk and sugar, the dulces de ajongoli with sesame seeds, the jamoncillo fudge with pipian seeds (a type of squash) and the alfafores cookies with corn.   She tells us that the preparation of the sweets is not very easy, because it requires a lot of dedication and knowing the time needed to prepare each kind of sweet.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to invest in purchasing corn, pipian seeds, sesame seeds, milk, sugar, coconut, pineapple, to subsequently make her delicious sweets and go out to sell them.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Elvira hopes to grow her business because she wants her business to flourish and to be able to invest a little in the sale of perfumes which she plans to sell to her friends and neighbors in the community.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nClaudia - sells clothing via catalog\r\nSandra - sells fabric shoes\r\nAmalia - sells Mexican corn-based foods\r\nBernardino - sells chickens\r\nArcadia - sells sweets\r\nGuadalupe - provides milling services\r\nIrma - sells clothing\r\nOfelia - sells ceramic\r\nGeronimo - sells sweets\r\n\r\n\r\nEn el estado de Oaxaca existe una comunidad llamada la Palma la cual se caracteriza por estar ubicada en una zona ca\u00f1era y tener unos de los rios mas bonitos y mas visitados de toda la region.

By selling these products, she earns a little extra money which she uses to help her husband with their household expenses and to cover their children's education expenses.  She tells us that she placed a small table in the front of her home and this is where she sells her sweet treats.  She tells us that her sales are good because the local children always fancy a sweet treat and many of the families in the community have a soft drink while they eat.\r\n\r\nIsmaela needs this loan to invest in buying soft drinks and sweet treats to re-stock her business.  She tells us that sometimes lifts her table and her sweet treats up onto her small cart and takes them to sell at the sports field on days when there are soccer matches.  She would like her business to prosper and would like to invest her profits in buying some groceries so that she can grow her business.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nVictoria - who sells Mexican snacks\r\nRufina - who sells groceries\r\nVenancia - who sells fish\r\nMar\u00eda - who raises livestock\r\nJulia - who sells fish\r\nMar\u00eda S. - who sells groceries\r\nCarmela - who sells tacos\r\nMar\u00eda del Carment - who sells snacks\r\nInerva - who sells chicken\r\nHilda - who sells soft drinks\r\nElizabeth - who sells soft drinks"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":802239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to sell sweet treats, snacks, groceries and soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Arroyo Chicali, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Venancia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mineva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":37000,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1562.5,"local_amount":18500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":18646.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223458,"comment":null},{"amount":390.63,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4661.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201735,"comment":null},{"amount":1171.87,"local_amount":13875,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":13984.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807325,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-06T05:39:52Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312330,"name":"Alejandra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandra de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, casado con Teofilo de 45 a\u00f1os, que fruto de esta relaci\u00f3n tiene 2 hijos, Elba de 8 a\u00f1os y Abel de 6 a\u00f1os, quienes la motivan a seguir  trabajando y sacarlos adelante y hacer de ellos unos hombres de bien, \u00fatiles a la sociedad.

They have two children, Elba aged 8 and Able aged 6. They are the reason why Alejandra and Teofilo work so hard; they wish to see their children grow up to make something of themselves and become a useful part of society. They live in their own house located in Pichari district.\r\n\r\nEver since she was a child, Alejandra has enjoyed helping her parents with any jobs they gave her, but her parents knew very little about economics. The store she used to run and which provided their income failed, and their agricultural business also fell through. Alejandra and her family had many problems but over time, they succeeded in overcoming them and with much sacrifice they now have a store where she sells clothing.\r\n\r\nAlejandra has now learned to be cautious with the business decisions she makes and is doing better. Sometimes she has assistance from Teofilo but usually she works on her own. She runs the store out of her house. \r\n\r\nIn the near future her wish is to better stock the store so she can gain more customers. This will be her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, for which she is grateful and promises to make the repayments punctually. In her community bank she is a enthusiastic and motivated member. With the loan of S\/. 2000, Alejandra will buy more clothing for the store.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":802401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-07-10T12:03:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312331,"name":"Fernanda Susana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela La Paz en la ciudad de Portoviejo, conocida desde tiempos coloniales como la Ciudad de Los Reales Tamarindos, cada quince d\u00edas se re\u00fanen las socias del Banco Comunal 5 De Septiembre.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Fernanda, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene dos hijos de 10 y 3 a\u00f1os de edad, el mayor  estudian en escuela.

She is separated and lives with her three daughters: Jessica, 17; Diana, 15; and Adaluz, 9. Nelly is a person who likes to move forward with her life and pull herself up without fear of falling down. She is simply a hardworking woman who is dedicated to her children. Nelly is a seamstress who manufactures sportswear and clothing. She used to work at home, but with a previous loan she purchased a store. She is requesting this loan, her 10th, to buy fabric and materials to fulfill a large order of sports uniforms. She works alone, but her daughter Diana helps her in her free time away from school. Her past loans have helped her expand her business. She now carries more goods, has more supplies, and carries more colors and sizes. She has been able to buy more machines and has given economic stability to her daughters.

She has already received and successfully repaid seven loans from Kiva partner, Patan Business and Professional Women, and used her most recent loan to buy grocery goods for her shop. In the future, Shanti plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<br>In the Kathmandu Valley, a small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":283.33,"image":{"id":802533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy grocery goods for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-07-03T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743311,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594772,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5107.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691512,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647877,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865010,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257274994,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416460,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-03T22:57:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312411,"name":"Nhessa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nhessa is 48 years old and married with four children.

She thanks you for your support. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires.  Its gases can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":283.33,"image":{"id":802536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743312,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594773,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T08:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265712,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-25T09:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691513,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647878,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865011,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257274995,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416461,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T02:06:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312414,"name":"Sita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sita is 50 years-old .

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.

is 30 years old.  She is married and has one child, who is four years old.  In 2005, she established  her grocery store business.  Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to increase the inventory of her store.  In the future, Muniya plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.  In the Kathmandu Valley, a small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.

The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":233.33,"image":{"id":802554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Subdra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2083,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2102.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743318,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2084,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2103.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594780,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2082.99,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T08:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2102.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265719,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2083.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-17T09:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2102.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691520,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2084,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2103.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647885,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2082.98,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2102.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865017,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2083.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2102.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275002,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2084,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2103.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416468,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T04:55:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312427,"name":"Monina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monina is 58 years old and is a widow with three children.

47 years old, is a farmer and fish seller with her husband. Their income is $8 per day. They have 6 children, four are studying. \r\n\r\nEvery month, Thy spends $47 on food, $5 on electricity, $30 on school fees, and $10 on transportation. She would like to request a loan of $1000 to buy three cattle for doing farming. Previously, her husband was a soldier for about 15 years. The income of a soldier is too small to support the family, so he decided to stop being a soldier and began helping his wife to earn money.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a member of UIMCEC since 2006 and has already taken out three loans which he has repaid on time. Now, he is asking for a fourth loan of 400,000 FCFA in order to buy new plumbing tools, including 9 keys, 2 spades, 3 shovels, 6 hammers, 7 blades and a new engine for his motorbike. These materials will help him equip his apprentices to send them to his different worksites, and help with their transport.\nWith the profits gained from his investments, the borrower will be better able to take care of the responsibilities of purchasing food for his family, educating his brothers and caring for his mother. He will also be able to increase his savings and add more employees. His ambition is to buy a car so that he can start working in other cities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":583.33,"image":{"id":802316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

She gets additional income from her rental houses.\r\n\r\nNaom has obtained a loan of 46,800 Kenyan shillings from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

Il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 ouvrir une petite mercerie dont il a confi\u00e9 la gestion \u00e0 sa petite soeur.Son activit\u00e9 a de relles opportunit\u00e9s pour reussir car le march\u00e9 de la couture est tres large et la demande est forte aussi bien dans sa localit\u00e9 qu' \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger.\n. C'est pourquoi, il demande un cr\u00e9dit de 350 000f pour augmenter ses marchandises en achetant notamment 4 machines \u00e0 coudre, du fils et des garnitures.Il n' a jamais sollicite de pr\u00eats \u00e0 l'IMCEC bien que soci\u00e9taire de cette institution depuis 2008.\nLes b\u00e9n\u00e9fices tir\u00e9s de ce financement pourront lui permettre  d\u2019augmenter  et de diversifier les produits de sa mercerie, de se lancer dans la vente de pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9tach\u00e9es de machine \u00e0 coudre. Il pourra \u00e9galement mieux supporter les charges sociales de la famille qui p\u00e8sent lourd sur lui (location, alimentation, \u00e9ducation \u2026).\nSon ambition est de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer assez de revenus pour se lancer dans l\u2019importation de mat\u00e9riels et de fournitures pour la couture.Il reve de construire une maison pour y loger sa famille.\n","en":"Always busy in his sewing machine repair workshop, the borrower became the head of his family of 10 people after the death of his father. He is married and has three children. All family expenses (rent, food, education, health, utilities) fall on his shoulders and amount to 225,000 francs a month. The family is living from hand to mouth, such that four people sleep in a single room. \r\n\r\nHis day begins very early, at 6:30 am, and sometimes he works through the night when it is a big holiday. He repairs broken sewing machines and also buys new or used machines from wholesalers and then resells them retail to tailors. He has also managed to open a little sewing notions shop which he has  his little sister manage. His business has real opportunities to succeed since the market for tailored goods is very big and there is plenty of demand, in his own locality and elsewhere. \r\n\r\nThis is why he is asking for a loan of 350,000 francs to grow his stock of merchandise by buying in particular four sewing machines, some thread, and accessories. He has never asked for a loan from IMCEC even though he has been a member since 2008. \r\n\r\nThe profit from this loan will allow him to add to his stock and diversify the products in his sewing notions business and get into selling spare parts for sewing machines. He will also be able to deal better with family expenses, which are quite a burden for him (rent, food, education, etc.)\r\n\r\nHis ambition is  to generate enough income to get into importing sewing materials and supplies. He dreams of building a house for his family to live in. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":800282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"tp buy sewing machines, thread, and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2011-06-28T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227123275,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232885186,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238703311,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244660479,"comment":null},{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":233333.32,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":236903.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250881203,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T13:11:02Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:29:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312552,"name":"Augustin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Augustin is 28 years old.

One of the members is Librada. She is 21 years old, has two children under school age, and makes a living selling all kinds of clothing. She says that she sacrifices all of her days for her children to assure them a dignified and decent life. She dreams that one day she can have a small sales post where she can offer her merchandise without leaving her children behind. She is requesting the loan to be able to purchase more clothing to then sell. She has a small supply, but she would like to buy clothing during the current winter season. Her hopes rest with this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":800607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase all kinds of clothing to later sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Asunci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T03:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Librada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barbara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estanilaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilsia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":6475603,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":404726},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":404713}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":3237808,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3258756.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221675689,"comment":null},{"amount":515.63,"local_amount":2023630,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2036722.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227044667,"comment":null},{"amount":309.37,"local_amount":1214165,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1222020.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232805602,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-01T19:31:06Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:08:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":312565,"name":"Norah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norah is a single mother and has a 2-year-old daughter.
