She lives in Proper, Brgy. Azagra, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. <p>\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)-Project Dungganon since 2001, and she has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her tailoring  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of 4,000 PHP. <p>\r\n\r\nRodolfa is now seeking to borrow 20,000 PHP ($450) so that she can purchase additional fabric. Notably, this would be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her last loan, which was in the amount of 18,000 PHP and which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Rodolfa aspires to improve her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, NWTF is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").  Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 per day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.  They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, which is a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":561887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To

A. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Pansil, Brgy. Azagra, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by buying and selling rice.  Her husband, Rico, who is 52 years old, works as a laborer to earn a living.  They have five children, who are between the ages of 18 and 30 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nLucena joined Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 16 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own hard work, Lucena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her last loan in the amount of 10,000 PHP enabled her to earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, which helped to improve her family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is seeking to borrow 10,000 PHP ($225), which she intends to use to purchase additional fertilizer and rice. In turn, she hopes to continue to save up so that she can purchase a tricycle and perform home repairs. Lucena A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, NWTF is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").  Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 per day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.  They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, which is a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

They have four children ranging in age from 14 to  29 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nLaneta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Laneta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,500, thereby raising the family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000 to buy stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and do home repairs. Laneta O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a community member who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":561865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

T. was born in Chaldovar (Panfilov region, Kyrgyz Republic), where she still lives. She is 57 years old. She was the third child in a large, low-income family. Because she had to help her mother in the household from early childhood, she left secondary school after the 7th grade. Damira got married at the age of 22. Soon she gave a birth to a son and two daughters. At that time Damira\u2019s husband started breeding sheep. It was not a very profitable activity and additional earnings were required in order to support their family. That\u2019s why, without education and practical knowledge, Damira decided get into sales.\r\n\r\nDamira started, as do many people in her situation, selling at a local market. Her start as an entrepreneur was successful due to strong efforts. Starting with a capital of only 2,000 Kyrgyz Som, she managed to multiply her investments within one year. After five years of selling groceries in the market, Damira managed to purchase a sales stall and open up a small grocery store near her house. From this moment the shop became a family business. Her grown up children started to help their mother in the shop. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Damira obtained her first loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz Som from Bai Tushum and Partners. She used it to construct a shop on her own land. Her activity started to bring in permanent profit and her clientele increased.\r\n\r\nThen a tragic accident happened: her only son had a car accident. He needed expensive medical treatment. At the same time, Damira\u2019s granddaughter was born, which further increased the family\u2019s expenditures.\r\n\r\nDamira wants to take a loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz Som to expand the range of products in her shop. She hopes that this will help her increase her revenue. In the future, Damira plans to buy an apartment for her son in Karabalta and marry her daughters off well. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Kiva borrowers benefit from a 5% discount on the interest rate if they pay back without

is a 47-year-old mother of eight. She is a native of Talim Island from the town of Binangonan, which is located in Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is happily living with her 8 children and her 48-year-old husband, Virgilio, who is a bamboo set maker (furniture maker). \r\n\r\nEufronia dreams of escaping the circle of poverty. She joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2000 with hope of having access to capital to start a business. She and her husband are partners in their bamboo set making business. Since then her business has continued to grow and provide good income for her family but income from business in not enough to sustain everyday needs; therefore the couple now requests a much larger loan in the amount of 18,000 PHP for a bigger profits. The loan will be used to pay for inventory of raw materials of her business.\r\n\r\nEufronia is looking forward to increased demand for bamboo sets (furniture) on the island and in nearby towns so that their business will grow and generate enough income for her family. She dreams of sending her children to school until they finish college and find a stable living arrangement. She also hopes to build a new concrete, durable house for secure and comfortable living conditions.  Her long-term goal is to launch a new fishing business for additional income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":564193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

Her husband, Jonathan, who is 35 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 4 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nMary Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, thus improving the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 28,000 PHP which she intends to use for her business so that she can continue to save up for her future and for the education of her children. Mary Grace A. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

Over the course of her loan term, she consistently paid on time, and she even repaid the full loan amount earlier than her scheduled end date.  \r\n\r\nToday, she is hoping to borrow $1,500 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. in order to purchase much-needed tailoring supplies.

R. is a 43-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  a <i>sari sari<\/i> (general store) and a fish vending business. She lives in Sitio Canibol, Brgy. Okiot, Bais City, Negros Oriental. \r\n\r\nLudy has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari sari store and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nLudy is borrowing 19,000 PHP as additional capital for her sari sari store. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP ( which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom. Ludy hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and

They have six children who are 13 to 33 years old. \r\n\r\nIgnacia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ignacia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 20,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 16,800 PHP, thus improving the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing 20,500 PHP which she intends to use to purchase piglets and as additional capital for her main business so that she can continue to save up for the future and for the education of her children.

She now earns an average monthly income of 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nJeniffer is borrowing 27,000 PHP to use for her businesses. This will be her tenth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom.

Together they reside in their own home in the town of Quimbiri, which is located in the beautiful Cusco jungle.  Susan is the type of person who likes working as part of a team.  For this reason, she and her partner decided to open a business selling beverages.  At first they encountered financial difficulties, but over time they were able to recover.  They currently supplement this business by selling food, specifically traditional jungle cuisine, so that they can increase their earnings.  Their vending stall is located near the police station and is open for business from 7am until 10pm.

D. is a 57-year-old married woman who lives in Barangay Bunakan, Madredijos, Bantayan Island in the Province of Cebu.

Some of the children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\n\nFlorencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fish-vending and selling dried fish. \n\nFlorencia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations of her fish-vending and dried fish business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions.\n\nNow, Florencia is borrowing Php 20,000 for her 19th loan which she intends to use on her fish-vending and dried fish business. She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\n\n About NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":563385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To use as

J. is a 58-year old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures:  egg production, food vending and ready-to-wear (RTW) clothing sales.  She lives in Prk. Takas, Brgy. Enclaro, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. <p>\r\n\r\nA member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998, Estrella has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her three businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP15,000. <p>\r\n\r\nEstrella is now borrowing PHP 29,500, her 23rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, to buy feeds for laying mash.  Her previous loan of PHP29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Estrella aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a community member who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

San Vicente, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Ariel, who is 43 years old, works as a Cane Truck Driver to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business. They have 2 children who are 10 and 12 years old.\r\n<p>\r\nChristy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Christy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, helping to raise the family's standard of living.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her 18th cycle loan Christy is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save for future home repairs and the educaton of her children. Christy C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n<\/em><p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They live together in their own home in the town of Quimbiri, which is located in the beautiful jungle of Cusco.  Victoria is known for being an enterprising and hardworking woman who sells clothing at the moment.

Nonetheless, she is able to maintain a steady level of business and now has more customers and her sales have been gradually increasing.  Victoria has learned many lessons from her competition and has already improved several aspects of her business.   She now stocks clothes for all tastes and preferences and sells them to her customers at a reasonable price.  Her vending post is situated in the local market, where she works from 7am until 8pm.  Victoria is determined to succeed and later plans to expand her business to other areas in order to position herself in the marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

Virginia sells typical food and Creole food, a business that she learned from her parents, and now the seasoning with which she prepares her food delights her customers. She remembers that to set up her business, she had to put out flyers, and that was when people began to go to her little, unknown corner, and since then, her most demanding customers come every day to taste the variety of dishes that she prepares. Every day she tries to improve, with the goal of satisfying and giving better service to her customers. She generally works with an assistant from 7 in the morning until 8 at night. Her plan for the future is to increase her business, adding a soda fountain, in order to give her restaurant a new style.

A. is 63 years old and has been married to Carmelo Fern\u00e1ndez Corrales for more than 40 years. They have 1 son, who studies at secondary school. Carmelo grows potatoes, broad beans, and corn on his 1-hectare plot of land in the rural community of Rodeo Melga. Emiliana helps Carmelo on the plot, looks after cattle, and takes care of their house.  \r\n\r\nEmiliana and her family live in Rodeo Melga, which is 33 km away from the city. This makes it very difficult for them to get to a bank to request a loan. The field partner, EL CIDRE, took the initiative to go to this rural area and discovered that Emiliana needed capital to increase their potato, broad bean and corn yields.

Being a young student, she benefits from her friendships that allow her to sell more clothing.  More than 6 months ago she began to sell these products, and in this way she has control over the products that she sells and requests loans for.  She is always on top of new fashion trends so that she can offer her customers good options for purchase.  For this reason she travels to Lima every other week to restock her merchandise.  She desires to increase her wares to earn a greater profit and be able to pay her own bills.  This is her second loan with MFP and she is very happy to be part of the community bank because they are all very punctual with their loans.  She is very responsible with her payments and thanks the people who will provide the loan she is requesting--a loan that will be very useful for her business' progress.  She will use the requested loan to invest in purchasing more women's clothing to sell. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva

single has not limited Elenie B.\u2019s opportunity to feel what it is like to raise children and to take care of their needs every day. At home, she is accompanied by a nephew and niece. She makes them feel loved and is helping in making their lives comfortable. In a way, she feels as though she is the real mother of her loving nephew and niece. From them, she draws out strength and determination to work hard and improve their standard of living. Nevertheless, Elenie still looks forward to having her own family in the future. But, meanwhile, she wants to be financially stable. \r\n\r\nTo be able to reach her dream of having a stable source of income to support her above-mentioned aspirations, she joined ASHI in 2003. Loans made to her since then until the present have enabled her to start raising hogs and buying and selling them as a business. All throughout her membership, Elenie has never been a problem for her co-members in terms of payment. \r\n\r\nShe believes that fate has been good to her without giving her a hard time to manage her business. After four months of raising her hogs, she sells them either alive or slaughtered to people in her village and sometimes in the market. Along with that, she also buys different commodities for selling. \r\n\r\nElenie enjoys spending the small profit she earns through the business to give her niece and nephew necessary things. However, thinking about a better kind of house to comfort and shelter her and the children she is taking care of, the urge to grow her business further becomes so intense. Because of that, she is requesting a much larger amount of loan for the financial capital growing her business requires.

Living a life for 28 years that offers very few opportunities to grow as a person and for enjoyment makes her so determined to make herself a successful businesswoman in the future and bring her family out from under the umbrella of poverty. \r\n\r\nWith these visions, Marivic joined ASHI in 2008. She has received a loan since then and has been able to start up a \u201csari- sari\u201d store for a business.  \u201cSari-sari\u201d means that various foodstuffs, beverages and an assortment of grocery items are sold in a small, open room of their house. For Marivic and her family, the small profit her store is gaining is a great help to augment the sporadic and small income of her husband, who works as a hired laborer.  \r\n\r\nThrough the loan she

D. lives in Zavhan province in western Mongolia with his wife and two children. He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent. His youngest child currently attends a local primary school while the elder son stays at home taking care of the family members. Enh-Amgalan operates a small sewing business in his town with the help of his younger sister. He repairs and produces a variety of clothing items and ger curtain covers for his customers at a small workspace. Enh-Amgalan started his sewing business in 2007 by himself, but is now partnered with his sister in the business.\r\n\r\nHis business is very important for him and his family as it is their only source of income. He has worked hard and found some success, but struggles to support both of his children and sick wife who has suffered from brucellosis. With his business earnings, he was able to build a new small house which is 30% in the process of construction while changing his own ger cover and curtain in full. For the future, Enh-Amgalan hopes to progress his business to provide local citizens with necessary ger materials and make permanent supplement at lowest prices. He says \"I hope to one day own my own workspace and hire some people in order to expand my business.\" He is requesting a 1,400,000 MNT loan to purchase fabrics and materials for his sewing business.

S. is 46 years old and a very simple woman. She has tried to enjoy her life to the fullest despite being poor. When she became a mother to her two children, the urge to discover her potential to be productive and help her husband earn money for their living pre-occupied her thoughts. This has intensified with her eldest child going to college, the second in high school. \r\n\r\nWith determination to graduate her children from college and improving their standard of living, she joined ASHI in 2003. The first loan she received was used to finance and grow a vegetable business. This kind of livelihood activity is the most common source of income of the many families in the village where Evelyn and her family live. Every day they go to different municipalities to market their products. Evelyn works hard with her husband to bring home money to support to the needs of their children. Given the opportunity to have larger amount of capital, Evelyn and her husband hope to make their business stable and profitable. Through this, they will be able to make life enjoyable for their children until they are capable of living their own lives away from poverty.

O., 38 years old, is from the village of Maputi, Naawan, Misamis Oriental. Merelyn is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Merelyn owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling of bags in the local community. Merelyn has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials for the business. Merelyn is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw items to expand product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Merelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Maksim\u2019s wife helps him a lot with this hard work.\r\n    \r\nNow Maksim is asking for a 1,000,000 AMD loan to buy potato seedlings and fertilizer for his farm. (This spring, the weather in Sevan region was very rainy, so villagers are forced to plant the seeds in the summer months.)  \r\n

She is in a common law marriage and is the mother of a 21 year old daughter who goes to school. She studied through 9th grade and stopped when she moved in with her husband. She lives in her own home with her granddaughter and supports two stepchildren who live with her. \r\n\r\nWhen she moved in with her husband she found a job a the Namaacha Health Center as a janitor where she works from 7:30am to 3:30pm and makes 2,200 meticais per month which goes to house expenses. Due to the fact that her stepson will inherit the house they live in, she is registering a lot of land in her daughter's name. She is requesting Hluvuku and Kiva for a loan to start building a house there. Her husband, who is a bricklayer, will build the house.  \r\n\r\nThis is Sandra's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva and it is for 10,000 meticais. She intends to use it purchase construction materials (local stone, cement, sand) and start building a house for her daughter. She is confident she will pay back the loan ahead of time since she will have help from her husband who is a bricklayer. Her biggest dream is to be legally married and to have a suitable life. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

Today he is a retired teacher and has been making 3,034.56 meticais per month for more than 8 years. Besides earning his pension, he works as a gardener making 1,800 meticais per month. He also raises chicks owning a chicken coop where he raises on average 3 boxes. He spends 20,000 meticais making a profit of 1,800 meticais per month in case the weather is not too cold. He uses the money for household expenses and manages to put some money in his savings account.\r\n\r\nHe has had a loan in the amount of 30,000 meticais with BIM, which is almost paid for. This is loan, in the amount of 15,000 meticais, is Adriano's first with Hluvuku and Kiva. He intends to buy chicks to raise and resell. He is confident that he will pay the loan back ahead of time. Based on this loan, he will assess if it is worth it to raise chicks with loans before requesting others.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

Romulo has been engaged in his business for 7 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Romulo joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Romulo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which was used as additional capital for his business. Romulo is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used for the expansion of the business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Romulo from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve his family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Five years ago, Salvacion decided to help her husband and became involved in the food-selling business, specializing in \"puso\", or hanging rice, and native vinegar.

He is married and father to 4 children who are 5, 14 and 20 years old. All children go to school. He studied until the 10th grade but didn't finish school because he was drafted. He lives in his own home with his family and also supports two sisters who live with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Beira when he was drafted and was in mandatory military service during 6 years. After leaving the service he took teacher's training. He has had a permanent job with Principal's level for more than 27 years. He makes 7,750 meticais per month, which is used for household expenses. He has started construction with a loan obtained from BIM. He has not finished construction and now comes to Hluvuku to request a loan to continue it.   \r\n\r\nThis is Fernando's second loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva, in the amount of 20,000 meticais. He intends to purchase construction materials (cement, iron, sand and zinc sheets) to continue construction. His previous loan, in the amount of 10,000 meticais, was used for the same goal. \r\n\r\nHe is confident he will pay the loan back ahead of schedule and request another loan to build a pottery\/brick

Nurlan Manapovich was born in Orlovka village (Kemin region) where he still lives at the moment. He\u2019s 37 years old. After graduating from school he went into the army. After this, he married Kanaeva Raihan, with whom he has four children: three daughters of school age and a little son who is only one and a half years old. Nurlan works as a security guard in the Altynken goldmine. Nurlan\u2019s spouse is a housewife.\r\n\r\nSince Nurlan is the only breadwinner in a large family, being a hard-working, responsible and enterprising man, he decided to open up a small shop in his garage three years ago. The garage was refurbished into a shop within one week. With a part of his salary of 3,000 Kyrgyz Soms, Nurlan bought groceries. The range of products in his corner shop was not sufficient, and after thinking for a while and considering all the risks, Nurlan got his first loan from Bai Tushum & Partners. Thus, he could widen the range of products and his shop, which he runs with his wife and older children (in their spare time), allows them to earn some extra money. The shop is open 24\/7 and Nurlan has his permanent customers, to whom he gives some discounts and, in case of need, lends goods.\r\n\r\nAbout one month ago, Nurlan\u2019s shop was robbed. More than half of the goods (with a value of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms) and the sale proceeds of a whole day were stolen. It was a big loss for Nurlan, but he quickly gathered his courage again. In view of the importance of the additional revenue from the shop for his family, Nurlan wants to obtain a loan of 40,000 Kyrgyz Soms to restock his shop with products.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing for Nurlan is his family; he wants to provide his children with a good education.

Gitta started her general merchandise retail shop in Nyenga-Lugazi. With a modest savings from her farming and charcoal sells business, she embarked on this business. For this married mother of 6, determination and hard work have been the stock in trade attributes that she has banked on to give her business an edge. She has used profits from her business to not only give an improved lease on life to her family\u2019s welfare, but she has also used it as a ways and means of consolidating her business. In a week,her business generates her 250,000 shillings. She also still maintains her farming and charcoal making business. She envisions owning a wholesale business in the future.

She is married and the mother of 3 children who are 22, 19 and 14 years old. All children go to school. She only completed 6th grade and didn't finish school due to her parents' lack of financial resources. She lives in her own house with her family and supports two nieces who live with her. \r\n\r\nAfter 6th grade Lurdes moved in with her husband and started living in the Namaacha District, Province of Maputo. With her husband's help, she built a small shop in her house as a way to increase the family's income. She sells household staples and her best selling products are \"bingo\" soap, corn flour, beans and rice by the kilo. She has a daily income of 800 meticais and manages to save 1,000 meticais per month. \r\n\r\nThis loan, in the amount of 15,000 meticais is her fourth with Hluvuku and Kiva. She intends to buy merchandise (corn flour, beans, rice, soap and others) to increase her inventory. The previous loans were for 10,000, 10,500 and 15,000 meticais and were used for the same goal.\r\n\r\nShe is confident she will pay the loan ahead of schedule.

It can be used in many ways to get oneself out of narrow circumstances. This reality in today\u2019s Uganda, where everybody is looking for a white collar job, has not sunk in fully. It goes without saying that Farming, has from time in memorial, been the backbone of most business in Uganda. Many families subsisted on it to start other businesses, educate their children and to make ends meet. One individual who did not gloss over this reality is one high spirited 38 year married mother of 4, who goes by the name of A. Harriet. With enough savings from her farming business, she began a retail shop 10 years ago in Buikwe-Lugazi.  For a person who describes herself as a hard worker, it is no surprise that her business has made progress through the course of the last 10 years. In a month, she has been making profits that have consistently totaled up to 600,000 shillings. Like any other business person who aims at making more profits, she is taking a long view with plans of transforming into a wholesale business. She is optimistic that with this loan coming her way and with an additional source of income coming through her rental business, she will be able to make ends meet. With it, she is planning on purchasing more retail stock like sugar, basins, cups, rice, beans, soap, etc that she will be able to resell to earn more profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4175,"image":{"id":564749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Thanks to her good quality work, her customers recommend her to the people they know.  They seek her out, even at home.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy materials like:  different colors of crepe paper, cardboard, glue, ribbon, and stick on eyes.  \r\n\r\nHer plan is to be able to put a roof on the space meant for her pi\u00f1atas so they are not damaged.\r\n\r\nAna, like the rest of the members, wants to meet her expectations in order to have a better future for her family.

Prossy is a 50-year-old woman with a sparkly sense of humor. This has helped her strike a chord with most of her clients at her firewood sales business in Mbiko Kasanja-Lugazi. M. Prossy has, over the last 4 years, defied the stereotype that aging people like herself should just rely on their children and grandchildren to survive. Contrary to expectation, she has managed to establish a niche for herself amidst strong competition from other firewood sellers in a region where firewood can easily be obtained from the neighboring mabire forest. At her age, she is surprisingly single but happy with her status saying she is in a position to provide for all her 4 children without the support of a man. That to her matters more than anything else. \r\n\r\nM. Prossy began this business with savings from her teaching job. Hard work is also a factor that she attributes to her success. As she makes progress on the 120,000 UGX she makes in a week, she is also taking a long view. She says she wants to eventually open new business horizons for herself in the near future by opening up a grocery store. She is getting remuneration as a teacher since she is still in active service. With this loan, she is looking at buying more firewood to sell to her increasing clientele to earn more profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":564892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-09T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mustafah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Masaazi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2400000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:14Z","rounded_local_amount":607366.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689428,"comment":null},{"amount":279.3,"local_amount":623550,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":631205.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903577,"comment":null},{"amount":325.39,"local_amount":726450,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":735368.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297050,"comment":null},{"amount":201.56,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":455524.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467324,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-10T11:09:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":212979,"name":"Micaela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Micaela R. tiene m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o dedic\u00e1ndose a la venta de ropa nueva y novedades.\nEsta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo ya que le esta haciendo falta mas variedad de mercanc\u00eda y no cuenta con el capital necesario para la inversi\u00f3n y no quiere descapitalizar su negocio ya que es la fuente de ingresos de su familia. \nEs por eso que solicita su cooperaci\u00f3n en este cr\u00e9dito, y as\u00ed su negocio tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda para la venta. \n","en":"Mrs. Micaela R. has worked for more than a year selling new clothing and novelty items.

Her business has done very well since it is near a high school and a kindergarten.  She sells more when the school day ends.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy French fries, fritters, milk candy called \u201cDuvalin\u201d, lollipops covered in chili powder, tamarind candy called \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pelon_Pelo_Rico\" target=\"_blank\" >Pel\u00f3n Pelo Rico<\/a>\u201d, and other products.

The group is made up 5 members who have known each other for some time.  This is their first loan with Fundacion Realidad.\r\nThe group's organizer is Mrs. Reyna S. G. who is 39 years old and has completed 3 years of a high school education.  She has 3 Children: Victor Eduardo, a 20 year old male, Omar is a 17 year old male, and Aline Berenice, a 6 year old female.  Mrs. G. buys and sells gold and silver jewelry. The business originated 3 years ago after a friend she used to sell with moved away so she decided to sell gold and silver jewelry to her neighbors. She now sells her jewelry door to door and travels to Iguala every 15 days to stock up on merchandise. She will be using her loan to purchase studs, chains, medals, earrings, rings, and bracelets.  She likes her business very much because she doubles her investment, it allows her to care for her children, and it serves as a distraction. She re-invests her earnings and only takes out when her children need something for school.  Members of the group are:\r\n Ana Maria M. R. who will use the loan to stock up on merchandise like: milk, soda beverages, sugar, soups, cooking oil, dried spices, soap, etc., so she can stock her store.  \r\nGodeleva P. P. will purchase bed sheets, quilts, sleeping garments, and towels to stock her business.  \r\nElena O. H. will purchase, sheets, and bed spreads in bulk since she sells them individually.  Catalina H. S. will be purchasing men and women's shoes.  \r\nMembers of the group are very happy with the loan given by Fundacion Realidad and Kiva because it allows them to grow their businesses and families.

The group consists of four members who know each other and are neighbors.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the group members is Violeta A. A..  She is 40 years old and completed her studies through the third year of secondary school.  She has two children, a son and a daughter, both of whom are students:  David Alexis (age 15) and Diana Karen (age 11).  Violeta operates a butcher shop and will use her loan to buy live pigs so that she can sell the meat and other derivatives by the kilo.  The products that she offers include meat, steaks, pork rinds, meat enchiladas, longaniza sausage, lard, and pork wraps.  She started her business four years ago because she needed to earn more money for her family.  Violeta received assistance from her brother-in-law, who taught her everything she needed to know about running the business.  When her brother-in-law found it necessary to move away, she decided to take over the business and continue its operation.  Violeta\u2019s husband helps with killing and butchering the pigs.  Her son is responsible for removing the fat from the hides and cleaning the floor.  She plans to reinvest some of her profits in the purchase of an electric meat grinder because she currently has a manual one.  In addition, she would like to buy a computer for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nVioleta\u2019s business is located in her house in Tepalcingo.  She likes her community because the people are very friendly.  A fair is held every third Friday for Lent, so she is able to see people who come from different places to visit the church.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the group are as follows:\r\n\u2022\tSra. Edith P. M. will use her loan to buy bread, vegetables, mayonnaise, meats, and fruits for preparing hamburgers and fruit cocktails.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Jacinta M.

Ernestina Casta\u00f1eda F. will buy perfumes, cosmetics, lipsticks, lip gloss, and other items.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Violeta A.

At the moment, I work as a full-time employee on the Espejo Family Estate, which is located in Valle del Carmen in the community of Yungaqui.  For 25 years I have worked with the family and my duties include milking the cows, watering the fields, planting and harvesting potatoes, and making cheese.  I also live in my own house and have small plots of land on which I plant and harvest seasonal crops.  When I started, it was difficult at first because I did not have much capital.  At that point, I was presented with the opportunity to join a Communal Bank with Asociaci\u00f3n Araiwa and receive support through monetary loans that I could use to start and improve my business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"From that point, life for myself and my family began to change because we had access to capital.  My wife and I, as well as our children, felt we could work toward changing the financial situation of our family.  At that moment, I wanted to grow my business.  I am currently requesting a loan to buy compost, seeds, and other supplies.  For this reason I am extremely grateful to my Communal Bank and Asociaci\u00f3n Araiwa because they have changed my life, not only financially, but socially as well.  No other financial institution wanted to trust us.  Most of them asked for too many requirements and suddenly we did not matter to them.

They chose this name because they like to fight to achieve their goals, and they very much identify with it. They are located in the community of Valle del Chalco in the State of Mexico. It is a close-knit group with a lot of communication among the members.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Mr. Valent\u00edn Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda (the man in the blue jacket), who is 32 years old and is proudly from the state of Oaxaca. He is single and sells tacos. He began working in a position that lasted two years, but he later decided to become independent and start his own business, which has been in operation for six years. He goes out each day with his cart to sell tacos, beginning at six o'clock in the evening. During the week he makes few sales, but his best days for sales are on weekends when he sometimes runs out of tacos in just three hours. He always tries to get good prices on his ingredients and provide high quality. His dreams are to be able to buy a small house for himself and, at some point, for his future family. He also wants to open a new taco stand in another community and create a job for someone, given that he sees that it is difficult to get a job right now.

Se\u00f1ora \u00c1ngela has a pharmacy and stationery business, and she is going to use the loan to buy patent medicines. She began the business 12 years ago, after taking a course in medicine, since the government required a person to take an examination to give them a license or permission to open a pharmacy. She is very proud of her business because she likes medicine and has been able to help people in emergencies, for example, she tells us, \"in case of a scorpion bite, or when a person doesn't have enough money at the moment to buy medicine, I give them the medicine and then they pay me; on one occasion a woman came alone for medicine, but she felt and looked very bad, I was able to help by taking her to her home and her family.\"  \u00c1ngela's business is in her home in Jaloxtoc. She tends kindly and personally to between 20 and 30 customers, both men and women, who come in for products that are very necessary for the health of the community. She hopes and dreams that we will always live quietly in peace.\r\n\r\nThe town of Jaloxtoc is a very peaceful place. There is a pond, which is El Jaguey. You can also see the hills, which in the rainy season are green and pretty.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are:  Adriana M. R..

He started his tailor business in the year 2000, working out of his home while his eldest sons who are now abroad helped him making all kinds of garments. At first he made clothing as much to take abroad as to sell since he traveled a lot and he could take the products, such as T-shirts, pants and lingerie, with him.

At this time, I need this loan in order to purchase materials like herbs and other supplies. \r\nFor all of this, I am very grateful to the the Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa Communal Bank because it has changed my life not only economically but also socially; before all of this, no other financial institute wanted to give us trust as they asked for many prerequisites that many of us did not have at that time. For this reason, I am very thankful since I now have my own capital and can manage my business better.
