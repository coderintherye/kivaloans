With this business, Emmanuel expects to earn more profit, which in turn will allow him to continue paying school fees for his children and reinvesting in his business for a better future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":533984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a large quantity of spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Byumba \/Gicumbi \/Rwanda","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145023003,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152782033,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709945,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037292,"comment":null},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":127564.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616602,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622802,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760627,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-09T19:47:10Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198086,"name":"Hernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hernando tiene 24 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa propia, al lado de sus padres y hermanos, en un barrio ubicado en la sierra central peruana.\n\nDesde muy peque\u00f1o se ha dedicado a la agricultura, en la actualidad trabaja junto a sus padres en la siembra papa, alverja y habas.

Farming is hard work as it requires much patience and dedication with the care of each of the plants not to be affected by plague and reach harvest in good condition. According to his words: \"in farming you win or you lose, but if you care properly for your crop you will get a good production\". Hernando likes his job because the profit from his sales allows him to live comfortably. What he does not like is that many times the price of potato is low, but the sale of pea and bean makes up for the loss. \r\n<p>\r\nAnd as he is a very entrepreneurial young man he thinks about the future and it is his plan to plant even more, especially pea as the price is stable on the national market.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is very grateful to all the people who made the money possible for him to continue his work.

This fishing port is a major exporter of Tuna to different parts of the world since it was the first one dedicated to that type of fish. Narcisa is a native of Manta and is a responsible woman dedicated to her job. She is 54 years old and maintains a stable home with four children. Her eldest son is 30 years old. Narcisa works at a fish factory and aside from this also makes a living selling clothing by informally visiting clients at their homes. She brings in her merchandise from the city of Guayaquil at a low price, buying it at wholesale so she can obtain better profits. She gave us an example of how much she is benefiting from Kiva's help by being able to go and buy from the distributors because for every $12 she spends she doubles her profit with each pant she sells. She has to keep in mind the costs of the trip that she has to make in order to find good merchandise. With this new loan, she plans to invest in the purchase of clothes for Mother's Day since that month is a good one for sales. Narcisa's dream is to have a food stand selling ceviche (popular fish dish) and sandwiches.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":534012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase pants and clothing for women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beata Narcisa De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709123,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892422,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632782,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846816,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T00:23:11Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198103,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana, de 42 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa propia en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo Juan de 47 a\u00f1os, que es chofer de bus de transporte p\u00fablico y juntos tiene 2 hijos, mayores de edad, pero solteros a\u00fan.

on the banks of the Pacific Ocean. Rosa is big merchant of fine silver jewelry and has a number of years of experience in the business. At 54 years old she is convinced her biggest passion is jewelry, and with her business she has been able to raise her children despite having the difficult task of being both their mother and father. She feels content that they are professionals. She started the business after being an artisan, and she learned crafts from a very young age at a shop. After a good amount of time she met a woman who offered her to take up selling jewelry brought in directly from the city of Cuenca. Many of the years she spent the majority of her time working on orders. She developed the business as follows: She purchases the merchandise from a wholesaler in Cuenca who brings it to the city of Guayaquil; once it is delivered to Rosa, she splits the supplies with 20 people who are in charge of taking the jewelry to sell throughout the country. With this new loan, Rosa plans to purchase more jewelry. She would like to have her own jewelry store in the city of Manta and doesn't rule out the possibility. She has even talked to a person who distributes the jewelry to give her a chance to realize her dream.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":534016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase jewelry at wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T04:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709124,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892423,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632783,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846817,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T07:10:06Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198107,"name":"Luisa Solanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Luisa es socia de la Fundaci\u00f3n desde hace 4 a\u00f1os en los actuales momentos es socia del Banco Comunal Umi\u00f1a en Manta primer puerto atunero del Ecuador a orillas del Pacifico.\n\nNuestra socia se dedica al comercio de frutas, plantas y ropa, quiz\u00e1s parezca una combinaci\u00f3n algo rara pero es as\u00ed como ella junto a su esposo se ganan la vida, ya son 7 a\u00f1os en este negocio en Tarqui una parroquia de Manta con gran asentamiento comercial en la zona,   \n\nEmpez\u00f3 con el negocio con un dinero que ten\u00eda ahorrado pero necesitaba de mas capital porque sus ventas fueron en aumento y ten\u00eda que surtir su almac\u00e9n pero fue ah\u00ed que una amiga le hablo para que ingrese al banco comunal, y desde entonces le va muy bien con los cr\u00e9ditos y ha ido incrementando su negocio.\n\nEn los actuales momentos la se\u00f1ora Luisa invertir\u00e1 su nuevo cr\u00e9dito en gran parte a la ropa y el restante para surtir su negocio de las frutas,  junto al esposo trabajan en un local que le han dado los suegros, quien empez\u00f3 con el negocio fue el esposo, y despu\u00e9s fue la se\u00f1ora Luisa que invirti\u00f3 en la mercader\u00eda de ropa porque una hermana de ella que vive en los Estados Unidos  le env\u00eda la ropa, zapatos, cartearas y bisuter\u00eda.\n\nDesde hace 10 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 en uni\u00f3n con su esposo, no han podido tener hijos, pero han sabido superarlo, ahora est\u00e1n dedicados a su negocio, el sue\u00f1o de nuestra socia es tener una boutique de primera para brindarle mayor comodidad a sus clientes.\n\n","en":"Luisa has been a member of Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR for four years.

Mariana sells chicken, drinks, and is very content to live with her parents, which helps them a lot.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":534027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy drinks, meat, and general provisions for her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T09:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariana Del Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":715,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":181.26,"local_amount":178.76,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":181.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709127,"comment":null},{"amount":181.26,"local_amount":178.76,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":181.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892426,"comment":null},{"amount":181.26,"local_amount":178.76,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":181.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632786,"comment":null},{"amount":181.22,"local_amount":178.72,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":181.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846820,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-13T07:12:13Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198113,"name":"Kwagala Development Group, Mpigi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is the story of K.

the community bank, Umi\u00f1a, in an area of the same name. A member of the community bank, Viviana, 27 years old, lives here with her husband, 28 years, and two children. The couple has been married for 11 years. They had made their lives originally in the capital of Quito where they worked in a food outlet. However, once their work contract expired, they were left with nothing, and decided to return to their native town of Manta to see what work they could find. \n\nAfter a serious discussion with her husband, Viviana and her husband decided to set up their own food stand using their modest savings to invest in the business. Viviana\u2019s husband bought a cart and elaborately adapted it to suit the needs of the business. Viviana put her cooking skills into practice. The couple sought permission from the council in order to station their cart in an area three houses away from where they both lived, and once permission had been granted, Viviana and her husband began working and have continued to do so for the past two years. \n\nEach day, the couple has to move their cart from their house to a car park (parking lot), where the council has granted them permission to run their business and which is three blocks away in a busy area of the city. The food cart offers typical regional fare. \n\nThe loan will be used to buy food and a tent to protect them from the rain. Their strong sales will help them repay their loan installments on time. Viviana tells us that she started her business with just $70 and now she continues investing more and more. Though they took an initial risk in setting up the business, they have never regretted the decision.     \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":534033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy provisions and an awning for their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viviana Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709128,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892427,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632787,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846821,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-06T18:26:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198115,"name":"Celestin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celestin is 26 years old and single.

The story is that many years ago when it was  not yet a city they planted many tamarind trees in what are now the city streets, and that is how it got this name.\r\n\r\nUpon visiting this bank we spoke with Carmen, a single mother with six children. She is a native of Portoviejo and lives in the Orquideas, a low-income neighborhood in the city. She works selling clothing, underwear, bras, hosiery and more. She buys her products in Guayquil, where she travels every two months. Depending on how her business is going she invests between 400 and 500 dollars on merchandise. She makes her living selling her products door-to-door in her neighborhood and others nearby. She sells her merchandise on credit, collecting payments every week. She has had this business for 17 years. Being a member of the foundation has helped her overcome problems and grow her business. With this new loan she will supply her business with more merchandise. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":534077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase underwear, hosiery, bras","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cira Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709133,"comment":null},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":206.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":206.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892432,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632792,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846826,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T18:43:34Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198136,"name":"Ingrid","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ingrid M.

R.. \r\n\r\nRasoolan gave birth to four children: two sons and two daughters. Her elder son reads in 2nd standard and the others have no occupation. Rasoolan is a very talented lady; she manages her clothes-selling business. She receives order from her neighbors and relatives. She purchases clothing from different cities (especially Multan & Lahore) because of their cheap rates and good designs. She has been operating this business for the last 3 years. Her income helps her to share the financial burden with her husband. \r\n\r\nHer husband sells vehicle tyres (rubber edging for wheels) in the market. He has been in this business for over 25 years. He has obtained a good reputation among his customers. He sells quality materials in his shop which attracts more customers.  \r\n\r\nRasoolan has been a client of Asasah (a micro-finance institute in Pakistan) for the last three years.

P. is from the village of Cabol-Anonan, Tudela, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling personal home products to local community members. Fely has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Fely joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fely has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Fely is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Fely from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Elvy owns and operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.

Elvy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. Elvy is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Elvy from PMPC.

She is 55 years old. Lolita is the group leader for a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nLolita is married and has four grown children. To make a living, Lolita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Lolita has been engaged in her business for over 8 years, and she earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2001, Lolita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lolita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 18th loan taken out by Lolita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC: <br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Calamba Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda C. is from the village of Katipunan, Sinacabn, Misamis Occidental. She is 45 years old. Erlinda is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nErlinda is married and has 3 children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 1200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Erlinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Erlinda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Regil Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucila R. is from the village of Senor, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental. She is 58 years old. Lucila is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLucila is married and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Lucila owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting corn for sale. Lucila has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Lucila joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase general farm supplies & equipment. Lucila is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 12th loan taken out by Lucila from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Torayno Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina T. is from the village of Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 43 years old. Gina is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGina is married and has 2 children. To make a living, Gina owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 1600 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Gina is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Gina from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Potutan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phebe P. is from the village of Mansabay Bajo. She is 39 years old. Phebe is the group leader for a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are each responsible for paying back the loan of the other group member, if the other one is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nPhebe is married and has four school-age children. To make a living, Phebe owns and operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Phebe has been engaged in her business for over 5 years, and she earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Phebe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Phebe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. Phebe is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Phebe from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC: <br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":527400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Batoma C., who is often called Batoma Bakounkolo (goat head) because her restaurant features sheep and goat heads and feet, plans to use her loan to buy base products and ingredients for her restaurant. Each day she buys twelve heads of sheep and goats, 1 kg of onions, a basket of tomatoes and other small condiments. She restocks and then sells daily at the San market to a diverse customer base. Batoma expects to earn 56 000 XOF, while the other members of the group expect to earn 48 000 XOF per month.

Aminata dropped out of school in the 9th grade (Basic Malian educational system) to get married by parental will. She started her business after the death of her husband. She began by selling cakes; this business has given her the chance to gain business and marketing expertise. Later she started selling garlic and shallots and she has been now for 17 years in this business. She is well known in the area and enjoys a good reputation. In order to increase her capital and her revenue, 36 months ago she has joined Soro Yiriwaso and she received 2 group loans and 2 individual loans, all fully repaid. She is now receving her third individual loan, that she intends to use to buy a ton of shallots. She buys and sells in Burkina Faso in cash, wholesale and credit to a clientele of men and women. With this loan she plans to earn a monthly income of 120,000 CFA francs, that she will use for the family needs (buy food, clothing for children and payment of tuition fees). \r\nHer ambition is to

After several years of learning this business from an early age (parallel to her studies and her regular work), she has amassed solid experience. This is when she decided to launch a solo business selling clothing, shoes and food-grade ice, which she has been doing for two years. Her business is popular and she has a large customer base. Her strength is a large stock of ice.\r\n\r\nIn order to better satisfy customer demand and increase net profits, she has turned to Soro Yiriwaso.

They average 39 years of age and have an average of five children each. They all live in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali) and met through neighbours and marriage. This group of women trade in fodder (food for livestock), tomatoes, children's clothing and calabashes (vines which can be dried out to be used as bottles or utensils). With a view to increase their businesses, they decided to work together with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their fourth group loan. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mariam Traor\u00e9 who buys and sells decorative articles is planning to use her loan to buy 200 calabashes. She gets her supply of calabashes in Tona and Konodimini. The calabashes are peeled and engraved with small figures or designs made out materials which have been traditionally designed for this purpose. They are resold to order to newly married couples, sometimes on a door-to-door basis in the various neighborhoods, and the customer base is made up of women and men. Mrs. Mariam Traor\u00e9 hopes, along with the other members of the group, to make an average monthly profit of 27,500FCFA part of which will be invested in their businesses and part for their savings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":534908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase calabashes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dado       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e9t\u00e9    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779292,"comment":null},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961508,"comment":null},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699628,"comment":null},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913515,"comment":null},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180680,"comment":null},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476648,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-05T17:14:14Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198307,"name":"Chiara Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Chiara inicia su s\u00e9ptimo ciclo con 18 socias.

T. wants to start a business selling clothing.  All of these women are dedicated to their work and will use this loan to restock and expand their small businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group is called \u201cLas Orquideas\u201d (The Orchids) because they wanted a name that is identified with flowers because they consider themselves fragile, even though they are hardworking women.  Sra. Guadalupe F. C. is the group leader.  She is in a common law marriage and has three children:  Jair Vazquez F. (age 8), Jonathan Vazquez F. (age 15), and Cinthli Vazquez F. (age 17).  Her daughter helps with the business and is learning how to butcher the chickens.  The other children keep busy by helping to sell the chickens by the kilo.  Guadalupe has six years of experience in this business.  She has many customers and has the personality required to serve her customers well.  It is important to mention that Guadalupe is someone who is very conscious about the situation many Mexicans face during this time.  Therefore, she manages to sell her products at some of the best prices offered in the community.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group expresses their thanks for the trust and support placed in them by providing this opportunity.  This loan will be used to start or grow their businesses.

Her dream of having her own business came true when she received loans after joining ASHI.\r\n\r\nAt first, Lulu had a small \u201csari-sari\u201d store. Sari-sari means a store attached to a house where various kinds of foodstuff, beverages and other basic commodities are sold. A lot of people from the village are customers of this kind of store because this is the most convenient way they can access things they need every day without spending on transportation costs. Lulu and her family enjoyed the small proceeds her business brought them. \r\n\r\nEventually, through her successive loans from ASHI, Lulu was able to purchase a \u201cpedicab\u201d (a bicycle with sidecar) for a transportation business managed by her husband. Lulu and her husband have four children to support and so they both have to work hard and earn through their own business. Lulu\u2019s youngest child is two years old and the eldest is 26. Her oldest and her second oldest child, who is 24, are both working as computer programmers for small private shops in town. Both are not earning well, and so Lulu still supports some of their needs as well as the needs of her three other children. \r\n\r\nBecause Lulu\u2019s husband\u2019s pedicab is operated using a bicycle, he earns only a small income by the end of each day of hard work. Lulu is requesting a loan through ASHI to purchase a motorcycle to replace her husband\u2019s bicycle. With this, his income will grow and he will be able to support the improvement of their standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":668.25,"image":{"id":535096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20203050014) is a 27-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, N. operates a family member's business raising cattle for sale. N. has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, N. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  N. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  N. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. The loan will be the second loan taken out by N. from SEDA.  N. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

Ester\u2019s main challenge has been having a small stock due to the hindrances of small working capital to put into her fishing trade. As an active businesswoman, Ester has also been engaged in a sewing business for added income.\r\n\r\nShe joined ASHI, a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 1999 and is very grateful for secured access to capital and other services such as savings and insurance. This loan, amounting to 35,000 PHP, is to help Ester buy fishing nets, bamboo, rope and fingerlings to increase her stock to match her customers' demands in the local community. She thinks that commercializing her fishing business and expanding it will enable her to earn more revenue and be able to pay school fees for her children and cater to other family needs. With access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, Ester is hopeful her dreams of sending her children to a university to complete their college degrees will be achieved.

Maximina is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for the much larger amount of 20,000 PHP to purchase a new sewing machine and support the inventories of her store. This will allow her to grow their businesses further so that their children can fulfill their dreams of completing college degrees and finding good jobs. With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her activities will generate a steady income to improve her financial stability and give a better life to her family in a decent manner. Maximina\u2019s biggest dream is to have a successful tailoring business and to manage a full-fledged mini-grocery store someday. She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed while helping her family rise out of poverty. The financial opportunity of her two businesses is one of the best ways to help provide for her family and she very much wants to lift her family from under the umbrella of poverty.

the burden she is carrying on her shoulders being a single mother, 55-year-old Dominga D. C. remains strong and optimistic about reaching her dream for her two children. Being a mother, she cannot seem to ignore the feeling of guilt when she sees her children suffer from a shortage of food and other basic needs. When Dominga joined KIVA partner ASHI in 2006, the loan she requested was used to support her sewing business. She offers tailoring services particularly in the neighboring village. The profit from this business provides their cash flow and provides them with their basic needs. The income, however, is just too small to improve their standard of living. Thus, Dominga is now requesting a much larger loan to engage in a buy & sell business and to continue expanding her sewing business. With inventory for both businesses, she will gain more customers from around the village. Dominga is hoping that her envisioned businesses will help her to support the financial needs of her two children so that they are able to graduate from college. By then, she thinks their lives will be changed and she will have her dreams fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":535115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To expand her sewing business and start a buy & sell business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Talim Island, Binangonan Rizal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":124,"posted_date":"2010-05-04T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4800.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144643613,"comment":null},{"amount":72,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3200.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151825507,"comment":null},{"amount":72,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3200.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159565264,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4000.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166774046,"comment":null},{"amount":72,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3200.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172042752,"comment":null},{"amount":36,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1600.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177333170,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-04T15:15:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:08:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198369,"name":"Huong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Huong T.

To make a living, T. operates a family member's business raising cattle for sale.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by T. from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Evelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

With the loan, she will purchase raw materials including fishnets and an additional supply of fish for sale.  With additional equipment, she believes their fish inventory will increase, thus generating higher income and profits from the business. With the support of ASHI and Kiva lenders, Eufemia is positive that the family business will continue to flourish, deliver stable profits, and support improvements in her family\u2019s quality of life out of poverty. Eufemia also dreams that her children go to school until college and that they find stable jobs. One of her aspirations is to be able to build her own house that is durable and spacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":535136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

Jocelyn V. is a mother focused on her family\u2019s dream. She lives in the coastal place of Talim Island, Binangonan, Rizal, Philippines with her loving husband, Wilfredo (a fisherman) and five children. The couple works hard to give a better education to their children for the future and they want a better life as well. They decided to join ASHI in 2006 to get capital for their business, which is a fishing and fish trading business. They have requested a new loan of Php 17,000.00. They will invest this capital to maintain raw materials needed in the fishing business and to purchase additional inventories of fish for sale. They hope to build their own beautiful house, expanding their fishing business and have wider space for their fishing equipment. The family feels very happy with the loan that will improve their lives. She is continuing to pray and wish all lenders all the best and good luck, and that they will continue to support poor families like hers who want to improve their standards of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":535144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

For the past 15 years, she has lived in a 2-room house.\r\n\r\nShe has completed her education to 10th standard, but could not study further due to the limited financial resources of her family.\r\n\r\nShe got married at the age of 18. After marriage she started sewing clothes to financially support her husband. He works in Saudi Arabia, so he lives far away from his family. Now she makes embroidered dresses as well, and earns a good income. She utilizes her income for the education of her children and also saves the additional profit.\r\n\r\nShe works not only to generate income for her family, but also because she loves her work. Her work gives her satisfaction because it enables her to meet the desires of her children and it encourages her husband. \r\n\r\nSajida is also a very sensible mother. She has four children: one son and three daughters. All of her children are studying because she wants them to have a good future.\r\n\r\nShe has a brother who lives with her and is involved in making handbags. Sajida wants to help him because he is a very hard worker. She is applying for a loan for the first time from Asasah (a microfinance institute in Pakistan and a partner of Kiva) to invest in her brother's business so that he may purchase required items for the handbags (leather, cloth, zippers). Helping him increase his income makes Sajida proud.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":535209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling dried fish in the market. Marites has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marites is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Marites from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is a widow; without her husband, it has been very difficult for her to live but she has never given up and keeps involving herself in a small business selling garments.\r\n\r\nShe has an obedient 16-year-old daughter who is the only source of her motivation. She focuses on giving her a good career and for this reason, she works hard to generate income. \r\n\r\nShe not only sells garments but also provides the facility of sewing to her clients. From these two businesses, she earns approximately Pak Rs. 10,000 which allows her to manage the education expenses of her daughter and to run the financial circle.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan for the first time from Asasah (a microfinance institute in Pakistan and a partner of Kiva) to purchase an electric sewing machine which will help her to sew more clothes because the manual machine takes her double the time and makes her tired quickly.\r\n\r\nShe has a dream to give her daughter the chance to gain higher education and to see her become a teacher of a renowned college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":535214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase an

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is \u00d4 C\u00e1ch nh\u00f3m 02 (2).\r\n\r\n\r\nU. is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, U. owns and operates a business venture in the manufacturing sector, operating a furniture making business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.  U. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, U. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  U. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.944.000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  U. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb H.

She is 44 years old. Imelda is the group leader of a ten-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Imelda M. group.\r\n\r\nImelda is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $45 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Brigida B. is from the village of Barangay Ibung, VillaverD., Nueva Vizcaya. She is 60 years old. Brigida is the group leader of an 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nBrigida is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Brigida owns & operates a general store, selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Brigida has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 8500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Brigida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Brigida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Brigida is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the product offering. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Brigida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

They will each use the loan for different purposes so that it can improve their businesses in the future. \r\n\r\nMr. Moeun M. is the group leader who has been selected by all the members. He is a construction worker and aside from this, he sells beds in his local village also. Since his business is going well, he wants to expand it.

Chu Th\u1ecb (20213030009) is a 33-year-old woman living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong in B\u1eafc Ninh Province. She is married and has three school-age children. To making a living, T. owns and operates a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes from selling dried goods in the local community. T. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years, and she earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. T. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by T. from SEDA. T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SEDA: <br>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nT.

She wants to increase the inventory of her store for the convenience of her customers who live around the village. \r\n\r\nNarcisa happily handles her career being a wife, mother, and businesswoman. Her desire to give her children a better life in the future inspired her to have her own businesses and augment her husband\u2019s sporadic income as a government employee. \r\n\r\nNarcisa is a very good member of ASHI who is requesting a new loan of 45,000 Php to realize her dream of buying more vegetables & fruits, pigs to be slaughtered, and to purchase inventory for her store. The pigs that Narcisa slaughters are sold directly to people in different municipalities during market day. Profit from this kind of businesses is quite good compared to other businesses that Narcisa has tried. Furthermore, she wishes to support the education of all her children until they graduate from college and have a better career in the future. With her passion for giving her children a better future, she will be willing to work hard and help her husband earn money through her businesses. \r\n\r\nNarcisa is motivated by her desire for personal development so that one day she can be self-reliant in her businesses.

Ainsi, ces candidats participent au leul pour \u00eatre forg\u00e9s et non pour se faire plaisir ou faire \u00e9tat de leurs diff\u00e9rences sociales. \nSelon les organisateurs, les premiers jours, la plupart des enfants ont du mal \u00e0 se d\u00e9partir de leurs habitudes, mais \u00e0 force de recevoir les enseignements de l'encadrement, ils finissent par se ranger.\n\nLa plus populaire de ces c\u00e9r\u00e9monies est organis\u00e9e par intervalle d'ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9cise au sud du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal en Casamance par les diolas. Cette ann\u00e9e, elle va se f\u00e9ter au mois de Juillet prochain. \nAvec ce pr\u00eat Madame Emilie S., une diola originaire de Casamance,  compte cotiser pour son jeune fr\u00e8re et respecter une tradition.    ","en":"Ms. Emilie S., aged 31, has been a nurse by profession for almost ten years.\u00a0 Married and the mother of a 6-month-old child, she is requesting a loan at the U-IMCEC Thi\u00e8s branch office to conform to a custom.\u00a0 That is, her younger brother must enter <i>la case des hommes<\/i> (the men's hut).\u00a0 Customs dictate that a boy's older brother or sister is responsible for paying the costs.\u00a0 This ceremony is called <i>leul<\/i>, or communal circumcision, and has the purpose of reviving an important aspect of culture.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor some people, <i>leul<\/i> is considered to be\u00a0schooling in life.\u00a0 It initiates the candidates in the rites of life.\u00a0 Thus, the candidates participate in\u00a0<i>leul<\/i> to be recast and molded, not to have fun or to justify their societal differences. \u00a0 \r\n\r\nAccording to the organizers, in the first few days, most of the children have trouble divesting themselves of their ways.\u00a0 But by dint of the supervised learning, they end up falling in line.\r\n\r\nIn southern Senegal, in Casamance, the most widespread of these ceremonies is organized by the <i>Diola<\/i> ethnic group for a precise time in the year.\u00a0 This year, the ceremony is going to be celebrated this July.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Emilie S., a Diola with roots in Casamance, plans on making the payments for her younger
