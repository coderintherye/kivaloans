When he realized one day that his job was very poorly paid, he decided to become independent and launch his own business. In the beginning he distributed the goods on a motorcycle, then a few loans helped him to buy a car and he could serve more customers because he could transport a larger quantity of goods.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Juan Carlos runs his business with a very good customer base and because of this his income has increased considerably. Often he has so many customers that he can't serve them all, because his inventory is not sufficient for all his customers. This is why Juan Carlos hopes that a loan will give him the opportunity to buy more bakery goods and pastries in order to have more goods to sell to more customers and thus he would continue to earn money for his household expenses.\r\n\r\nJuan Carlos dreams that his business may give him a good profit. Later on, he might launch a great selling company and offer his products in several cities and create jobs.

Pero como ella es una mujer responsable y aprovecha cada oportunidad para obtener ingresos, comenz\u00f3 hace poco a criar vacas, cerdos y pavos; los cuales cuida con dedicaci\u00f3n, para venderlos por kilos a los carniceros que la visitan constantemente. Ahora planea ahorrar dinero para comprar sus propios terrenos agr\u00edcolas. Ella pertenece al grupo solidario \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d y este es el cuarto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por tanto espera de un peque\u00f1o pr\u00e9stamo para que pueda cumplir con sus objetivos. Por otro lado promete cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anterior cr\u00e9dito que tuvo. Adem\u00e1s le agrada ser parte de su asociaci\u00f3n porque  todos sus integrantes son personas responsables y solidarias. Beatriz de recibir su apoyo; invertir\u00e1 el dinero solicitado en la compra de productos de primera necesidad para su tienda de comestibles. \n\n","en":"Beatriz is 23 years old and a brave single mother. She lives with her two children, Michael and Adeliz. She cares for them in her aunt's house, located in a town next to Yanamarca. She gets up early every day to attend the to the residents of her town, who constantly visit her to buy food. She already has 3 years experience selling basic necessity products. At the same time, thanks to help from her children, she plants potatoes, beans and quinoa on rented land, as she doesn't have her own. It is going very well for her and after every harvest she sells her products at the city market. But since she is a responsible woman who takes advantage of every opportunity to make income, a short while ago she started to raise cows, pigs and turkeys. She takes very good care of them in order to sell them by the kilo to the butchers who constantly visit. Now she plans on saving money to buy her own crop land. She belongs to the \"Virgen Maria\" solidarity group and this is her fourth loan with MFP. She hopes for a small loan to meet her goals. She promises to make her payments on time as she did in the previous loan. She likes being a part of her association because all of he members are responsible and supportive. If Beatriz receives your support, she will invest the money she has asked for in  buying basic necessity products for her food store.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":59.22,"image":{"id":996273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy products to stock her store.

She lives in the company of her husband, Jesus, who she married 25 years ago. They have three children but only Cesar, the youngest, lives with them in their own house located in the town of San Lorenzo. A year ago, their daughter died due to an illness. In order to care for her, they had to sell their guinea pigs. They feel sad upon recalling this. Now they have only 38 examples but they are working to expand and for this they want to build more places where they will live. They do not only raise guinea pigs but also cattle, bulls and hens of good quality. From this they obtain earnings from selling milk and animals. Additionally, her husband works in the city government where they pay him a monthly salary. On the weekends, the two of them are dedicated to planting maize and alfalfa in their own farm land. Alfalfa helps with feeding their children but the maize is sold in the same farm since it is very good quality and they already have fixed buyers. Now they wish to improve the infrastructure of their house. She belongs to the group \"San Lorenzo\" and this is the tenth loan with MFP so she hopes that a small loan can achieve her objectives. At the same time she promises to make her payments on time as she did with her previous loan. Additionally she is thankful to be part of her association because all of the members are responsible and united people. Maria, upon receiving your support, will invest the requested money in the purchase of more guinea pigs and build more pens in which they can live."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":996290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more guinea pigs and build pens for them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-04T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-05T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-04T22:12:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387735,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema is 38 years old and is married with two children who are 16 and 19 years old.

However, because of his dedication and desire to get ahead in life, he has been able to overcome these difficulties and make progress with his family.  For most of his life, he has worked in granaries, and in wholesale and retail stores.  With the experience that he acquired over almost 20 years, he decided to establish his own general store where he offers basic consumer goods for sale.

He also wants to buy a greater variety of products to offer them.  However, Jose Nicolas does not have enough capital to make all of these purchases, and so it is for this reason that he is hoping to get a loan.  This loan will provide him with the opportunity to buy a glass display case and shelving where he could exhibit the products that he offers to his customers.\r\n\r\nJose Nicolas hopes that in this way, his sales will increase a lot, as he will have more to offer to his customers.  In addition, he hopes that he will increase his earnings, and so will be able to provide his wife and his 3 children with a better quality of life and more opportunities to get ahead in

is 46 years old and lives in the town of Mityana in the Mubende region of Uganda. She is widowed and has three children; one of them is currently in school. For the past 10 years, Betty has been working hard to manage her stationary shop, which sells books and has a photocopy machine. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Betty has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

She is separated from the father of her children, and she lives with her children in her own house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda sells soft drinks.  To do so she has a refrigerator that she bought with her savings.  That is where she stores her drinks and keeps them cold.  Her business is in her own house, where her customers come looking for a cool drink.\r\n\r\nShe started her business a year ago with a loan from MFP.  So far she takes care of the business herself.  She likes her business because it allows her to be at home and take care of her young children, whom she loves very much.  Also, the income the business generates for her is to pay for the household expenses.  On the other hand, what she does not like is when it rains often; it makes it difficult to sell her product.  She depends upon a warm climate in order to sell.  She now has plans to increase the variety of her products with energy drinks and yogurt.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP.

Al ver que su negocio era muy mal pago decidi\u00f3 independizarse y desde entonces tiene su propio taller de estampaci\u00f3n y gracias a este genera los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar.

Quite a while ago the mother of his two children abandoned the family, and since then he has had to find a way to move forward with his children. \r\n\r\nGabriel was previously employed in a business where they did t-shirt printing, and thanks to that he learned how to do this. His job was not well paying so he decided to go out on his own and since then he has had his own printing shop. It is thanks to this that he is able to generate the necessary income to support his household. In his shop Gabriel is well known for offering high quality products, which has resulted in his sales increasing more and more with the passing of time. \r\n\r\nGabriel doesn't have the capacity for large production because he doesn't have a lot of work tools. Sometimes his workload is too high and he has to work late into the night, which wears him out and sometimes causes him to get sick. With the desire to improve this situation, Gabriel wants to buy some work tools which will allow him to be more efficient and take less time, and also be able to offer service to customers who place large orders.

They have two grown sons. Irina has run her own business for nine years. She grows early vegetables. Irina decided to go into this business because it's very prospective  for her region. Right now, she has four large greenhouses and a \"nursery\" greenhouse, for seedlings. \r\nIrina is very responsible and hardworking with a desire to expand her business.

She hopes that in the future she will be able to start up a mini-supermarket. \r\n\r\nBirabwa is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Birabwa who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":74.84,"image":{"id":998496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more essential commodities like sugar for resale,","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Nakifuma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.543611 32.79","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Birabwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":170102},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":176246},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":182612},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":189208},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":196042},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":203123},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":210459},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":218061},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":225937},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":234098},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":242553},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":251559}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.84,"local_amount":170102,"processed_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":172517.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264133276,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T12:37:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388080,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 31 years old and married with three children.

She is well known, appreciated and admired by her neighbors because she works hard at all times and all places. Despite her age she asks God to grant her many years of life to allow her to keep on helping the women of her neighborhood, so that they can be pillars of hard work for their partners and offer the best possible to their children. Faustina got several requests for firewood and she wants to distribute it in her neighborhood, but she lacks the necessary capital and is forced to apply for a loan to buy firewood.\r\n\r\nHer fellow group member is Se\u00f1ora Ingrid Yolanda, aged 35, who sells general medicine  in her neighborhood with her husband and their three children.

She says that people ask for a lot of medicine and often have prescriptions, but she doesn't keep everything in stock because medicine is expensive and she doesn't have enough money to stock up. She wholeheartedly asks for support by way of a loan, so that she can meet the needs of her customers by having the requested medicine available.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":88.38,"image":{"id":990756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy firewood for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T13:30:03Z","loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.38,"local_amount":673.35,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":687.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263297499,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T14:33:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384379,"name":"Duo Los Apocentos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Duo los Apocentos.

She used to work in a restaurant but gradually became independent and began selling her own food to customers.  Cruz Elena is married and has two children for whom she has always wanted to provide the best she could.  Since her husband's salary is not enough to cover household expenses, Cruz Elena decided to set up her own business making blood pudding, tamales, chicken pies and other products which she sells to family, friends and neighbors.  She is able to generate enough income to contribute to household maintenance.\r\n\r\nCurrently Cruz Elena must make improvements in her kitchen since the health authorities made suggestions as to what she should do to upgrade her work site.  Since she sells her goods on a credit basis, and customers often get behind in their payments, Cruz Elena does not have much capital right now.

She lives with her common-law husband, Francisco who is a state employee.  They have three children, ages 16, 9 and 2 and they live in their own house which they bought through much effort.  Melita sells essential groceries which she transports along the Ucayali River to sell to different rural communities.  Sometimes she sells on credit, but most transactions are done in cash.  In the four years she has been in business she has attracted many customers.  Her husband also helps her in his free time.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it gives her extra income to take care of expenses.  Also, she gets to know other places and new people, while observing how her business grows through hard work.  What she does not like so much is having to be away from home and not being able to care for the children, but she knows that what she is doing is in their interest.  Through her efforts she is trying to give them a better lifestyle, doing all she can to grow her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan through the MFP institution.  She is counting on your help so she can meet her goals.  She is very comfortable with her communal bank because it is a united group and she has found support from everyone.

Fekrieh is photographed in a FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs.

Elba has been working for approximately 14 years since she moved from her home town to the city of Medell\u00edn to seek out better opportunities.  She started a fast-food business outside her house and thanks to it was able to generate enough income to cover her expenses.  Afterwards, due to family difficulties, she had to support her younger sister who moved in with her.  She decided to set up a general store to sell essential food items and other products, which allowed her to make a better income and giver her sister a better quality of life.

As\u00ed fue como en el a\u00f1o 1971, trabaj\u00f3 en una empresa de confecciones durante un periodo de dos a\u00f1os,  y posteriormente aprendi\u00f3 otros proceso en diversas empresas confeccionistas, donde aprendi\u00f3 a operar maquinas industriales, trabaj\u00f3 en mejoramiento final de la prenda, y en todas las operaciones de la confecci\u00f3n durante un periodo de 15 a\u00f1os, hasta que desde hace 4  se dedic\u00f3 a su propio negocio en compa\u00f1\u00eda de una amiga, que posee   un taller en su casa, pero algunas  de las tareas las hace en su vivienda donde cuenta con una m\u00e1quina familiar, con la que simult\u00e1neamente atiende las necesidades de sus clientes en un n\u00famero no menor de 40.

El sistema de venta de Dunia es contra entrega, en algunas ocasiones le dan un anticipo del 50% de la prenda, con el que inicia su trabajo. Sus prendas de vestir son muy bien elaboradas y esto la lleva a ser muy reconocida y a tener siempre clientes. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 una maquina fileteadora, con ella planea optimizar sus tiempos y mejorara su acabado.  Con este  cr\u00e9dito resolver\u00e1 una de sus necesidades apremiantes, pues para filetear debe acudir a talleres amigos que le prestan el servicio.  Su meta mas adelante es tener un taller bien dotado de una infraestructura que le permita concentrar todas las tareas productivas y generar empleos a otras confeccionistas. ","en":"Dunia, 55, is a married woman with three children, aged 25 to 36. She is a seamstress who makes all types of clothing for women, men and children. \r\n\r\nShe obtained her knowledge when she was 14 years old, when her sister stopped providing formal studies, and she decided to learn a skill that would enable her to get ahead. Thus it was that in 1971 she worked in a tailoring business for two years and later learned other procedures in a variety of tailoring businesses: she learned to operate industrial machines, she worked finishing articles and in all stages of tailoring for 15 years. Then 4 years ago she started her own business together with a friend who has a workshop in her house. However, she also does some work at her own home where she has a family sewing machine and meets the needs of her private customers who number no less than 40.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a great help since he works for an optical company and both of them contribute to the wellbeing of the family.\r\n\r\nDunia receives payment on delivery; sometimes they give her an advance payment of 50%, with which she begins the work Her garments are very well made and this has garnered wide recognition and attracted customers.\r\n\r\nCurrently Dunia is applying for a loan, her first funding from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy a serging machine which will enable her to optimize her time and improve her finishing. With this loan she will resolve one of her pressing needs, since to overcast seams she now has to go to the workshops of friends who let her use their machines. Her future goal is to have a well-equipped workshop with a good infrastructure that will enable her to concentrate all stages of production and generate jobs for other seamstresses. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":996492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a serging machine which will optimize her time and improve the finishing on her garments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dunia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":69284},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74789},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76534},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78320},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80148},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82018},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83932},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85890},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87894},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89945},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92044},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99202}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T18:52:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387781,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is 43 years old and married with two children.

In the past he was the victim of a kidnapping, but was able to escape. Later on, his children were also kidnapped, and after he paid for them to be freed, they were killed. Since then, Alejandro has suffered economic hardship that has been difficult to surmount. However, thanks to his great commitment to his work, he and his wife have been able to get ahead. \r\n\r\nAround 20 years ago Alejandro learned to make handicrafts out of foam rubber, wood and fabric, among other things, and thanks to this he has generated enough income to make a living. Alejandro has seen his sales increase considerably. A large part of this is due to the good service that he offers. For this reason he currently has a large number of orders that he cannot fulfil, given that he makes everything by hand. In order to improve this situation, Alejandro hopes to purchase a sewing machine; however, he doesn\u2019t have sufficient capital to do so. This is why he is hoping that a loan will provide him with the opportunity to buy a sewing machine, which will allow him to speed up the production process.\r\n\r\nAlejandro hopes that he will then be able to serve customers whom he has had to turn away in the past and thus increase his income. Alejandro\u2019s dream is to have a business that allows him to make a large profit and generate jobs.

They live in different parts of the city of Cuenca that is known as Saint Anne of the four rivers. Since December 1999, it is a Cultural Heritage Site. It is a city rich in culture and traditions. Its gastronomic variety captures the palate of natives and foreigners. Its people are friendly, kind and very charismatic, like our members, who are fighting, entrepreneurial women that look, in their daily work, for the best opportunities that will get their families ahead.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Martha. She is 27 years old and a single mother of three children who are 12, 10 and 7 years old. All her children study in the city school. They do not have their own house, so they rent.\r\n\r\nMartha works in the market selling potatoes, for which they pay her a monthly salary. She has been working in this job for 15 years. She works from Sunday to Sunday from 7 in the morning until 7 at night.\r\n\r\nIn the communal bank, she is in her second loan cycle and will invest her loan in her children\u2019s schooling expenses.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have her own business selling potatoes, since she knows the business already.\r\n\r\nThe small photo attached is of a member who, for health reasons, was not able to be present when the group photo was taken. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":541.67,"image":{"id":996578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to buy school supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":3250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noemi Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Johanna Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Transito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3245,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":270.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":270.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":540.84,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":541.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263319288,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T14:20:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388445,"name":"Otgonbaatar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Otgonbaatar, 31, runs a freight transportation business.

A long time ago he began working as a laborer (loading and unloading trucks) in his town, and thanks to this work he met a friend who grows potatoes. The friend offered him the opportunity to sell potatoes, so that he could commercialize them in his town, and because of this, it has been two years since Rodrigo combined his work as a laborer with the sale of potatoes. Rodrigo sells his product in his town to the principal stores in the sector, and this has permitted him to meet a large number of customers who give him big orders. Because he now has a large order from one customer that he is unable to satisfy with the inventory that he now has, Rodrigo must buy the potatoes to be able to fill this order. Nevertheless, Rodrigo does not have sufficient capital to make this purchase, so he hopes that a loan will offer him the opportunity to make the purchase of large quantities of potatoes to be able to fill the order that one customer has placed with him.\r\n\r\nRodrigo hopes to be able to continue selling this product and in the future to be able to diversify the products that he offers. It is for this reason that he works hard every day and has saved little by little with the intention of setting up a large marketing operation for vegetables and fruits.

For this reason she came to credikiva, her first loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will buy school supplies, clothing, sandals and other products, taking advantage of the season in which the students have spending money, which is a great season for sales and her income will increase.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJulieta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulieta hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Emma earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells personal products for additional income. Emma's store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Emma is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmma hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":45,"image":{"id":999219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1924.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275496,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T13:05:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388522,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia is 52 years old and lives in D'Ban, Calamba.

Carlos Mario ahora tiene unos peque\u00f1os ahorros y espera comprar unas vitrinas para exhibir sus productos en su tienda. Sin embargo, no cuenta con el dinero suficiente para poder comprar las vitrinas y comprar la mercanc\u00eda para surtir su negocio, por lo que espera que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una vitrina para exhibir sus productos y a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar para surtir esta vitrina.\n\nCarlos Mario espera que de esta manera sus ventas aumenten considerablemente, pues su negocio estar\u00e1 mejor presentado para sus clientes, quienes podr\u00e1n encontrar mayor variedad de productos en su tienda. Carlos Mario sue\u00f1a con que sus padres puedan disfrutar de una mejor calidad de vida, y espera que con unos buenos ingresos de su tienda el se los pueda ofrecer.

Since then he started a general store, in which he only sold vegetables at the beginning.  Because Carlos Mario knew how to manage his money, he saved most of the income and re-invested it in the business and now he also sells basic groceries.  Carlos Mario now has small savings and hopes to buy display cabinets to show his products at the store.  However, he doesn't have enough money to buy them and also buy merchandise to stock the store, so he hopes a loan gives him the access to a display cabinet and to buy basic groceries to stock it.  Carlos Mario hopes that this way his sales will increase considerably, because the store will be more presentable to his clients, who will be able to find a larger variety of products.  Carlos Mario dreams to see his parents enjoy a better quality of life and hopes that with the good income form the store he can offer this to them.

He has worked raising chickens for ten years.  He began helping a neighbor who was doing this work.  Then his neighbor gave him 50 chickens on credit so he could fatten them and sell them by the pound.  Later he got together with his mother and they bought more than 100 chickens, quartered them, and sold them.\r\n\r\nCurrently Wilian is raising chickens every six weeks, which are the days of production.  He sells 500 pounds already delivered.  He has his customers, among whom he supplies a hotel and stores in various communities.  He buys 110 chickens in a city that is 56 miles from where he lives, and manages to get 100 five-pound chickens.  To buy the chickens he has to leave the house at 6:00 a.m., walk three-and-a-half kilometers, and board a vehicle that drives him to the city where he buys the chickens.  He buys them once a week along with the feed to feed them.  During farming season Wilian works growing basic grains to sell and also works as the assistant of a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nWilian is requesting the loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy 125 more chickens and feed to feed those he already has and those he will buy, because the demand is growing.  Once they reach their weight he quarters them, cleans them, and sells them by the pound.  He also will expand the farm for at least 50 more chickens.  In this way he will receive greater income, because he will supply all his customers and meet the demand.  With this income he will give his family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHe plans to work very hard raising the chickens and work only on this, since this is the work from which he gets the most income.

One is 10 years old and about to start fifth grade; a 7-year-old daughter will start first grade. The smallest of his children is 7 months old. They live in the house his mother-in-law left them. Juan's wife has a small business in their home selling enchiladas and enredos (snack food made from fried yuca).\r\n\r\nJuan is a farmer, but at the present time he is working in construction. He says that he farms because he has always liked it. But he realized that he earned more income, more quickly, doing construction. \r\n\r\nSo he started to learn from the age of 12. His father taught him this trade. Now 32, he says he likes the construction trade better, and in this way he can work with his siblings and his father. In the beginning, he did every job with his father's help, as he was the one who had the tools. \r\n\r\nAs time went on, Juan saved money and started buying his materials, tools, and work equipment. That's why he no longer depends so much on his father, and does jobs independently. But he says it is always better to work as a family. \r\n\r\nHe is applying to Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan, in order to pay off a debt that he has, and so that his elder children can start classes without any problem. He plans to continue working energetically for his family. He says that every responsible father is obliged to work for his children. In addition, someday he wants his eldest son to learn his father's trade, just as he learned it from his."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":997257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To pay off a debt he has, and so that his two older children can start their classes without any problem.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T06:00:03Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":740,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":46.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":47.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":51.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":61.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-06T17:14:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
