Now he plans on expanding his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432

She is married and has three children and lives in the Kibera slums. Monica also takes care of her nephew from Meru since the harsh conditions back in the rural part of the country he is from do not allow him to get a stable job.\r\n\r\nMonica\u2019s motivation to involve herself in the business of spinning wool was influenced by her mother who was an expert in that trade. Monica then decided to learn more and went through two months of training from her neighbor whom her mother had employed. Her mother could not train her since she was always busy delivering orders from clients. \r\n\r\nHaving been equipped with the necessary skills, Monica decided to start her own business in the year 1993. This was after she got married and the business helped in sustaining her family since at this time, she was living with her mother-in \u2013law, who also helped her to buy a spinning machine for her business. She struggled to bring up her business until she was able to save Ksh 3,000.00 (USD 45) with which she added an electric machine to her business, to help with the spinning, since it could do the work faster. G. goes to Nakuru once every month, and buys wool weighing 150-200kgs. She has so far been able to employ three workers who help in combing the wool after which Monica spins it into thread ready for sale. She sells the thread in different areas because she has customers as far as Ongata Rongai, Kikuyu and Limuru (regions within the country). She usually combs about 7kgs of wool per week. Her mother-in-law is now very grateful because Monica is able to supporting her.\r\n\r\nMonica is requesting for a loan of USD 325 to enable her to purchase a large stock of wool. The loan will help raise the capital for her business hence the business will expand. This will in the long run raise her family income thus will be able to meet all the family needs.

This will result in better services for her clients whom she believe are going to increase in number. Her ultimate intention is to open a school where she can create employment becahse the EPZ, an exporting company that offered employment on a casual basis, has closed down and many young people who were employed there now have   nowhere to go.

She lives in Kariobangi South, an area characterized by informal settlements located within the Eastern part of Nairobi. Here, she sells vegetables and cereals to help provide for her family. She is a born-again Christian and a very committed member of her local church located within her neighborhood. She is the chairlady of the women\u2019 fellowship in her local church where, besides giving spiritual nourishment, they empower women in the church economically. Her husband is involved in casual jobs from which he gets little wages. \r\n\r\nIn order to supplement the family income, Tabitha started her business by selling vegetables in small quantities way back in 1997. Previously, she would knit cardigans and sell them at Ksh 500 and this is how she was able to make savings to start off her vegetable and cereal business. With time, she made considerable progress and moved from selling the vegetables from the ground where she arranged them, to constructing a kiosk, from where she now sells her products. Apart from the vegetables that she sold, Tabitha also introduced a range of cereals. However, due to the limited capital she has, she only manages to buy in measures of quarter sacks, and these only last for about two days, after which she has to buy additional stock. \r\n\r\nTabitha now wants to take her business a notch higher and therefore wants to purchase the cereals in full sacks. This will increase her profit and will enable her to retain her customers who sometimes come to buy cereals but  find them out of stock. She is requesting for a loan of USD 400, which will be given in kind, to purchase the stock of cereals, including beans, peas and rice. The loan repayment period will be 12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":76446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchased

She takes care of her nephew aged 20 who is attending the Kenya Polytechnic, a technical college located in the town centre of Nairobi, and her ageing mother who stays in their rural home in Central part of Kenya. Catherine lives in Kitengela Township.\r\n\r\nCatherine started her business in the year 2000.This was after her elder brother loaned her Ksh. 20,000 (USD 295). She used part of the money to rent a small room for Ksh 300 (USD 4) per month. The business grew very well and she managed even to educate her younger brother and sister up to college level. As the business grew, she landed a contract in the year 2004 to run the police canteen at a place known as Kamukunji, where she has been operating to date.\r\n\r\nThe business has been very good and Catherine now wants to increase her stock for the business. She has approached three of the leading Micro finance banks in Kenya but she found that the interest rate they charge is too high; hence she felt that she couldn\u2019t afford the loans. Catherine therefore thought it wise to come and try her luck with KIVA, hence she approached ANK for support. She is kindly requesting for a loan of USD 1200 to enable her to purchase an assortment of stock for her retail shop which serves the police within the Kamukunji Police Station. Some of the items she intends to purchase include:  Sugar, cleaning detergents, cereals like maize, rice and beans. She also wants to buy maize flour, wheat flour, and cooking fat. Apart from the foodstuff, she would also like to introduce a range of cosmetics, which her customers have been asking for. She is confident that the additional stock will enable her to provide her clients with a wide range of assorted goods, which will be a welcome move. This will in turn translate into more income for her family. She intends to repay the loan over a period of 12 Months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":76448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase stock for a general shop  including - Sugar, cleaning detergents, cereals and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitengela, Athi River","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-10-19T18:25:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-03T00:36:53Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:22:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97896,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116399,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136247,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158970,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183733,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211308,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239465,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268435,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5278918,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-20T00:36:53Z","paid_date":"2008-12-15T18:04:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":21756,"name":"Natasha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natasha is a hard-working young entrepreneur from Mukachevo, Ukraine.

She grew up with her parents and siblings, and like most rural families they were quite poor. Thus she was forced to spend her free time helping her mother with the housework and farming. She later married and needed to start a small business out of her backyard in order to help her husband cover some of the household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, besides selling food products, she performs agriculture work, depending on the season and frequency of rain. She has been in business for over 17 years now, without formal training and operating on her own - in her absence, her children take on the responsibility. With the loan of 10,000 meticais she plans to buy rice, sugar, corn starch, oil and other products. Since she operates out of her backyard, she is easily able to open at 7:30 a.m. and close at 6:30 p.m. She purchases products in Maputo and uses public transportation. The winter season and weekends are the best in terms of profitability. Her average daily revenue is 1,200 MT, sugar being the most lucrative product. \r\n<p>\r\nThe greatest difficulties she faces are the fluctuations in the prices of products and transporting them from the place of purchase to her home. The business is doing well, with a profit margin of 2,000 MT, allowing her to support the family and improve her home. In the future, she aspires to build a grocery store with conventional materials and diversify her product range. She will need a loan in order to move forward with the project.

She is 27 years old, she has finished 7th grade and she lives with and supports 5 people.  She is married.  She used to live with her parents and siblings and go to school.  In her free time she helped her mother with fishing work.  The family did without basic necessities due to lack of fishing nets which were constantly destroyed.  So she pursued a new source of income selling food from her home.  \r\n\r\n<p>She began fishing 10 years ago, without any formal training.  She employs 2 people, one of whom has children.  She intends to buy nets with the loan of 13,000 MT [meticals, the currency of Mozambique].  Her workday begins very early in the morning, depending on the tide, around 3 am and ends at 6pm.  She buys nets and equipment in Maputo and brings them home on public transport.  Winter is the most productive season with the best catches, and the product doesn't deteriorate as quickly.  Her average daily sale is 1,000 MT, with shrimp being the most lucrative catch.  \r\n\r\n<p> Her biggest challenge is the systematic destruction of nets due to ships and boats, which means the nets don't last as long as one would hope and which affect the size catch and the cost of materials.  With her profits, she pays salaries, supports her family and continues with the construction of her home.  In the future, she hopes to build a boat, but it will depend on her productivity, as it will only begin after she pays back this loan first.  She is happy with her work flow, which has improved since she was able to buy more nets with the last loan.  \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated by Bianca Vargas, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jossefa

Later, he was influenced by some photographers that he met at that time and decided to become a photographer.  But he didn't have a camera nor money to buy one, so at age 19 he went to South Africa with the idea of getting a job there to save money for a camera.  But he couldn't find work there, so he began working again as a walking merchant in South Africa.  After 2 years, he was able to buy a camera and returned to Mozambique where he continued as a merchant while learning how to use his camera.  Eighteen months later, he began work as a photographer, and at age 23, married his wife, with whom he has a 2 year old son.

She is married and attended school until the 4th grade. She supports five people and lives with 4. She lived the greater part of her childhood with her mother and attended school at the Chiango Educational Center. In her free time, she would help her mother chop wood for resale. In 1990, she married and moved to the Costa do Sol neighborhood, later migrating to Filipe, Matutuine district. Together with her husband she entered the retail business and also performed some agricultural work. Due to difficulties with her children\u2019s schooling, she decided to move to Catembe where she currently lives. \r\n<p>\r\nShe operates her retail business from her backyard and has been active for 20 years. Her husband is trained in business administration. They have no employees as they are able to run the business themselves without assistance. With the current loan of 20,000 MT she plans to purchase rice, sugar and corn starch in 50 and 25 kg bags, respectively, as well as other grocery products. The store's opening hours are from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. She purchases goods in Maputo and rents a car to transport them. The business does not enjoy any peak periods; however, during weekends demand is higher. Her daily revenue is 3,000 MT. The most lucrative products are rice, sugar and oil. She keeps a log where she records receipts and sales as well existing stock. Her main constraint is the lack of transportation and conventional installations. \r\n<p>\r\nHer monthly profit margin is 12,000 MT, which she uses to support the family, improve the shop and put her kids through school. In the future, she plans to build a conventional store, own a form of transportation and if possible set up a hardware store. This may require an additional loan once the current one has been repaid. The client is very happy with the loan as it has helped her increase her sales volume and diversify her product range.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Leo Duran, Kiva

Because of his father\u2019s good will, John was able to stock his shop with goods and also purchase a scale, which is handy in any shop for weighing of items like sugar and cereals.\r\n\r\n<p>The business has continued to grow over the last two years and the number of customers has increased as well -- so has the demand for new products like fresh meat, vegetables and dairy products. John has to meet his customers\u2019 demands if he is to remain in business. He has therefore decided to start stocking these items, which are in very high demand in his area. The only impediment to this is a lack of coolers, which he will need in order to keep the products fresh. John is therefore requesting a loan of USD 1200, which will enable him to purchase the two coolers that he needs to expand his business and satisfy his customers' needs. The repayment period for this loan will be 10 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":76478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase two coolers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Embakasi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.3 36.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-10-23T20:35:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-07T12:09:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:22:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97897,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116400,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136248,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158971,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183734,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211309,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239466,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268436,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":297616,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328212,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-24T11:09:26Z","paid_date":"2008-09-17T07:04:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":21783,"name":"Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hassan is married with 5 children.

He is married and attended school until the 2nd grade. He grew up in a family environment with his parents and siblings, going to school and taking care of the animals in his free time. He worked as a machinist for the firm Carmoc in the 70\u2019s and as a motorist in the 80\u2019s. In 1984 he decided to move to Catembe where he purchased a Singer sewing machine on credit, which allowed him to perform small sewing jobs and save some money. He was able to pay off the machine with no problems.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring his time in Catembe, he worked as a guard and a gardener, but his salary was so low that it was not enough to support the family. That is when he decided to begin construction on the grocery store, in 2000, after the floods. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the little money he earned, he was able to purchase goods for the store and set some money aside for the family ranch, as well as for the children's schooling. With the profits he was able to build a well, buy a freezer, a television set, zinc plates, etc. He currently runs a grocery store where he has been selling a variety of essential products for over 5 years, with no training and no bookkeeping. He does not employ any workers; in his absence, his wife takes care of the business. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan of 18,000 meticais he plans to buy rice, sugar, corn starch, oil and cosmetics. The shop opens at 7:00 a.m. and closes at 9:30 p.m. Business is conducted in the backyard. He purchases goods for resale in Maputo. Like many others, he uses public transportation. There are typically no \u201cpeak\u201d periods, but weekends do see an increased demand. His daily income is 500 MT, and he keeps no record of sales. His biggest constraint is the lack of transportation for his goods when he travels to Maputo, forcing him to buy in smaller quantities. Nevertheless, his monthly profit is 2,500 MT. With the earnings from the store he is able to support the family and pay the monthly fees for his children\u2019s schooling.\r\n<p>\r\nHis future plans involve expansion and an increase in business volume. The business is doing well and he is quite motivated to obtain a little bit of money to purchase a mode of transportation.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Leo Duran, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Bairro Chali, Catembe-Maputo\r\nCliente: Alberto Velasco P.\r\nActividade: Com\u00e9rcio\r\nValor empr\u00e9stimo: 18.000,00MT (720.00US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do empr\u00e9stimo: Compra  de produtos de 1\u00aa necessidade e com\u00e9ticos\r\nIn\u00edcio: 08\/10\/2007\r\nFim:30\/01\/2008\r\n\r\nAlberto Velasco P., nascido em Zavala-Inhambane a 61 anos aos 01 de Mar\u00e7o de 1946, sustenta 7 pessoas , \u00e9 casado maritalmente e estudou at\u00e9 2\u00aa classe.\r\nViveu e cresceu num ambiente familiar com os pais e irm\u00e3os, estudava e nos tempos livres cuidava do gado. \r\nTrabalhou  como maquinista na empresa Carmoc na d\u00e9cada 70 e 80 como motorista.

Eva, 66, was born in Bellavista in the Peruvian \"departamento\" of La Libertad.  She went to a primary school there but no farther and she was needed by her parents from an early age to help out at home.  When she was a young girl, she ran away from her mother's abuse to Huangamarca with the man who is now her husband.\r\n<p>\r\nThey started from nothing after their families refused further help.  They worked buying and selling grain and other foodstuffs but they lacked capital initially so they accepted an invitation from a neighbor to join the Huangamarca community bank.  With their first loan of S\/.300 (300 Peruvian soles or about US$96) from Manuela Ramos, they raised enough money to start their business and ultimately earned enough to buy their house and land for farming.\r\n<p>\r\nEva had two children, one of whom died suddently, something that cast her into a deep depression during which she abandoned the business temporarily.  She eventually overcame the tragedy, though, and returned to the business with the help of a new loan from Manuela Ramos of S\/.1,000 (about US$333), to be repaid in 6 months.  She will use the loan to buy potatoes, wheat and beans that she'll haul to the coast, along with what her husband produces on his plot of land, for sale there.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to buy a house in the city where she can quietly spend her remaining years.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Eva tiene 66 a\u00f1os de edad, naci\u00f3 en el caser\u00edo de Bellavista de la Provincia de Otuzco en el Departamento de La Libertad y estudi\u00f3 s\u00f3lo primaria en la escuela de este caser\u00edo.

She lived with him for 13 years and they had 3 children together.\r\nAfter their separation in 1996, she started selling cigarettes and beer out of her house to create a source of income for her children. She was able to rent the cafeteria at the Namaacha High School with money she made from those sales. In 1999 she opened a store in the local market called Shoprite.<p>\r\nIn the following year, she took over the cafeteria at the Gra\u00e7a Machel de Namacha Elementary School. She was not successful at that location though, for she could only be present during mornings hours and expenses there were too high. At the end of the same year, one of her brothers, who owned a small store in the Sector \"A\", moved away and allowed Ms. C. to take over it. She, then, backed out of the Gra\u00e7a Machel School cafeteria deal and move her merchandise over to her brother's former store. \r\nIn 2006, she rented the district's administration social center. This made her become the owner of a chain of retail outlets that was too big, thus, causing merchandise stock levels to fall to skimpy proportions.

She grew up with her parents and she started her education in the Province's Elementary School. She dropped out when she reached the forth grade due to her parent's poor financial resources- back then they relied solely on their small cropping business for survival.\r\nIn 1976, she married her husband, who worked at the Commercial Investments Bank (BCI). A year later, he was transfered to Namaacha and they relocated there. They lived together for 8 years and had 3 children together. \r\nHer husband passed away in 1984 and she was hired to work as a janitor at the same bank.  She was let go after 9 years of employment when internal shifts were made and her position was branded unnecessary. <p>\r\nThe toughest period of her life had arrived leading her to unsuccessfully sell tomatoes in the streets' corners. Her children were not allowed to attend school anymore because they did not have uniforms to wear nor notebooks to take to class. They could not afford the registration fee either. Essineta, then, borrowed some money from family members and started to cross the border to Swaziland to purchase oil that would be sold in Maputo. Gains achieved with that venture were used to re-enroll their children in school. <p>\r\nIn 1997, her deceased husband's bank called her in to present documents that would make her entitled to a pension to help support their children. She was awarded the pension in that same year and with that money she built a small house on the border's sector. Subsequently, she concentrated her efforts to expand it to better accommodate her children. They were then attending school outside the district and expenses were high.  Two of her children have become professionals: a nurse and a teacher. The youngest is on the 12th grade at the Namaacha's High school. <p>\r\nBy speaking to friends at Women's Savings Planning meetings, she discovered the  Hluvuku \u2013Adsema's program and requested a loan in the amount of 6.000,00Mt, which were applied on the production of building blocks. After having successfully repaid the first loan, she got motivated and decided to request a second loan in the amount of 12.000,00, that will be applied to build additions to her house. \r\nIn the future she plans on furnishing the house to provide better comfort to her children and also build a small store in the same location to increase the family's total income.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o:       Bairro da fronteira- Namaacha\r\nCliente: Essineta jos\u00e9 S.\r\nActividade:         Habita\u00e7\u00e3o\r\nValor solicitado: 15.000,00MT(  600,00US$ )\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o: Compra de material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o\r\nInicio: 01-10-2007\r\nFim: 24-11-2008\r\n\r\nEssineta Jos\u00e9 S., nasceu em 1956 em Gaza , cresceu com seus pais, iniciou os seus estudos numa  Escola Primaria da mesma Prov\u00edncia, abandona os estudos na 4\u00aa classe , devido  a ma condi\u00e7\u00e3o financeira  dos pais, estes que s\u00f3 trabalhavam na machamba .\r\nEm 1976 contraiu matrim\u00f3nio com o seu marido, este  que trabalhava  no Banco Comercial  de Investimento (BCI).

R., 36, is married and has 5 children. She is a professionally-trained seamstress. Guldara has a sales spot at the central market of Nurek, where she sells clothing and shoes for women. She has been in business for 7 years. Guldara plans to use this loan to refresh her inventory and add seasonal items. Nurek is located 80 km from Dushanbe, and it is difficult for many of Nurek\u2019s residents to travel the distance to buy warm clothing there. With the help of this loan, Guldara will be able to offer a collection of seasonal clothing at the local market. Guldara plans to repay this loan with 12 months.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\u0420\u043e\u0437\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430

C. belongs to a village bank called \u201cSumaqcha,\u201d which is Quechua (native language) for \u201cBeautiful Bank.\u201d<p>Anita is a business woman. She sells a variety of different products to a variety of different clients, enabling her to capitalize on several markets. Anita sells clothing, ice cream, cigarettes, and coca leaves. Coca leaves are a very important part of Andean culture here in Ayacucho, Peru. They are used to make a tea or simply chewed and are known for their many medicinal benefits including alleviation of hunger, facilitation of metabolism, and help with altitude sickness. In addition to all of this, Anita also sells fresh fish by the box once every month to individual customers and restaurants. <p>For ten years, Anita has been running her own business, but the truth is that her experience goes back much, much further. Her mother also sold coca leaves, as well as fruit, in the local markets, and Anita grew up watching and learning. Just as she helped her mother, today Anita\u2019s four children also help her in the markets. One daughter is in charge of selling clothes, another is in charge of ice cream, and the other two help where they can. However, because Anita insists that school comes before anything else, they are only allowed to help on Saturdays and Sundays. <p>Everything Anita does, she does for her children\u2019s future. When her husband left the five of them some years ago, Anita had no choice but to work twice as hard to provide for her family as a newly single mother. Her goal is to see all four of her children through to professional degrees. As a means to accomplish this, Anita\u2019s professional goal is to open up her own small grocery store.

The oldest is studying law at a prestigious university in her city, and the youngest is still in college. Because of the estrangement with her husband and the fact that she had recently lost her job, she realized she needed to do something for income.   Aside from all the problems she has had, she never gave up because of her faith.  She came up with the idea to improve her situation with a business selling sodas and cold drinks from her house.   To do this, she bought several cases of sodas and a small aluminum display case which she put in her window.  The disadvantage she has right now is that she is using an old refrigerator that she bought a long time ago, and slowly it is failing to work properly.  It's very important that she buys a new refrigerator as soon as possible in order to keep the drinks cold, as well as other items she sells which must be kept cold.  The loan will enable her to make this critical purchase and provide a better service to her customers, allowing her to continue improving the education of her children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nJuana es una madre separada de su esposo y  vive s\u00f3lo en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus hijos, la mayor estudia leyes en una prestigiosa universidad de su ciudad y  el menor est\u00e1 a\u00fan en las aulas  del colegio, a ra\u00edz del alejamiento  del padre de sus hijos  se encontr\u00f3 en la necesidad de trabajar m\u00e1s a\u00fan porque hace poco hab\u00eda perdido su empleo, a pesar de todo los problemas que se le avecinaron nunca se dej\u00f3 vencer debido a la fe que tiene y le naci\u00f3 la idea de salir adelante trabajando en la venta de golosinas y bebidas heladas en su casa; para ello adquiri\u00f3 unas cuantas cajas de gaseosas y una peque\u00f1a vitrina de aluminio para la exposici\u00f3n de los dulces  que es colocada en la ventana.La desventaja que tiene es que por el momento est\u00e1 utilizando una refrigeradora de segundo uso que  compr\u00f3 hace ya bastante tiempo y poco a poco est\u00e1 dejando de funcionar por los desperfectos que d\u00eda a d\u00eda sufre es por este motivo que  le urge la necesidad de  adquirir una congeladora lo m\u00e1s pronto posible para conservar heladas las bebidas y dem\u00e1s art\u00edculos que necesiten de mantenerse conservados a bajas temperaturas.

Her daily business consists of traveling great distances to the countryside where she buys young bulls and cows. These she takes to her corral outside the city where they stay for several months as she fattens them up to eventually be sold to her clients. She began when her best friend, who is also a stockbreeder, invited her to be a business partner. Together, they began with small products such as eggs and wool, and eventually branched out into the profitable business of stockbreeding.\r\n\r\n<p>This 27-year-old, who lights up the room with her friendly conversation and energetic character, has another business in artesan\u00edas. She and another friend meet on a regular basis to weave beautiful blankets, which she then sells to her many clients. Most of her work is on a contract basis and the majority of her clients are foreigners who wish to return to their country with a colorful souvenir. Mar\u00eda says her goal has always been to save up enough money from both of her businesses and open a small artesan\u00eda shop around the corner from her home. As stockbreeding is a particularly strenuous way to make a living and as Mar\u00eda grows older, opening a small store would become an especially ideal source of income.\r\n\r\n<p>Mar\u00eda says she feels very happy and content to be a part of her village bank because it has taught her how to save her money and earn interest.

G. Y. is part of a village bank called \u201cDesarrollo,\u201d which means \u201cDevelopment\u201d in Spanish.<P>\r\n\r\nFor 15 years Norma has been baking bread to sell to her community. She creates all different types including French bread, and various breads that are traditional in her home region of Ayacucho, Peru. Very early every morning Norma loads her baked goods into a large cart, which she wheels from her home to the corner downtown where she has been selling for the past fifteen years. She stays until about mid-morning and then returns home to bake the evening\u2019s batch. <P>Today Norma is proud of her small business, which she literally started from the ground up. When she began she had just $5 to invest in a loan from her village bank. With this starter, she was able to take out a loan of $50, and with that she bought 25 kilos of dough. She used a very small oven made from stones and began to bake only small \u201cchaplas,\u201d traditional Ayacuchan bread resembling a hollow English muffin and seasoned with anis. Her beginnings were very humble, and Norma says she worked very hard to accomplish what she has today in the form of a growing bread business. <P>\r\n\r\nWhen asked if she has a goal for her business, Norma\u2019s eyes light up and with a tone of resolve she says \u201cabsolutely.\u201d She is in the process of building a large stone oven in her home, since the one she currently uses is rented and three blocks away from her house. Once she has built the oven, she will be able to sell bread from her home while keeping her small business downtown as well. All this she does with the hope of eventually opening her very own real bakery.
