Isabelle Fifam\u00e8 is married to Jacques GBETOHO.The couple have five children of their own and another child in their care. But only certain of the children are at school. The family lives together in Dowa. The couple take responsibility together for the household expenses. Having never been to school, Isabelle Fifam\u00e8 sells condiments for sauces (fresh tomatoes, onions, chili peppers etc.) at the Ouando market in Porto-Novo. She has been carrying out this activity for around five years, and it generates income which she uses to expand the business and meet her children's needs. Isabelle Fifam\u00e8 gets fresh supplies in Nigeria, a country which borders on B\u00e9nin. She has had two loans from ALID\u00e9 and both were repaid without incident. In view of the ruthless competition in this market, Isabelle Fifam\u00e8 would like to strengthen her business and be able to attract her clients more easily. However, she lacks the financial means to do this and for this reason is applying for a third loan from ALID\u00e9.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

B. is a 48-year-old woman who is married and blessed with seven children. She and her husband work together to raised their big family. They are currently living at Taghangin, Morong, Rizal, Philippines. Josephine is a woman with good faith to defeat all challenges to reach her dreams.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Josephine joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.) a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines. As a member of ASHI for almost six years, she has shown very good performance in her attendance at center meetings and weekly repayments. Her business still exists and, therefore, she is qualified to acquire larger loans.\r\n\r\nJosephine runs a variety store. She started her store through her initiative in dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business as it gives her a good income to support the educational needs of her children. She is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000 to use as additional capital to improve her business and her income.\r\n\r\nJosephine dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to other villages. Her seven children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store.\r\n\r\nJosephine now feels very happy with the services of ASHI and Kiva. It gives her a big chance to pursue her family dreams. She hopes that ASHI and Kiva continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":478455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celia B. is from the village of Cabisera 9-11, San Anton, Ilagan, Isabela. She is 45 years old. Celia is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Celia B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nCelia is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Celia operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling personal products, such as lotion and perfumes, in the local community. Celia has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nCelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celia has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Celia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Celia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":478292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Falilath was born in 1972 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  Ten years ago, she got situated in the Foun-Foun quarter, in the 4th district of the city of Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of Benin.  Married to YAYA Mouran, a shipping agent, she is the mother of three children who are all in school.  She lives with her three children and husband.  Together, the couple ensures that family expenses are covered.  \r\n\r\nTo meet her different needs and to help out her husband, Falilath sells food (rice served with sauce; and cornmeal porridge) and also a variety of goods, in Porto-Novo.  She stocks up in Cotonou and at Ikpinl\u00e9, a market for staple foods.  \r\n\r\nFalilath had benefited from two ALID\u00e9 loans, which she has repaid.  Her ambition is to increase the size of her business and to cope better with the demands of her customers.  But given the few financial means at her disposal, she's requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

After having worked in several jobs unsuccessfully, he got introduced  about eight years ago to commercial work, especially in the buying and selling of poultry.  He has a spot at the poultry market of Wayerma I and is in high demand by his customers for the quality of his poultry.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy his burgeoning customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first individual loan.  With this first loan, he intends to buy:  20 chickens, 20 Guinea hens, 10 pairs of turkeys, 5 pairs of ducks, and 4 geese.   He buys his poultry from the villages surrounding Sikasso city, and he sells at the retail level, accepting cash or credit from a diverse and varied customer base.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will essentially be used to cover the loan interest and to invest the rest into his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":478470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T17:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-17T09:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":25238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991368,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021643,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":25238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746433,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778969,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961180,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699344,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T20:53:49Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172022,"name":"Analiza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analiza M. is a new ASHI member.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Khursandmurod is a hard-working man who actively contributes to the well-being of his family by selling vegetable oil in the market. He is married with three children. Khursandmurod spends many hours at his small stand in the market, waiting on his customers. In traditional Tajik cuisine, the majority of the dishes are fried or cooked using cottonseed oil. Especially our national dish \u201cPilau\u201d needs a lot of cottonseed oil in order for it to be delicious. So the goods that Khursandmurod sells are of popular demand among the population.<P>\r\n\r\nKhursandmurod realizes that with the excellent quality and customer service he gives, he can grow his business. Today Khursandmurod is planning to increase his business. For this reason he requests 4600 Somoni. Khursandmurod is counting on your help and thanks you for your support.  <P>   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a hard-working entrepreneur from Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. She and her husband have two children. She runs a business where she sells kids' clothing and women's underwear. <P>\r\n\r\nGulbahor started her business 10 years ago and has run it with extreme care and seriousness. It is an important source of income for her family of four, considering that her husband does not earn enough money to support the family. Gulbahor has requested a loan of 5000 Somoni so that she can purchase additional inventory of winter clothing for kids and to continue developing her business. Thanks to this loan, she will be able to grow her business further and help feed her family.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Born in 1960 in Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of Benin, Ms. D. Genevi\u00e8ve has lived for nineteen years in Djassin, in the 3rd district of the city of Porto-Novo. She is a widow and the mother of six children, who are all in school.  But only three of them are still in her care.  She lives alone with her children, and by herself she ensures that family expenses are covered.  \r\n\r\nGenevi\u00e8ve has never been to school.  To meet the needs of her children, she sells food (cornmeal mash served with different sauces) out of her home.  She stocks up at the Ouando market in Porto-Novo and also in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She has been in this business for five years and has already benefited from two ALID\u00e9 loans, which she has repaid.  \r\n\r\nGenevi\u00e8ve would like to boost her working capital and to increase the quantity of meals made each day.  This will enable her to expand her customer base and to increase her sales.  Lacking sufficient financial means to do so, she is requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Bahriniso is 53 years old. She is married with 6 children. Bahriniso has been selling sportswear for men and boys for the past 15 years. She started because she had been out of work for some time and her children needed things which she couldn\u2019t afford on her husband\u2019s small income. With her savings she started to buy sportswear from her customers wholesale and has been selling it in the local market. Little by little she increased the number of clients and in that way, she has been supporting her children. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, presently the selection of her inventory is poor and therefore she is requesting a loan of 4,800 Somoni. With this loan Bahriniso can purchase new and varied merchandise to offer her customers. With your support she will be able to increase her business and save money for her children\u2019s expenses. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

The primary activities of the businesses in this group are making artisan crafts from plaster, selling various articles of clothing, and selling quick and small meals such as empanadas (folded, stuffed pastries), sopaipillas (fried bread), and mote con huesillo (cooked wheat in a sweet peach syrup-based drink).  These meals are all very typical and traditional meals in Chile.\r\n\r\nFrancisca is a member of \u201cCuento Contigo,\u201d and in the photo above, she is on the right-hand side dressed in a sleeveless blue shirt.  She runs a paqueteria (a place to rent luggage storage lockers) near the bus terminal in Talca, which she runs on her own.  Francisca also makes paper bags, paintings on glass, and ornaments using seeds, products that she also sells from her paqueter\u00eda.  Her plan is to have a greater variety of novelty goods, so she can expand her client base.  Francisca plans to invest this loan in merchandise related to Valentine\u2019s Day coming up on February 14.  Her dream is to own her own home and a permanent location for her business.\r\n\r\nVillage bank \u201cCuento Contigo\u201d is located in Talca.

If the sale of these additional goods is as successful as is expected, Jean Paul will earn more profit which, in turn, will allow him to continue taking care of his children and building a secure future for them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":478581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more goods to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kimironko gasabo kigali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-01-28T09:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Paul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008434,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037667,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760351,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022783,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781849,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709730,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037094,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":64237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172308820,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-28T14:50:01Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172088,"name":"Asadullo","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0422\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0434\u0430\u0442. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 38 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0422\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 7 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443.","en":"Asadullo T. lives in the Vahdat district.

His shop is open from 6:00 AM to 16:00 PM every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre is now requesting a loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company to purchase more food, such as beans, sorghum, and Irish potatoes. With this loan, he hopes to earn more profits, which will help him to save money and pay his children's school fees.

Justine s'approvisionne au Nig\u00e9ria, Etat voisin du B\u00e9nin. Justine a obtenu deux fois de cr\u00e9dits aupr\u00e8s de ALID\u00e9, cr\u00e9dits qu'elle a bien rembours\u00e9s. Justine ambitionne diversifier et \u00e9lever le niveau de son activit\u00e9, pour mieux satisfaire la demande des clients. Cependant Justine ne dispose pas des moyens financiers n\u00e9cessaires pour y parvenir. C'est la raison pour laquelle Justine sollicite un troisi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit aupr\u00e8s de ALID\u00e9. ","en":"Born in 1970, D. Justine has resided for seventeen years in Dj\u00e8r\u00e8gb\u00e9 Gbokpa, a few kilometers from Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of Benin.  She is married to HOUNNEHEKPON Marcellin, a mason.  The couple has five children to support, of whom four are their own.  The children are all in school and live together with their parents in Dj\u00e8r\u00e8gb\u00e9.  Justine helps out her husband where it concerns the different family expenses thanks to the revenues her business brings in.  \r\n\r\nJustine never attended school.  A year ago, she started selling various goods (Klin laundry soap and Jago milk) at Dantokpa, the international market of Benin.  She stocks up from Nigeria, a country neighboring Benin.  \r\n\r\nJustine has twice obtained ALID\u00e9 loans, which she has repaid.  Her ambition is to diversify her business and to raise its level in order to satisfy customer demand more.  However, she lacks the necessary financial means to do so.  For these reasons, she is requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":478619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying boxes of KLIN soap and boxes of JAGO products ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T20:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10678.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859102,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":21356.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495179,"comment":null},{"amount":46.29,"local_amount":20200,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":21569.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619243,"comment":null},{"amount":22.46,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10464.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954159,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":32034.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055819,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10678.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347362,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10678.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482492,"comment":null},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10678.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T20:19:58Z","paid_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172106,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el municipio El Sauce del departamento de Le\u00f3n, el se\u00f1or Natividad R. se dedica a su actividad de ganader\u00eda donde a diario da lugar a la crianza de estos animales buscando la manera de realizar el engorde y as\u00ed extraerles el m\u00e1ximo provecho para obtener los ingresos para su familia.\nEl se\u00f1or R. es casado y con cuatro hijos que mantener por lo que busca la manera de mejorar sus  condiciones de vida para que su familia salga adelante y a pesar de las dificultades, proyectarse para mejorar.

Laurence is divorced from her husband and has a school-age child.  Laurence lives alone and is solely responsible for the household expenses.  Laurence attended school up until High School.  When she failed her school year, Laurence began selling foodstuffs (maize, rice, beans, etc.) and has been doing so with great energy for roughly 15 years; this allows her to meet her various needs.

He is married and has three children, ages 15, 13 and 11, who are in public school. Francisco started taking pictures with a borrowed camera, and little by little he raised money to purchase chemicals to make chlorine and also started a business selling charcoal. Now he and his wife work every day from 7 a.m.-9 p.m. selling chlorine by the liter and gallon and also cases of charcoal. He no longer takes pictures because he doesn't have a camera, and up until this point he has not had any complications with his business. With the loan he is requesting, he plans to purchase a camera so he can take up photography again, as well as purchase chemicals to make chlorine.

Her children are all in school, with the youngest in fifth grade and the oldest a freshman in the university.  Watta herself was never able to go to school and has difficulty reading and writing.\r\n\r\nWatta started her business selling cloth, fabric, thread, and linen about 21 years ago with $40 U.S. in starter capital provided by her father as a wedding gift.  Watta sells at the Red Light Market, a bustling area full of shops, stalls, and tabletop and mobile sellers and trades people.  Red Light is Liberia's largest market and is on the outskirts of Monrovia, the capital of the country.  Watta credits her success at business with talking to customers in a polite manner.\r\n\r\nWatta plans to use her 12,000 Liberian dollar share of this 60,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy trousers, wedding garments, and other goods for her business.  Someday, she dreams of getting into real estate as a business.

This bank meets in a sector called Forest Park on the outskirts of the city.  It is composed of 20 associates, among them the lady Silvia R. for two loan cycles.  \r\n\r\nSilvia has been married for 13 years and is the mother of three children.  Her husband works in home construction and she has to be more than a housewife also.  She is dedicated to their small store where she sells convenience products, milk, meats, and more.  This business was started at the urging of her mom who gave them a place in her house for the store so they would not have to pay rent. Already they have had the business for two years and it goes very well.  With the aid that the foundation offers, she has been able to continue supplying merchandise and to grow a little bit more each day.  She tells us that she began with 300 dollars and now her investment is greater.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan she will buy rice, sugar, oil, salt, water, flour, etc. wholesale to supply her business and to offer more and better products to her clients.  Her schedule of service is every day from 7 am to 8pm, for which she leaves her home and goes to her mother's house a few blocks away to tend her business.  \r\n\r\nThe dream of Silvia is to some day have a restaurant, since she likes to prepare food.  She would like this dream to become reality therefore she is saving to achieve it.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva

He is 34 years old and married with two children, who are 8 and 5 years old and in kindergarten and third grade. Jacob and his family live in the Freeport Community, near the Sea Port of Monrovia and located close to downtown Monrovia. He works at the intersection of Randall and Water Street in downtown Monrovia. Jacob is a high school graduate.\r\n\r\nJacob\u2019s business is the sale of food such as rice, beans, etc. He buys his goods from wholesalers and sells retail on a table in downtown Monrovia. He has been running this business for 16 years and hopes to become an importer and exporter of general goods to Liberia in the near future.\r\n\r\nJacob started selling with 4000.00 Liberian Dollars as working capital but now operates with 12000.00 Liberian Dollars. He has faced difficulty with siting his business, because he does not have a stable site.  He sells quality goods and interacts with his customers in order to encourage them to continue buying from him.\r\n\r\nJacob needs this loan to purchase more rice, oil, beans, etc., for resale.  He dreams and hopes that he and his family will remain in good health.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Jacob is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\n<b>About LEAP:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution, with 13 branches across the country. Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship. LEAP, a Kiva partner, seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to

She is 44 years old and is married with six children aged seven to 25 years old. Their educational levels are third grade through high school graduate. Siah also cares for two nieces and a nephew.\r\n\r\nSiah herself did not go to school due to poverty. She and her family live in the Redlight Wood Camp community and she works in the Redlight market, the largest market in Liberia.  \r\n\r\nSiah\u2019s business is the sales of general goods such as hardware and used clothes from a table at the market. She buys her goods from wholesalers and sells retail in the Redlight market.  She has been running this business for more than 20 years and hopes to own a shop in the near future.\r\n\r\nSiah started her business dealings with only 20 Liberian dollars that she used to purchase eight pieces of used clothes which she sold for 10 Liberian Dollars each. It was at that point that she grew the momentum to do business.  She talks to her customers in a good manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her.  Siah needs this loan to purchase additional hardware and used clothes for resale.  She dreams of giving her children a good education.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Siah is the one holding the sign.  Joseph F. is inset at lower right.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.  LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":477761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" To purchase additional hardware and used clothes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Red Light, Paynesville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-01-28T07:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yawah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1239},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2205}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.55,"local_amount":1239,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1246.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952549,"comment":null},{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":2213,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952550,"comment":null},{"amount":137.74,"local_amount":9723,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":9779.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128985533,"comment":null},{"amount":113.19,"local_amount":7990,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":8036.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711344,"comment":null},{"amount":113.26,"local_amount":7995,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8041.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144997899,"comment":null},{"amount":11.91,"local_amount":840,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":844.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159667377,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-28T08:08:52Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172168,"name":"Divino Ni\u00f1o Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal \u201cDIVINO NI\u00d1O\u201d est\u00e1 ubicado por una avenid, todas las socias son del mismo barrio, las socias son  muy unidas, es un grupo muy organizado, es su 1\u00ba ciclo son personas dedicadas a trabajar, para engrandecer su negocio Maria Roci\u00f3 es la Presidenta es una persona muy responsable, Yaneth es la Secretaria, y Susana es la Tesorera.

","en":"The group \"Nuevo Horizonte\" (New Horizon) is very close and the members have businesses in the same central area of their town.  Some of the group lives in rented homes, others in houses loaned to them by in-laws or parents, and others own their own homes.  \r\n\r\nThe group is maD. up of 10 members, of whom 3 are men and 7 are women.  Half of the members sell snack food, the rest sell groceries and have a computer business.  Marisel Shirley, the president of the group, has been a wholesaler of telephone cards for the past 10 years.  Julia has had a snack business for 15 years.  AyD. has a snack shop and has also had a general store for 10 years.  Leoncia has been selling groceries for about 20 years.  Amanda has had a business for 6 years.  Marcia Olivia has sold shoes for 3 years.  Maria Angelica sells clothing and has been in this business for 20 years.  Ross Aurelio has been selling computer equipment for 6 years.  Freddy has had a small restaurant where he offers lunches and other meals for 23 years.  Nestor Hector has been making glass for 15 years.  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, in general the group has a great deal of experience in their respective areas.  As with all businesses in the country, there is competition, but the good thing is that each group has its season. This group is going to invest in order to make money during the Carnival parties.  The loan will be used to purchase more merchandise to stock a business such as a snack stand, or for a person who makes meals to have a stand in the market.  The people with computer businesses will purchase accessories that they will sell, the glass maker will purchase frames and glass for sale and for his monthly jobs.   \r\n\r\nThe business people who request loans from Agrocapital hope to improve their businesses with the help of the loan.  They hope to improve their children's education, improve their quality of life, and to grow and expand their businesses.  The members of this group are experienced with loans and are very accustomed to working with loans as they already know how to use them in their businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":478737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisel Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leoncia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ross Aurelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nestor Hector","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21025,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1994.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2017.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2065.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2089.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2113.52},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2138.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2163.07},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2188.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":284.58,"local_amount":1994.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1997.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909421,"comment":null},{"amount":287.9,"local_amount":2017.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909422,"comment":null},{"amount":610.67,"local_amount":4279.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4286.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944997,"comment":null},{"amount":880,"local_amount":6167.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6177.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673336,"comment":null},{"amount":308.64,"local_amount":2163.07,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707356,"comment":null},{"amount":312.24,"local_amount":2188.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2191.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707357,"comment":null},{"amount":315.97,"local_amount":2214.43,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890877,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T23:29:39Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172171,"name":"Unidos Podemos 9 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maritza is the coordinator of her group Unidos Podemos (United We Can), and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business running a small colmado or cornerstore, by supplying it with cooking oil, rice, beans, powdered milk and other basic necessities. She will use the profits to save towards investing in a separate location for her colmado, which she currently runs out of her house. She thanks you all for your support. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":478738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

De esta manera, las carreras de caballo, corrida de toros, bailes, danzas, juego de sortija, de dados, de naipes, de ruleta y de bisb\u00eds, maroma, ri\u00f1a de gallos, fuegos artificiales y toda clase de diversiones, tambi\u00e9n han caminado con el paisa donde este se ubica \". Para la muestra, Tormenta, la tienda de C\u00e9sar y su esposa, es un sitio donde un paisa encuentra su escencia, pues est\u00e1 ubicada al lado de un club de socios de caballo que con sus familias componen gran parte de su clientela, all\u00ed se divierten y consumen alimentos, refrescos y otros productos que puede encontrar a cualquier hora del d\u00eda y de la noche. En la tienda Tormenta, nombre en honor  a un caballo muy especial,  observa colgadas en las paredes, hermosas  fotograf\u00edas de estos especimenes  que deleitan la vista de los aficionados y hacen de este lugar el perfecto para  compartir intereses paisas comunes y donde se integran tambi\u00e9n gran parte de los vecinos solede\u00f1os (de Soledad Atl\u00e1ntico) y otros que vienen desde Barranquilla.\n\nComo una persona \"echada para adelante\" y con amplia capacidad de riesgo, se describe a si mismo C\u00e9sar V\u00e1squez, jefe de familia de 30 a\u00f1os y propietario de esta tienda- estadero del barrio Centenario en el municipio de Soledad, donde trabaja hombro a hombro al lado de su esposa,  ambos de origen antioque\u00f1o de Granada y de C\u00e1ceres respectivamente; tienen dos  hijos de 13 y 4 a\u00f1os, que son el motor que los impulsa  a trabajar continuamente para verlos convertir en profesionales y para que cuenten con todas las herramientas para enfrentar la vida de manera independiente, persistir  y progresar , venciendo los obst\u00e1culos que se le presenten.\n\nCesar lleva grabada la imagen de su padre tambi\u00e9n paisa, como un excelente trabajador y hombre sabio que sacaba cuentas como un experto; aunque este  siempre impuls\u00f3 a Cesar al estudio, este \u00faltimo se inclin\u00f3 desde muy joven por el trabajo,  por eso empez\u00f3 con su padre su primera labor en  el campo, donde desarroll\u00f3 la gran capacidad que hoy posee; de \u00e9l aprendi\u00f3 el manejo de cuentas y ahora lo hace con una habilidad natural, que todos los d\u00edas potencia con su negocio.\n\nEste es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; cuando empez\u00f3 con esta organizaci\u00f3n solo ten\u00eda un estadero, con este cr\u00e9dito compr\u00f3 estanter\u00edas y mercanc\u00eda. Su \u00e9xito radica en que la gente de los barrios m\u00e1s pobres compra mas en tienda que en supermercado, a \u00e9l le gusta la ubicaci\u00f3n de su negocio porque obtiene m\u00e1s utilidades. Cesar est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de $2.000.000 y lo invertir\u00e1 para ampliar el surtido de abarrotes en su negocio, por ejemplo los fr\u00edjoles, papas, granos, arroz y lentejas.\n\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1, su sue\u00f1o es montar un supermercado como las grandes cadenas y aspira que Dios le d\u00e9 la oportunidad mediante su trabajo. Usa las utilidades generadas por su negocio para cubrir los gastos de la seguridad  social de \u00e9l y su familia y para sostener a su familia dignamente. Cesar y su esposa saben que sus esfuerzos no son en vano, porque con su trabajo honrado est\u00e1n construyendo un mejor vivir para el futuro de ellos y de sus hijos.\n\n","en":"When visiting the shop of Cesar V\u00e1squez, one does not think of Antioquia, the district located in northwest Colombia that is isolated by the Cordillera Central (one of three main branches of the Andean mountain range).  The inhabitants of this area were forced to work hard to fend for themselves.  Anyone living in \u201cEl Paisa\u201d (which refers to the districts of Antioquia, Risaralda, Caldas, and Quind\u00edo located north of Cauca Valley and northwest of Tolima) had to find their own food from other parts of the country in order to survive.  Their own culture developed as a result of their drive, perseverance, and backbreaking work before finally settling in an area in the heart of the country.  When walking through the region of \u201cEl Paisa\u201d, one can see the forms of entertainment that resulted such as horse races, bull fights, dances, ring games, cards, dice, roulette, tightrope walking, cock fights, and fireworks.  For example, Tormenta, the name of the store owned by Cesar and his wife, is situated in an area of \u201cEl Paisa\u201d where the region finds its identity.  The store is located next to a horse riding club where the members and their families come to Cesar\u2019s establishment to have fun and buy food, refreshments, and other products any time of day or night.  Tormenta was named after a very special horse.  Photographs of this beautiful specimen decorate the walls to the delight of its admirers, which makes Cesar\u2019s store a perfect communal gathering place and an ideal place to visit for those coming from the neighboring region of Soledad Atl\u00e1ntico or from Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nCesar V\u00e1squez describes himself as a person prone to succeed and willing to take risks.  He is a 30 year old head of household and proprietor of his own store, located in the neighborhood of Centenario in the city of Soledad.  He and his wife work together, hand in hand.    Both of them are natives of Granada and C\u00e1ceres respectively.  They have two children, ages 13 and 4, who are the driving force for them to become working professionals and have all the necessary tools to live independently, be persistent, progress in life, and overcome any obstacles.\r\n\r\nCesar is a striking image of his father who, like any Paisan, was an excellent worker who made good use of his expertise.  He drove Cesar to study.  In return, Cesar was inclined to work hard from a young age.  He started working with his father in the fields, where he developed many of the skills he uses today.  Cesar manages his business every day with what appears to be almost a natural ability.  \r\n\r\nCesar is receiving his second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  When he started with the organization, it only had one location.  With this loan, he plans to purchase shelving and merchandise.  His success is attributed to serving the people from the poorest neighborhoods, who shop more at his store than at a supermarket.  He likes the location of his business because of its many advantages.  Cesar will use his loan of 2,000,000 COP to increase his inventory of groceries such as beans, potatoes, grain, rice, and lentils.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, his dream is to establish a large supermarket chain and aspires that God will give him such an opportunity in his work.  With the profits from his business, he is able to cover his expenses and pay for Social Security for himself and his family so that they can continue to have a decent lifestyle.  Cesar and his wife know that their efforts are not in vain because their honest labor will build a better life and future for themselves and their children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

All the members of the group are mothers and fathers whose children are their principal preoccupation, especially with regards to their educations and futures. Many of the partners have more than one job to cover their children's needs as well as many obligations to suppliers and banks.  For this reason, they need a loan that will help them get working capital to buy inputs, merchandise, materials, and tools that will help them improve their final products and businesses so that they can make money, which would translate into a better quality of life for their families. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the female partners work selling food, bread, or cosmetics or work as domestic employees.  The male partners work in agriculture, public transportation, caretaking for houses, gardening, or construction.  For example, the president of the group is a waitress in a restaurant and uses her free time to selling cosmetics from a catalog so that she can dedicate herself to her little boy, who is her reason for living.  She lives together with her parents who help her pay basic costs, but what she wants more than anything is to be independent. She wants to buy a a lot so she can have a more comfortable house, where her parents can also live with her.\r\n\r\nThe competition among small businesses is high, but the group's partners know how to get ahead.  The partners are now in their second loan cycle, which demonstrates their responsibility, honesty, and ability to get ahead with hard work and effort so that they can improve the quality of life for them and their families.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":478771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yackeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Angelica Marioly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2345.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2372.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2400},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2427.61},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2455.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2483.8},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2512.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2541.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2570.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2600.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2660.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":338.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172184,"name":"Las Estrellas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal \u201cLas Estrellas\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Neidy y conformado por 12 miembros los cuales una gran mayor\u00eda se encuentra ubicado en el Plan 3000 todas son del Barrio y se conocen desde hace mucho tiempo por lo conf\u00edan en sus compa\u00f1eros (as),  es un grupo muy organizado a pesar de ser su 1\u00ba ciclo han demostrado ser muy trabajadoras y madres dedicadas, por ejemplo la presidenta se dedica a ayudar en la soldadura de arco y oxigeno a su esposo haciendo puertas, rastrillos y hasta armar carretillas por lo que ya tienen bastante experiencia, ella esta muy contenta de trabajar en su propia casa serca de sus hijos y junto con su esposo ya que no muchas mujeres que trabajan pueden compartir esa experiencia con sus familias; el resto de las socias se dedican a diferentes actividades como la venta de ropa, elaboraci\u00f3n y distribuci\u00f3n de empanadas, dulces, comida, verdura y al servicio de transporte p\u00fablico.

This is very organized group despite this being their first loan cycle, and the members have shown themselves to be very hard-working and dedicated mothers. For example, the group's president makes a living helping her husband weld doors, rakes and wheelbarrows, and they already have a good amount of experience. Neidy is very pleased with working out of her own home beside her husband and close to her children since there aren't many women who work and can share that experience with their families. The rest of the members make a living in different activities such as selling clothing, making and distributing empanadas, candy, vegetables and other food items, and in public transportation. The members say they have a lot of competition, but they keep working to make headway and improve the quality of life for their families. They plan to use to loan to purchase tools such as compressors and grinders, summer clothing to sell, ingredients and materials to make and sell empanadas and other foods, and to repair the vehicles that are the source of income for those who work in transportation. Despite this being the group's first loan, the members are already experienced with group loans from similar organizations, so they know how to use the funds to grow their business and increase their income, which will translate into a better education for their children and a better quality of life for their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":478778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liceth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banesa Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roly Ever","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eldy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1440.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1473.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1490.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1508.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1525.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1560.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":628.45,"local_amount":4371.8,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4411.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909425,"comment":null},{"amount":214.32,"local_amount":1490.93,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909426,"comment":null},{"amount":216.79,"local_amount":1508.09,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945000,"comment":null},{"amount":219.28,"local_amount":1525.44,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945001,"comment":null},{"amount":221.8,"local_amount":1543,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1557.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673338,"comment":null},{"amount":224.36,"local_amount":1560.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1574.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673339,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-02T09:42:18Z","paid_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172186,"name":"Darlin Marcelino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Darlin Marcelino tiene 30 a\u00f1os, su actividad econ\u00f3mica es la compra y venta.

This group has ten members. They are beginning their first loan cycle.  They have a lot of hope to grow their businesses since an institution that has confidence in their capacity and their desire to expand and move forward backs them. The majority of the members sell products such as clothes, fish, vegetables, breakfast, potatoes and prepared food. For example, the president sells fruit. She is in her stall in the Bolivar Market most of her time. Some of the time she is also caring for her children in her stall, as she doesn\u2019t have anyone else to care for them. She hopes to proviD. her children with a good education so that they can have a good future. It is because of this that Mrs. Carolina works so hard each day. She has to support her young ones and maintain her home. In the competitive sense, she would like to mention that the members ought to have good quality products to offer to their customers. For this reason they are asking for a loan to increase their working capital and increase their inventory with competitive products. Other members would like to invest in the repair of their stalls in order to give their customers a more comfortable experience. These members sell breakfast. The remaining members want to offer a greater variety of products in order to increase their earnings. Because of the competition, many members have had to stop selling certain products. With effort and dedication the members know how to move forward and bring the bread home each day to their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva

She is 33 years old. Anecita is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAnecita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Anecita owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling daily use products such as biscuits, candies, shampoo, soap, toothpaste and other daily use products in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $116 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Anecita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Anecita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Jocelyn is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be her 1st loan from GDMPC.

Norm C. is 51 years old, and she lives in Tonle village in Takeo province.   She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice on to support her family. Her husband, Mr. Sumbat Moung, is a palm juice collector. This family has a problem because her husband can obtain a lot of palm juice, so he must sell palm juice far from his village, but he does not have a motorbike to transport it to sell. Thus, Mrs. Norm C. decided to request a loan to buy a new motorbike for their palm juice business to increase income. She is a mother of two children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory, while the other is enrolled in a local public school. Her husband is also in the photo.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with previous loans, she has been able to borrow 18 times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to buy auto parts for their jeep.   \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 25,000 loan. This amount will be used for registration expenses and the purchase of needed auto parts for their jeep.\r\n\r\nEditha dreams that someday they will buy a van to be used as a transport service so that they will earn enough money to finance their children's college education. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNorma is married and has five school-aged children. Norma owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Norma has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 10,000.00 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Norma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Norma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from PMPC. Norma is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Norma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is a woman of courage to battle challenges in order to achieve her goals in life. She is 46 years old and married to Virgilio, 46, who is a fisherman. She is a caring mother of two children who are both of minor age. She lives in the coastal place of Talim Island, town of Binangonan, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with an opportunity of having start-up funds for generating income. Since she received loans from ASHI, she carefully invested it in her fishing business and it gave her reasonable earnings. \r\n\r\nNow on her fourth loan, she requests 20,000 Philippine pesos for additional working capital for her fishing business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase a fishnet, rope, bamboo, fingerlings (young or very small fish) and labor expenses. She also plans to buy one motorboat to consistently visit their fish pond.\r\n\r\nAs a mother, Arlene dreams of sending her two children to school and on to completing college degrees and finding jobs for healthier lives. She also enjoys considering that the loan from ASHI will change their lives and provide her family's needs. She also dreams of building a big house for her family to live in.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":479151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase fishnet,

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anipa is the leader of this group. Anipa is 40. She has a big family that consists of her, her husband and four children. Anipa lives in the city of Karabalta, which is 60 kilometers to the west of Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nOne of the main life priorities for Anipa has been to give all her children a proper education so that they have more favorable opportunities in their lives. To provide it, they saved their earnings and invested in purchasing a calf. Gradually, they increased the total population of livestock and began selling milk. Now, Anipa can boast about what a good household she and her husband together operate. \r\n\r\nTheir eldest daughter has become a schoolteacher herself, and she is just 20. Two other children are still attending a secondary school. The little son is just 5 and stays at home by Anipa\u2019s side. Raising livestock has been the main source of income for Anipa and her family for 25 years. And due to it, Anipa has been successfully raising her children and satisfying her daily needs. \r\n\r\nRecently, Anipa has applied for this loan. The reason for that is that for the rest of the winter season, Anipa urgently needs coal for heating her house. However, her monthly income of $73 does not allow her to make this purchase. Therefore, she hopes to obtain this loan and be able to buy coal. \r\n\r\nAnipa\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nTemirbek, 56, is the father of four children. His wife is unemployed. Temirbek is engaged in breeding cattle and selling milk. He needs a loan to buy a piece of land for his son. His son is married and needs to build his own household.\r\n\r\nFlyura, 43, is a housewife. She keeps a household and sells milk. Her husband works as a welder. Together they are raising five children. Flyura needs to obtain this loan to be able to attend a funeral of a close relative of hers. \r\n\r\nDinara, 38, is a mother of five children. Her husband and elder children support the family by keeping sheep. They have applied for this loan to purchase furniture.\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

M., of Teresa, Rizal Province in the Philippines. is a 40-year-old mother of two boys, both college students. A strong and courageous mother, she is married to Edilberto, a 41-year-old caretaker. She and her husband are active church members in their village. <p>\r\n\r\nAs a woman of dreams, in 2005 she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), a Microfinance Institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since then, Leonila started a canteen (outdoor caf\u00e9) business that has really helped the family meet its educational and living expenses.  Her previous loan played an important role in developing the business and subsequent increased business profits permitted the purchase of a motorcycle. Now she is requesting a new loan of 45,000 pesos as additional working capital to purchase more stocks for her canteen.<p>\r\n\r\nLeonila hopes that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA, she can achieve her main dream in life: sending her children to school until they find jobs. Leonila also extends her helping hand to her niece and nephew to bring them to school and make education their priority.  She also dreams of a successful business, and even plans to have an Internet cafe in the future. Now, she says, her dreams are nearly within her reach.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":479178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Additional

is a math teacher who lives with her husband and their 3- and 7-year-old daughters. She has lived in the city for the past eight years. She took out a clean-fuel loan to help her save money and to reduce air pollution in the city. Davaa said that the fuel \u201chas many advantages, including the need to use less of it than regular fuel and that keeps us warmer. It is an especially nice opportunity for people who have a low income to purchase the fuel through a loan. By using this cleaner fuel, we use less fuel. For example, we previously had to burn extra fuel at night, but now we don\u2019t need to do that because the new fuel burns longer.\u201d \r\n\r\nAbout XacBank Eco Products Program\r\n\r\nUlaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city's population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts.

F. is from the village of Casili, Mallig, Isabela. She is 28 years old. Sharon is married and has 2 school-aged children.  Sharon owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Sharon has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month (about $172 US) for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Sharon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Sharon from ASKI.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP, which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Sharon is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product line.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Oeun R. cares for a school-aged child. To make a daily income, Oeun R. sews clothes in the garment industry and has a fixed salary of $90 per month. Another source of family income is her husband\u2019s fishing business.

She is a single mother to Alice Karim (17 years old,  just finished high school), Judy Jepchumba (15 years old, in Form Three in high school) and Edwin Kipyegomen (20 years old, finished high school awhile back). Ann lives in Kaptimbor village.\r\n\r\nAnn is a second hand clothes trader and has been in this business for six years. The business gives her a monthly profit of about 50,000 KES but she also gets an additional 16,000 KES from other sources, including farming. Her business is situated within town.\r\n\r\nAnn was introduced to KADET Limited by company staff and she had no previous credit history.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Edmund G..<p>\r\n\r\nMarried with two school-aged children, Edmund owns and operates a specialized retail store whose main income comes from selling rice in the local community. Edmund has been engaged in his business for over a year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2010, he joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edmund is now requesting a loan of 4000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell, and he plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his store. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly  farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Fidele lives together with her children and husband in Agbalilame, Cotonou. The couple have lived in this neighborhood for about 3 years. Fidele and her husband are able to meet the needs of the family. Fidele did not attended school and to make a living, she has been selling akassa (a corn based food) for the last two years.

Through the training she has undergone, Fe has kept in her heart and mind the significance of the moral values that a person should posses once she is trusted.

Despite that, she still feels happy that at least all of them have been to college and two have graduated thanks to her business proceeds. She is happy not only because of the achievements of her family but also because of her ability to help other small-business people in her community.\r\n\r\nThe nature of Fe\u2019s business is buying and selling fish. She has a stall in the town\u2019s public market and her whole family are participating in her business. When fish is in season and Fe has a large amount of capital to purchase a large volume of fish, she ventures to trade in other municipalities and even in the neighboring province.\r\n\r\nLittle by little Fe notices her life has changed as her business progresses. For its sustainability and growth, she wants to request another loan of Php 45,000.

She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently.\r\n\r\nBecause of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, Eleanor was able to borrow six times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy raw materials for her rag-making business. Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 3,200 per month.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Eleanor would like to obtain a PHP 8,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying raw materials needed for making doormats and rags.\r\n\r\nEleanor dreams that her children will be able to finish their studies someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow nine times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.

Her two businesses let her earn a profit of PHP 5,500 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying assorted snacks and beverages for her store and additional products for her direct selling business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will grow so that her youngest child can finish college and help all her children improve their lives. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

G. is a 48-year-old mother of two children who are 23 and 25 years old. She joined ASHI in 1996, wanting to achieve her dream of giving her children a better kind of life and rise above from poverty. Loans she had requested all throughout her membership had been very significant in changing her life and her family\u2019s. Because of them, she has able to have a fishing and fish selling business as a source of her family daily finances as well as giving her husband a livelihood to manage. Anita\u2019s husband is the one that manages the motor fishing boat she purchased through her previous loan from ASHI. She sells the fish in the market. When business capital and profits from the business are larger enough, she purchases a large volume of fish from other fishermen and trades them to other neighboring municipalities. Since she has paid up her previous loan, she requests a much larger amount of loan for the same purpose. Through this, her business will grow and eventually she will accomplish her dream of helping her husband support the needs of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":479271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

M., 57, is making sure that her family has adequate provision for their daily needs. Married to Mauro M., a church pastor, she is blessed with five children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been making and selling slippers for sixteen years.\n\nConchita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends its weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently.\n\nBecause of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, Conchita was able to borrow five times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy raw materials for her slipper-making business. Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 15,700 per month.\n\nNow, with your help, Conchita would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business and used to buy materials needed for making slippers.\n\nConchita dreams that her business will help provide the financial support that is needed for her son\u2019s education in college.\n\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":479278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

Daizy O. lives in one of the very remote municipalities of Antique Province. In the small town of Libertad, with her three children, whose ages range from four to eight years old, and her loving husband, Daizy dreamed of having a life that is simply happy. Instead of focusing on negative thoughts and emotions brought about by poverty, as a mother and a wife Daizy knew that she served as the light for her family, especially for her children, to keep from succumbing to the trials of life. She tries to see opportunities that life can offer them beyond being poor. Though she discovered a lot, it was in 1997 when she found the greatest of all. That was when she became a member of ASHI, a Kiva field partner in the Philippines. \r\n<p>\r\nThrough ASHI, Daizy has been able to obtain credit and has started her own small business. Over time, the loan amount she qualifies for has increased, as her hog-fattening business has grown. The larger the volume of hogs she sells (either alive or slaughtered--the pork is sold per kilo after four months of fattening), the more she profits. Daizy's business proceeds since then have been a great provider of food and other basic commodities her family's needs. She is no longer dependent on her husband\u2019s sporadic and small income; instead she takes part in earning money. \r\n<p>\r\nDaizy has been so happy with her achievements since obtaining membership in ASHI because she feels that she has helped not just her family but also people who live in their inaccessible village. The pork and pigs she sells has brought people convenient access to food. Therefore, Daizy would like to request another loan, which she will use for growing her business. That way she will be able to increase the number of hogs she is raising and selling, and increase the profits which improve her family's lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":479288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

A. is a 34-year-old woman with a strong faith to get away from the ties of poverty. She is a loving mother to three children who are all of minor age. The oldest is only 11 years old and the youngest is a nine-month-old baby. She is married to John Arnold, an electrical reliever. Her husband's salary is insufficient for their daily expenditures.\r\n\r\nAs a woman of courage, in 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), a Microfinance Institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since obtaining a loan from ASHI, she started a fishing business and it truly helped them to sustain their needs.\r\n\r\nNow for her fourth loan, she proposes the amount of 20,000 PHP to pay for five packs of nylon rope, fishnet, bamboo, fingerlings (small fish) and labor expenses to construct a fishpond.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA, she can reach her goals of a bigger

Furkat is 31 years old and is not married. He is a very diligent and hard-working man who uses his car to provide taxi services. Furkat\u2019s usual itinerary is Kanibadam-Khujand.\n\nFor the last two years Furkat\u2019s business had been the main income for the family allowing him to improve the living conditions of his large family. Currently, his daily income is about 80-100 Somoni.\n\nAs any business generating income, Furkat\u2019s business also requires some investment from time to time. Thus, now the car needs a thorough overhaul. For this reason he requests 1,500 USD. He promises to repay the loan promptly and thanks all those supporting him.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Karim is an agricultural producer who has been working in this sphere of business for eleven years. He is a family man and feels responsible for supporting his three children who need help with their education. His wife is a very hardworking woman who also supports him in his production activities in order to improve their lives and be able to go on with their family life. \r\n\r\nAware of the needs his family is going through, Karim requested and received a loan from IMON International three years ago. He used that loan to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer for his harvest. Karim comes to IMON International today again to ask for a loan that may allow him to go on with his business and give his very beloved family the support they deserve.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Muhamad is 49 years old. He is married with two children. Muhamad has a small cafe where he sells breakfast, lunch and dinner. When he first started his business he only opened to sell breakfast because he worked at night. Once his place became more popular he was able to dedicate himself to the business full time. \r\n\r\nMuhamad wants the loan so he may invest in tables, chairs and utensils. He is asking for 4500 Somoni. With this money, Muhamad will be able to expand his business, to earn more profit and in turn help his children move forward to complete their school studies and further continue studying at the university. The well-being of this family is in your hands. Contribute to the growth of his business and they will be grateful. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Mahmud is 36 years old. He is married with two children. He is a small entrepreneur who sells different kinds of foodstuffs like: cookies, candies, soft drinks, juices, macaroni, detergents and many others in his grocery store which he built 4 years ago. Today Mahmud is requesting a loan of $1500 US to increase his stock. \r\n\r\nHe is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once and awhile to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. One of his dreams is that his children progress by means of their studies, for which he is doing his best. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Together with his family he works hard in the field, hoping to have a good crop yield. He is proud of their farm because it allows him to feed and educate his family. Abdusalom wants to borrow $800 USD that will be used to buy fertilizer and pesticides, and will make a small investment in land preparation. Abdusalom was born and raised in Kanibadam, but he hopes his children can get an education and move to a bigger city. His main short-term goal is to make all the land he owns productive, as certain sectors have not been prepared for farming.    \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is 53 years old. She is married, with two children. Together with her husband (pictured) Shahzoda, she has already been running the business for 15 years. She sells household products. All the goods are imported from neighboring cities. The business generates significant income for the family, allowing them to improve their living conditions. Today Gahvarkhon is requesting 9000 Somoni. She is going to spend the loan on purchasing new goods. In borrowing from IMON since 2005, Gahvarkhon has shown herself to be a reliable client with a good credit history. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Makhsura is 35 years old. She is married and has a son. Makhsura's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the home and of her little daughter. This was the reason that Makhsura decided to start her own business eight years ago, selling fabric for national dresses. Little by little, she has made her business grow and by offering installment payments to her clients, her orders are getting bigger. Now her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue bettering herself and her business. She is asking for a loan of $1,100 USD. With this money, Makhsura will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for national dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Gonzalez.  They have three children (25, 22, and 19).  They are a family with scarce economic resources.  Their oldest daughter studied for a professional career (Auditor), but necessity obligated her to leave the country to work.  She went to Spain to work, and therefore left her studies.\r\n\r\nPablo and his family live in the city of Cochabamba in the Maica Central community.  They have their own small house with only two rooms in which all of them somehow have to be comfortable.  His main activity is producing raw milk.  He currently has six head of dairy cows.  He delivers his product to a business that produces different dairy products.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy a dairy cow, which will increase his raw milk production.

He went to Spain to work, and he returned two years ago.  In Spain he was able to get together enough money to buy a taxi.  He currently works as a taxi driver, and he also helps his parents with the production of raw milk.\r\n\r\nRonald lives with his parents in the city of Cochabamba in the Maica Central community.  He currently has three head of cattle.  He delivers their production to a business that makes different dairy products.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy a dairy cow.  Among his dreams and goals is to get more cattle because in the future he wants to have a large farm like his parents.

This school was founded in 2002 and has a population of 109 pupils and 10 paid teachers. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan this school is requesting from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise have not being able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.<P>\r\n\r\nMohamed A. K. (second from left) is a teacher at the school and head of this group. Mohamed is a 42-year-old, married, with 6 children \u2013 2 in secondary school and 4 in primary school. Mohamed was born in a village called Paki Masaboh about 5 miles away from Makeni city. He has been both a teacher and a businessman. He has taught for 15 years and has been in business for 30 years. He relies on the profit he makes out of his business to complement his monthly salary. Mohamed sells local produce like rice and palm oil (the most popular cooking oil).  With his share of the loan, he will travel to villages surrounding Makeni to buy palm oil and rice wholesale to sell in Makeni. <P>\r\n\r\n(Attached beneath are snapshots of members of this group who
