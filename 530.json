It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thanks to his parents Mirzokosim now has the opportunity to move forward as a farmer and he hopes to increase his agricultural products so that he can bring his loved ones a more promising life. Despite being a good agriculturalist and worker he needs help to move forward and improve his production. This is why he is asking for a loan, so that he can buy more of the seeds and fertilizers he needs, which are very expensive, but without them his production will not improve.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He plans to increase the variety of items he has available for customers to use in making this ever-popular delicacy. Esan is married and has four children. One of his goals for his business is to be able to help his children as he can.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started with a small room in her own home where she only worked in the afternoons. Now this small space is not enough to tend to all of her customers; for this reason, she has found it necessary to expand into a more comfortable location where she will be able to offer a better service and buy more equipment.

The community is distinguished for being full of ponds, there are ponds everywhere. The members of the group comment that the community is very big in territory and people, and for this reason it was divided into 3 localities a few years ago. Boreje 1st neighbourhood to which this group belongs, 2nd neighbourhood of Boreje, and Barrio el salto are the localities which were previously one. The members of the group are 7 women who work at home and at their businesses. Some of them raise chickens or sheep, and others have a grocery store. The people of this community of Boreje are very simple, respectful, and never refuse to greet anyone even if they don't know each other. The names of the 7 members are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.-Anatalia M. L., Mrs. Anatalia is 53 years old, raises chickens and has a grocery store.\r\n2.-Angelica S. M., is 35 years old and has a grocery store\r\n3.-Teresa F. Gonzalez, is 41 years old and raises chickens\r\n4.-Ma Julia S. S., is 40 years old and raises sheep\r\n5.-Maria Catalina A. Marquuez, is 65 years old and raises sheep\r\n6.-Florentina C. C., is 31 years old and has a mobile phone business\r\n7.-Maribel S. C., is 25 years old and raises sheep\r\n\r\nThe 7 women have known each other for a long time. Some of them are next-door neighbours, and others live a little farther away but they see each other daily. The members decided to call themselves by this name because they had chosen other names but they were all taken by other groups. They therefore chose the name of their community, and that's how this name was settled on. Mrs. Anatalia became the representative of this group and she tells us her story.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anatalia is married, currently raises chickens, and in her house she has opened a curtain to be able to sell soft drinks, snacks, and canned goods - a general store, in fact. Her children no longer live with her. She had 5 children; 2 have already married, 1 daughter is in a relationship, and two more work in Mexico city. They visit her every 8 or 15 days, depending. In her house are only herself and her husband, and what she earns is for the two of them. About her business she says that the chickens are no difficulty for her since she has experience taking care of animals. What worries her is the store, there are times when she gets discouraged because there are no sales, there are things that don't sell, and other days sell more or less. As the sales are low, there are no earnings and no more money to invest. What you sell is what you invest. She is requesting this loan to be able to invest more and sell more, so that people see the store full and can choose what they want to buy. Mrs. Anatalia's dream is to start selling fruit and vegetables because no one sells fruit and vegetables and she believes that it could be good in her business. Mrs. Anatalia's husband is a builder and only works when he can be contracted as well as in the countryside.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":691843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy chickens and invest in a grocery store\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-17T17:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anatalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3007.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430841,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6014.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850094,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6014.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292368,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6014.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160626,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3007.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233504,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-17T20:08:19Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265769,"name":"Rosana Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosana reside en Usulut\u00e1n en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su madre, ella tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a la venta de hortalizas, verduras y frutas; este negocio lo administra desde hace 5 a\u00f1os su madre le ayuda a atender a los clientes.\nElla est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mercader\u00eda como Frutas, manzanas, melones, uvas tambi\u00e9n verduras y hortalizas como, papas, tomates, ejotes, pepinos, lechuga entre otras, ya que ella no cuenta con capital para aportarle al negocio, este pr\u00e9stamo le ayudara a mantener buenos niveles de producci\u00f3n al alcance de los clientes, mejorando su condici\u00f3n de comerciante.\nEl objetivo de Rosana es trabajar cada d\u00eda en busca de ingresos para ayudar a su madre  cubriendo sus necesidades y a la vez viendo por los gastos del hogar.\n","en":"Rosana lives in Usulutan with her mother.

It is a group made up of 9 people; 8 women and 1 man. The group is located in the La Purisima Concepcion Mayorasgo community. The people of this community are very humble and unassuming, but very thoughtful and hard-working. The members named their group \"Rosa de Castilla\" [\"Spanish Rose\"] because they say that it is a very beautiful flower and they wanted this name for their group. The members knew each other before; they say that they had formed this group before, but separated and later formed it again. They have been neighbours and friends in this community since they were children. For this reason, they get along very well. Whenever they meet for the payments, each member brings something to eat. The names of the nine people are the following:\r\n\r\n1.-Maria Herminia C. Garc\u00eda, age 61, raises chickens and lambs\r\n2.-Emiliana P. S., age 45, raises lambs\r\n3.-Ma Ines C. R., age 49, raises chickens\r\n4.-Isidro T. P., age 24, has a grocery store\r\n5.-Epifania S. O., age 53, raises lambs\r\n6.-Regina T. C., age 34, raises chickens\r\n7.-Claudia C. C., age 46, raises lambs\r\n8.-Juana C. R., age 44, raises lambs\r\n9.-Josefina Bernal R., age 27, raises lambs and chickens.\r\n\r\nMrs Josefina is in charge of the group. She proposed the group's name and was also the person who looked for people to join the Rosa de Castilla group. She is 27, married, and has lived with her husband in a borrowed home for 7 years. The house belongs to her parents-in-law, so she wants her own home, even though she is young, in order to live more comfortably. She has 3 dependent children; 2 girls who are in preschool and a baby. Her husband works as a carpenter but does not earn enough for them to live more comfortably. For this reason, Mrs Josefina helps him to raise the lambs in order to get everything out of the business and support their children. Josefina raises the animals and her husband sells them. This is how they work together. Josefina tells us that she suffers a bit taking care of the animals, but thanks to God her animals are multiplying and she has many. Taking care of them is a bit difficult since she has to buy the hay, as they do not plant it. Part of Josefina's goals are to build her home, and to be able to have everything necessary to do so. At the moment her daughters are small, but when they are older Josefina is thinking of looking for a job to cover the things that they currently do not have.

Mrs Irma, in order to help her children in school, sells her chickens and turkeys. She gives her earnings to her children so that they can keep studying--so this loan will benefit her family.

With this loan, she hopes to please her clients and attract their attention so that they can buy from her and generate income for her.\r\n<p>\r\nAna Lucia is motivated to continue working to strengthen her business every day, to provide her children with what they need, and for them to study to succeed in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":694487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of jeans, blouses, shirts, pants, shorts, and underwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Nueva Guadalupe, San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2011-01-17T20:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":46.14},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":49.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.42},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.46,"local_amount":34.46,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900697,"comment":null},{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":37.61,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":37.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201340043,"comment":null},{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":37.28,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":37.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209992,"comment":null},{"amount":37.56,"local_amount":37.56,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:49:33Z","rounded_local_amount":37.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211285257,"comment":null},{"amount":40.14,"local_amount":40.14,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216565308,"comment":null},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":40.58,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":40.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105313,"comment":null},{"amount":272.37,"local_amount":272.37,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":272.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263407427,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-17T22:57:00Z","paid_date":"2012-03-16T08:31:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265809,"name":"Kosar Sajid Ali's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kosar lives in Kamoki, which is a small city in Punjab, Pakistan, famous for its agricultural industry.

The name comes from the actual place where the members of  the group meet, which happens to be the business site belonging to Mrs. Claudia C. C., who acts as the representative for her colleagues.  The meetings take place outside where the rising sun can be seen every morning.\r\n\r\nIn this narrative we will talk about Martha Iris Nicol\u00e1s Ram\u00edrez who is 31 years old and the mother of four children.  Her husband is 29 years old and is a bricklayer.  Her small children are Denis, who is 13 years old and in the 6th grade, Axel who is 11 and in 5th grade, Irais who is 8 and Jes\u00fas who is 3 years old.  Martha has been making and selling crafts for over a year.  Before she worked in a store and didn't have enough time to look after her children the way she wanted to but with her current job she can.  Martha sells all kinds of articles for children's parties and events.  She sells pi\u00f1atas, toys, baby clothes and souvenirs.\r\n\r\nMartha became a member of the group so she could request a loan to buy more items and materials for her business, such as pi\u00f1atas, baby bottles, pacifiers, rattles, baby caps, dolls, doll buggies, photo frames, tea sets for little girls, action figures, diaper bags, balls and materials for handicrafts and souvenirs.  Martha's business is doing well and sales increased in December thanks to the traditional nativity scenes and celebrations carried out in the town.  Also there was more activity around the Epiphany dates as parents were buying toys for children.  Martha usually stocks her business depending on the season and on customer demand.\r\n\r\nMartha uses her earnings to buy more goods and to pay back her loan.  Her business has improved greatly.\r\n\r\nOne of Martha's big dreams is to expand her business, make improvements in merchandise, and hire someone to help her out with customer service.  She also wants to buy her own home since she now lives with her in-laws.\r\n\r\nMartha hopes to see her children grow into good citizens who help others in need.  She wants to see them happy and nurtured in love and affection, growing up in a healthy, harmonious atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThanks to Kiva these dreams can come true; and thanks to institutions like the Foundation, those who have less can receive a gesture of support and service.  The women from the Oaxaca coast feel supported by this great team.\r\n\r\nThe \"Frente al sol\" group is comprised of 10 ladies who work very hard to carve out a future for their children.  They are responsible, hard-working women who are very committed to their families and society.  These are the names of each member of the group and their individual activity.\r\n\r\nClaudia C.

They began with two machines and currently have seven.  \n\nAs a second job, Emiliana works in transcription, as it is another form of income to be able to pay her debts.  The loan that they requested is to be able to purchase a photocopier since her brother has an internet caf\u00e9 and many people ask if they photocopy there.  Seeing the demand of the people that live in the area, they made the decision to purchase a photocopying machine to have another source of income to be able to survive.  They are very appreciative of the loan granted.\t\t\t\n\nEmiliana is pictured in her sewing workshop.\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":694671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of

Sarina R., 36, certainly values the same thing, not just in terms of her house and her community, but in her life as well. Sarina reached only high school, but she does not give up opportunities to set her life straight. She is married to Roger, and together they raise their children, who are now in high school. They live together in Bagong Silang, Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nSarina co-manages a junk shop with her husband. They work together to help with the cleanliness of the community by recycling junk materials into something reusable. Also, they have a tricycle which they rent out to drivers daily. Their family income ranges around 300 PHP daily out of their business.\r\n\r\nTo help her with her business, Sarina applied for a loan of 20,000 PHP. She plans to use this money to help her grow her junk shop. She says that she would like to buy additional equipment for recycling. She also needs to buy essential materials for the junk shop, such as metal and galvanized corrugated metal roofing.\r\n\r\nSarina admits that she is frequently tired and appears dirty because of the nature of her work in the junk shop. However, she believes that her business is doing a lot to help her community. It is also in Sarina's heart to help other people in many more ways other than community waste management. But the people who she desires to help the most are her children. \r\n\r\nSarina wants to be able to send her children to school up until college and give them a good future. She faithfully meets up with other CCT members by attending a fellowship* meeting every week.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":694885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Waste Management","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase essential materials for the junk shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-18T04:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":7032.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396064,"comment":null},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5625.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814173,"comment":null},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7032.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256738,"comment":null},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333.38,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1406.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-18T06:40:11Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265949,"name":"Soam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soam K., 44, is married and resides with her husband and a child in Takeo Province, Cambodia, an area known for pre-Angkorian temples.

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling animal feed and farm-related products for pigs and chickens in the local community. Myra has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Myra joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myra has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as working capital and to purchase additional inventory. Myra is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, like pig and chicken feed. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Myra from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She lives there in the area named Kot Nihal Singh with her family in a 2-room brick house. She moved here 9 years ago. She is 35 years old and married to H. M. who works in a government organization for a low income. \r\n\r\nShameem supports her family by doing sewing work. She does the work according to orders which she receives from neighborhood clients. She has a good number of clients due to her quality of work. She uses the income in paying their utility bills and the school fees for her children. \r\n\r\nShameem is the mother of five sons. Three of them are enrolled in a local school and getting their education. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to further improve her business of sewing. She will use the loan money in buying a new sewing machine because her previous machine has become old and is not producing a quality work. The new machine will help her finish orders on time so she receives more orders every month.

Hajii has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. Hajii is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand beauty parlor services. This will be the third loan taken out by Hajii from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand his business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. lives in the village of Eastern Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 21 years old, single and makes a living by running a shop that sells ready-to-wear and ukay-ukay (or used) clothing. She has been in this business for more than three years and earns about 10,000 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nLast year, Lalyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI and is applying for a new one, for 8,000 PHP, to buy more used clothing to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by her business to continue expanding it. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Poblcaion 2, Banisilan, South Cotabato. She is 58 years old. Rosie is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Rosie owns & operates a business venture making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making and selling specialty food like \"arrozcaldo\" or chicken porridge in the local community. Rosie has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Rosie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosie is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make specialty foods like \"arrozcaldo\". This will be the 1st loan taken out by Rosie from HSPFI.
