She is married to Renante, her business partner, and is a mother to three children. The eldest child is already in college while the youngest is still in elementary school. She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGirlie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also retails rice & electronic cell phone loading. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 550 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGirlie hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":880832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Starting with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Sovetkan was able to develop her business to yield a monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS) and to buy a barn and a house on the outskirts of the village.  This location became convenient for feeding livestock and selling milk and meat products.  In order to further grow her business, Sovetkan requested a loan in the sum of 55,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.

1956.  She lives in the Achajur village together with her family.  Margo is married and has two children.  Her daughter is married and lives separately from the parents, and her son and husband periodically travel for seasonal work to Russia.  Margo has been working as an accountant at the village school for 36 years and has been involved in agriculture parallel to her work.  Previously, her husband used to help her with the business, and they bred cattle, but because her husband often leaves now, she started to breed only chickens.

Anait's daughter attends a school, her son is 5 years old, and her husband and father-in-law work as drivers.  Anait works at the town administrative office and makes window drapes to-order at home after work.  Her mother-in-law helps her with the sewing, and together they fill not only individual orders, but orders from small hotels and restaurants.  Anait says that they always have many orders, and they often work nights.  Thanks to this business, Anait and her mother-in-law are able to provide for the family's basic needs because a driver's salary is not enough to support the family.  Anait needs a loan in the sum of 850,000 dram for the purchase of materials and various accessories for filling her

But he is happy to be able to support his three children who he educates and raises in their own house in the town of San Pedro de Cajas.  Ever since he was a boy he has been involved in handicrafts and says it is what he enjoys most in every regard.  He works with different art techniques such as oil painting and stone sculptures.  That's why his colleagues call him \"multiple\", because he is: a craftsman, sculptor, painter and even a farmer.  He claims he has been doing this for 21 years.  His main woven products are tapestries depicting landscapes.  He also makes wooden spoons, Huislash (sculptures) and now is going into the line of sheep's wool shawls, which is quite successful.  For a while now he has been processing the required paperwork to set up a textile company so he can export his products and take them around to different fairs in the country.  He knows it will be a long road but he will work hard for his dream.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Telarmachay\" and this is his seventh loan through MFP.  He is respected by the members there since he is the founder of the bank, and very proud of it.  He is punctual about paying back the loans.

He lives with his parents in their own home, located in San Pedro de Cajas. He spends the best part of the year in the city of Huancayo where he is studying chemical engineering. He is very close to completing his studies and becoming a professional. However, for years he has been generating his own income. He weaves rugs, carpets and chair covers which he sells in the city of Cerro de Pasco, where the cold is intense and the demand for his products high. In all this time he has managed to acquire 5 looms with which he practices his craft. He never rests, being active is his principal virtue, as from Monday to Friday he studies while at weekends he continues with his weaving business. In addition to all of this, he also breeds guinea pigs; up until now he has 100 exemplars and in the future he wants to improve the farm with pure bred stock so as to increase the profits he makes from the partneship he belongs to. He is a member of the communal bank \"San Pedro de Cajas\" and this is his second loan with MFP. He hopes that you will all support him so he can achieve his goal.

She lives in the town of La Vega in the Santa Barbara department.  She works selling merchandise.\r\n\r\nMery began selling clothing for children and adults as a street vendor.  She did this for twelve years, until 2003, when she was able to obtain her own store.  She learned from one of her cousins and now works on her own.  She serves customers from 8:00am until 8:00pm.  To purchase the merchandise she sells in her small store, she travels to the city of San Pedro Sula because she gets good prices there and she can then offer her customers lower prices.  Once in a while she is not able to recover money for goods bought on credit, but in spite of this, she continues ahead.\r\n\r\nMery is asking for this loan to purchase merchandise such as shoes, clothing for adults and children, sandals, cosmetics, and other products.

She has run a bakery for four years. It is well known as Jacqueline makes the best bread in the area as well as a variety of sweet and savoury items: alfajores, croissants, scones, semitas (tart of bread dough filled with jam), fruit tarts etc. The bakery is located in a busy street where many passers by are regular customers because of her excellent baking and low prices. \r\n\r\nJacqueline starts work at 4am daily when she bakes French loaves ready for a delivery person to take them to stores and regular clients near her home. In short, she is an enterprising person, inspired by her elderly mother who can no longer work because of her age. She truly enjoys her work.\r\n\r\nShe hopes one day to be able to afford to take a course or some training in bread-making so that she can improve her products.

Although he is very young, Oscar has worked hard to get ahead and from a very early age began working on a coffee plantation where he learned all about growing coffee.  His economic situation changed as soon as he got married since his father-in-law gave him his own patch of land.  Oscar began growing coffee and now also grows malanga.  He has no hired help so he is the only one who cares for the crops, which he does every day from very early in the morning.

Molek in her business.  Kiva's line of credit, given to Molek for her animal husbandry business, was repaid without delays.  Molek was born in the Chaldovar village (Panfilovsk district, Chuysk region, Kyrgyz republic).  She is 53 years old and a widow.  She is raising three sons - oldest Sulayman, middle Shamil and youngest Sultan, and all of them live in the Rovnoe village, in their own house.  Molek was the fourth child in a large, low-income family.  Since young age, she had to help her mother with the household, and this is why she only completed 7 grades of a secondary school and did not have the opportunity to finish her education.  Also since young age, Molek went to work as a dairymaid at a collective farm and was involved in raising and educating her children after she was married.  When Molek's husband passed away, it was difficult for the family, and the children and she suffered through the loss of their father and husband.  Molek started to pull the strap for two.  She had a large responsibility on her shoulders, and put all of her efforts toward developing the animal husbandry business, that she started together with her husband.  At that moment, she had 15 heads of sheep and one cow, and the sales of milk and dairy products was the source of income.  Molek's children helped her with everything by taking cattle to pasture and working as shepherds parallel to this.  This is how the entire family was involved in animal husbandry.  Currently, Molek's business includes three dairy cows, one bull, one horse and 22 heads of sheep.  To further develop her business, Molek requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" company in order to purchase ewes.  She plans to repair her barn and increase livestock headcount."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":882128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase ewes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Rovnoe village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Molek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-13T03:32:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":340925,"name":"Akram","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0432. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 36 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0410\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041f\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0438. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432.

","en":"Kulsara is 43 years old, married and has four children. Kulsara's family has been farming and raising livestock since 1992. Starting with the sum of 13,500 som (KGS) Kulsara has been able to expand her herd, which now has four cows and two calves and yields a profit of 7,000 som monthly. An additional source of income this year will also be a three acre plot of potatoes of land which Kulsara is planning to sell in May\/July of next year. To further develop her livestock business, Kulsara has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase four more calves for fattening and sale. Kulsara is planning to use the profits from the loan to build a new modern barn for her animals.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":882431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Korumdu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulsara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":787.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":40545,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722501,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-11T14:46:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341017,"name":"Abdalla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdalla is a married man with three school going children, they live in a rental house that has electricity and piped water.

The official name of this borrowing group is N. X\u00e1 nh\u00f3m 19 (19).\r\n\r\nHuy\u00ean is married and has three school-age children. To making a living, Huy\u00ean owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising rabbits for sale. Huy\u00ean has been engaged in this business for more than five years and earns approximately 4,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Huy\u00ean joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Huy\u00ean has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and resell. She is now requesting a new loan of 7,392,000 VND, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  \r\n\r\nHuy\u00ean plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.

He is married and is raising a son. \r\n\r\nTaalaybek was one of the eight children born to a simple farming family, he was the youngest son. His father was running a small farming business and as a child Taalaybek was helping him with livestock and dreaming about having his own herd in the future. After finishing high school Taalaybek served in the army in Siberia. In 1985, after serving two years, Taalaybek returned to his home village and started an apprenticeship to become a tractor driver, then took a job in the local kolhoz as a tractor-harverster driver. \r\n\r\nAfter two years, in 1987 Taalaybek married. After the wedding Taalaybek started living with his parents as is customary among the Kyrgyz, where the youngest son lives with his parents and takes care of their health. While working for the kolhoz and earning salary, Taalaybek was buying calves for his family's herd. After a year of marriage Taalaybek and his wife welcomed a daughter. Taalaybek was always working for the kolhoz and taking care of the family's farm in his spare time. In 1994 Taalaybek's father passed away. In 2004 Taalaybek's daughter got married and in the same year two more events happened - Taalaybeks' mother passed away and his wife gave birth to a son. All of these events had adversely affected the family's financial situation. From the kolhoz Taalaybek received 10 acres of land where he now grows oats and clover. \r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2010 Taalaybek sold two of his dairy cows and used the money to purchase sugar beets and sell them to the sugar factory. This business turned out to be lucrative and in the future Taalyabek is planning to purchase sugar beets annually and sell them when the prices for beets increase. In this way, Taalaybek is doing his best to feed his family and currently, due to his dedication and hard work the family's well off financially. Taalaybeks' herd has 20 cows and he used to have five calves which he sold to purchase a VW Golf. Now, in his spare time he also offers taxi services in his village. In order to further expand his business initiatives, Taalaybek has turned to \"Bai-Tushun and partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase more sugar beets. By storing the sugar beets until spring, when supply is low, Taalaybek is planning to sell the beets at a better price. Profits from the loan Taalaybek is planning to invest into purchasing more cattle and in the future he is hoping to build a bigger house for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":445,"image":{"id":882469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Telman village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Taalaybek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":445},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1001.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":445,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":20047.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125432,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-21T01:39:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341036,"name":"Mahmoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahmoud is from Iraq.

She has a husband and another son in the United States who occasionally send a little money so that they can carry on surviving. However, this is not a fixed income as her husband does not have permanent employ in the States and only sends remittances when he can. Rina is not a woman who sits and waits. Three years ago she decided to open a small shop thanks to her husband's economic contributions. Here she sells a variety of staple products.
