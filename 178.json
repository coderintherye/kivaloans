With this loan she wants to buy; 400 kg of smoked fish to be purchased at Mopti and resold in Fana for cash or credit. She will sell  in either wholesale or retail lots, to a clientele of both men and women.\r\n\r\nWhen she travels to Mopti to replenish her provisions, she buys honey in Fana to be resold for cash to the wholesales in Mopti. This allows her to carry less cash during the trip and also diversifies her business activity to earn additional profit.

She has been in business off and on since 1981. She started by selling rolled cotton. Her beginning capital was US$ 7. Her first business prospered but lasted only for six months due to the lack of goods on the market. \r\n\r\nMonique had to change businesses. She started selling rice and soaps at the market, but was severely impacted when the Congolese Franc lost its value in 1981. She lost all of her capital and went to take care of her family until 2003.\r\n\r\nMonique launched another business in 2003. She started selling beverages, cakes and waffles until 2007 when she joined one of Hope\u2019s groups called \u201cLoboko\u201d meaning \u201cHand\u201d in English. Through her sales, Monique makes about US$ 70 per week. Monique plans to use her loan from Hope to diversify her business and sell salted and smoked fish and mushrooms. In order to increase her income, Monique has various points of sale within her community. She dreams one day of putting up a large business building that she can rent out for additional income.  \r\n\r\nMonique is 64 years old, married, and a mother of twelve children between the ages of 22 and 46; two of her children are sick and stay with her. The rest of her children are independent. In spite of her age, Monique likes selling because it gives her the opportunity to make contact with many different people, and once they become permanent customers, she is able to offer them quality products at a better price and they keep coming back.

The purpose of her business is to expand it since her location is at the market of Chichigalpa. She has owned this business for over 9 years and she started it by selling clothing and cosmetics. But later on she started selling basic food items like, rice, oil, beans, sugar and fruits. With the loans she has previously received she has been able to expand her business, and now she needs a loan to buy more products to sell.  She will then be able to  satisfy her customers even more. Rosa's biggest dream is that people in developed countries will continue giving the necessary help to people in underdeveloped countries.

A. is already 70 years old; but despite the age, she is still strong and able to do business in the community. Teresita is a seamstress and has become quite popular making good clothes for all her clients. People come to her house for their dress needs especially wedding and party dresses. Teresita has eight children and is already a widow. One thing she is happy about, however, is that all her children were raised with good values and high morals. She forgets when exactly she started her tailoring business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Pili M. is from Mbeya. She is 49 years old and married with seven children ranging from ages 24 to 31. Pili has been running a kuku business since 1997. \r\n\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are 'kuku,' you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space. So sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing, they produce eggs which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (Maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n \r\nPili works at the business for nine hours per day, seven days per week. She currently earns about $250 a month from her business. Pili is now requesting a loan of $375 in order to purchase feeds and to afford treatment expenses for her chickens. In the future, she plans to increase the number of chickens in her project. Pili thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed \"non-creditworthy\" by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

(Greetings!) from Tanzania!

Her business is purchasing basic home commodities and reselling them.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business 9 hours per day, and 6 days per week. Sauda currently earns about $120 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 525 USD in order to purchase items like sugar, soap, rice, and other basic home needs to sell in her shop.

Sauda graciously thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":270898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":270902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing

This is 28 years old Frola M. from Mbeya. She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 4 and 14.  \r\n\r\nFrola has been selling used bedsheets since 2002. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam. Retailers then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything western or modern. Some argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress; however, the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nFrola works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband.  Frola currently earns about 50USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375USD in order to increase the stock of used bed sheets in bulk. In the future, she plans to open another business. Flora thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

The goods are gotten at the Kenekou marketplace from wholesalers and are resold in and around the village of Sirimou. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, the women each intend to obtain a profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be used to increase their working capital.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neh  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madjata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paya  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.66,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":67735.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135850,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033646,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621014,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019979,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242724,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T18:12:51Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88785,"name":"Le Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Li\u00ean n\u0103m nay 45 tu\u1ed5i,  ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb kh\u00f4ng may m\u1ea5t s\u1edbm, hi\u1ec7n ch\u1ecb \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng 2 con  t\u1ea1i huy\u1ec7n Kim \u0110\u1ed9ng t\u1ec9nh H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean.

They form the group Kelenya and live in traditional extended conjugal families with sisters, brothers, children, and spouses in the village of Sirimou (Kenekou sub-prefecture, part of Koulikoro prefecture) in the Koulikoro region of the Republic of Mali.  They know one another by ties of community and commerce, and for the most part they do commerce in <i>karit\u00e9<\/i> butter. \r\n<p>\r\nTo develop their income-generating work, they joined the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are on their fifth group loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. The women plan to buy a tonne of <i>karit\u00e9<\/i> butter from their fellow retailers in town, so as to sell the butter retail, cash or credit accepted, to wholesalers from Fana.  Customers are composed of men and women.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each hope to obtain a profit of 35,000 francs CFA at the end of the cycle.

This is 33 year old Lucy K. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with one child, who is 33 years old. Lucy has been running a milling machine business since 2007. Milling machines are used to grind up grains (maize) to get flour. She does this both for her customers and for herself. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Lucy currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more maize. In the future, she plans to buy another milling machine. Lucy thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":270986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tolib is 48 years old and lives in Istaravshan town with his wife works as a shopkeeper to help with the living expenses.Tolib has four sons who also help him. For thirty years Tolib has worked his land which produces potato, tomato and cucumber. His greatest dream is to be able to establish more crops to that he can leave equal parts to his children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

devotes herself to the production of vegetables. For this reason she remains as long as possible on her lands, dedicating herself to the care and fertilizations of her fields: with all this effort it is possible to obtain a good harvest and sell the products, with the aim of offering her two children an education and personal development appropriate to their age. \r\n\r\nHidoyat is thinking of opening a grocery store in her house to increase her family's income. This requires investment, so Hidoyat is asking for your help to purchase a larger quantity of manure and fertilizer.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to tmhe 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Blandina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":271042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

A.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania! Pictured here is 50 year-old Neema S. from Mbeya. She is married with seven children who are between the ages of 13 and 30. \r\n\r\nNeema has been running a mgahawa business [local restaurant] since 2008. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to visit. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantains (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Neema currently earns about 96USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 300USD in order to renovate a her business place. In the future, she plans to start a new business. Neema thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":271045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To renovate her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-14T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema A.

Before moving to Kinshasa, he taught in the Equator province in the DRCongo.  In 1987 he started his first business with a working capital of US$ 15. He was selling sugar, salt, soaps, toilet paper, candles, matches and so on in his village. From 1987 to 1997, his business was prosperous and he increased his working capital to US$ 400. \r\n\r\nFrom 1997 to 2000, the Equator province was invaded by the war from eastern Congo, and people were forced to leave their homes. He and his family moved to Mbandaka, the main town of the province. From 2000 to 2003, he continued running his business there with restriction due to the war. In 2004 he fell sick and was very often hospitalized for almost a year. He suffered from malaria and bronchitis. He used almost all of his business working capital for medical care. \r\n\r\nAfter recovering, Ferdinand decided to change his business and started to sell lamp oil in 2005 once again with a working capital of US$ 15. He worked very hard, and with good management he increased his working capital to US$ 300 in 2007. After learning through a friend about Hope\u2019s loan program, he decided to join one of its groups in the same year. \r\n\r\nFerdinand has already received five loans from Hope that he repaid correctly. With his next loan he plans to extend his business by adding others items such as bracelets and earrings. His dream is to purchase second-hand appliances from Europe and sell them in Kinshasa. Ferdinand is 52 years old and a father of 5 children between the ages 13 and 27 of whom four go to school and the oldest is independent. Ferdinand runs his business in the northeastern part of Kinshasa.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":269031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Mado runs a cement store and also sells 10kg sacks of corn flour. She has been in business since 1994. She began her business with US$ 60, selling palm oil from 1994 to 1995. In 1996, her business slowed down because of the deterioration of her health. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, Mado decided to change her business by starting to sell rice, semolina and vegetable oil. Most of her working capital was focused on semolina because of the profit it was generating. Unfortunately, in 1999 many companies closed in DRCongo due to the war and insecurity, including those that were producing Mado\u2019s goods. So her business regressed until 2007 when she re-launched it, offering new types of products. She began selling women\u2019s slippers, vegetable oil, and corn flour. \r\n\r\nAfter learning through her friend about Hope\u2019s loan program, she decided to join one of its groups in May 2008. Mado has already received two loans from Hope that she repaid correctly. Currently, her working capital is about $170. With her next loan she is planning to purchase 28 10kg sacks of corn flour to increase the inventory of her business. Mado\u2019s dream is to do corn and manioc farming and be a provider of those products in her area. She runs her business in the northern and most populated area of Kinshasa.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":269043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

William is very popular in his area because of his hard work and his dedication to work. He is a commercial taxi driver and also sells food items like maize. He has been in this business for over two years now. William said he started this business when demands for maize became very high in the surrounding communities. William buys his goods from the farmers in far away communities and retails to food vendors and treks the remaining to the big cities. He is also a taxi driver but, for now, he drives someone else's car. He is looking forward to buying his own car when business progresses. William wants a loan to increase his working capital so that his dream of buying his own car and goods in bulk can be achieved. In this way, he can supply to a large number of customers to increase his market size and his profit margin.\r\n\r\nWilliam belongs to a group called \u2018Nyame Akwan\u2019 which  means God\u2019s way.

Pictured here is 36 years old Tatu M. from Mbeya. She is married with three children who are between the ages of three and 10. \r\n\r\nTatu has been running a business selling used clothes since 1997. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers. These retailers then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost. Furthermore, western or modern clothing is becoming more appealing Some argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee and one family member. Tatu currently earns about 60USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375USD in order to purchase more used clothes in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of clothes and to open another business. Tatu thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more used clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Tatu N.

Eliza thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more beers such as Kilimanjaro, tusker, safari lager, the kick, reds, Bavaria and Serengeti","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130776,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027565,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613566,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010645,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232931,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664724,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105448,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022593,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867842,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757043,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T16:58:19Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88884,"name":"Bachar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bachar, 33, lives in Bourj El Barajneh, in the southern suburbs of Lebanon, with his wife and their two children.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! Pictured here is 32-year old Cresensia O. from Mwanza. She is married with three children who are between the ages of three and 10. Additionally, she is also mother to one orphan.\r\n\r\nCresensia has been running a furniture business since 2007. She sells beds, chairs and tables. She works at the business for eight hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. Cresensia currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy 40 pieces of timber so that she can continue to make furniture. In the future, she plans to increase her timber stock. Cresensia thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy pieces of timber to make furniture for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cresensia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130777,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027566,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613567,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010646,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232932,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664725,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105449,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022594,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867843,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757044,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T05:17:02Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88887,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 55 year old man who lives in the Bekaa with his wife and their seven children. \r\nAli has been working as a mason for twenty years and he has requested a loan of 1000 US dollars from Al Majmoua in order to purchase tools.

Pictured here is 27 year-old Veronica M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children who are between the ages of one and four. Additionally, she is is mother to one orphan.\r\n\r\nVeronica has been running a tailoring business since 2006. She sells clothes mainly for women. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, five days per week and is assisted by her husband. Veronica currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. \r\n\r\nNow, she is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print) and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides). She plans to use these materials to design clothing mainly for women. In the future, she plans to increase her stocks. Veronica thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) to make them into women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130778,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027567,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613568,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010647,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232933,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664726,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105450,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022595,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867844,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T04:22:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88890,"name":"Irina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irina is single.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":271106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

Mary thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Rose thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy additional stocks of soda, sugar, wheat flours and fitness books","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130781,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027570,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613571,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010650,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232936,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T04:40:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88901,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 25 year old man who lives in the Bekaa.

She rents a home from her aunt and wants to make improvements to her business.  With her young children by her side, Beatriz creates her beautiful handcrafted weavings which she sells to a middleman who later sells them in the Tupac Amaru market (an important marketplace in the city of Juliaca).  Beatriz very much enjoys weaving which is why she always makes original weavings even though not all weaving is easy.  Because she finds it difficult to always be weaving \"chullos\" (a typical Andean hat) which are the items which sell best to tourists, she is thinking that it would be best for the future of her business if she were to open her own store where she could sell her weavings herself.  Her wish is to give her children a good education and give them what her parents were not in a position to give her.  This is Beatriz' second loan with MFP, but it is her first as part of her current community bank.  She is prepared to make her repayments on time so that she doesn't hurt her reputation and so as not to create problems for her fellow members.

He would like to increase his earnings in order to give his mother a better quality of life.  With the help of his mother, Edgar makes handmade textiles, which he sells at his small store at the market.  The hardest part is transporting the merchandise to the store but he realizes that it is part of the work.  He really enjoys weaving, even more so if it is handicraft.

Ynes has lived in extreme poverty her whole life, and decided a few years back that she wanted to change her future and the future of her family. She received her first loan from Esperanza International and started a small salon from her house. From there she kept working hard and kept increasing the services and products of her salon, and today she has a very successful business. She can finally afford to pay for all of life's basic necessities, and even some luxuries. She has never been happier than she is now, and feels like she can beat poverty.

She rents a room which she shares with her sister.  Every weekend she travels from Juliaca to the city of Moquegua to sell her crafts at the Sunday market.  This trip is both very difficult and tiring but she knows she must make it to sell her products; she also enjoys offering her prized merchandise to passers-by.  She has been in this business for 12 years: it is very profitable as she is the only one selling pots, plates and other clay kitchen utensils.  She does not only sell in Moquegua as from Monday to Friday, she also sells at the markets of Juliaca.  Elba is very hard-working and wants to have her own craft store, which is why she works so very hard without rest.

This is 30 year old Zena M. from Mbeya. She is married with three  children, between the ages of 9 and 15. Zena has been running a clothes business since 1997. She purchases and resells clothing.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9 hours per day, 6 days per week. Zena currently earns about 250USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 750USD in order to purchase more clothes in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to start a new business. Zena thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":271538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing cosmetics in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mwajuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130785,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027574,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613575,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010654,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232940,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664732,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T16:34:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89019,"name":"Sarn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sarn K. is a 40-year-old widow and she lives in Trapaing Pring village in Kampong Chhnang province.

The women plan to use this loan to buy sacks of beans, boxes of macaroni, drums of cooking oil, and various condiments for food catering purposes.  The food is sold at night, in front of the door of their house, and in the morning at an early hour.

The women plan to use this loan to buy Wax-brand <i>pagnes<\/i> cloth and embroidered ones in Lom\u00e9 and in Cotonou, plus a sizable quantity of cosmetics in Bamako (the capital of Mali).  The <i>pagnes<\/i> and cosmetics are sold retail, cash or credit accepted, at the Koutiala marketplace and going door-to-door.  Their customers are women.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average profit of 110,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  These funds will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in their work.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans

She purchases clothes from wholesale businesses and sells them at retail. \n\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by four employees. Eliza currently earns about US$200 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of US$700 to purchase more clothes in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open another business. Eliza thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":271589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":271599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To stock

Ritha has been running a poultry business since 2003. \r\n\r\nKuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, seven days per week. Ritha currently earns about US$300 from her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to expand her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This is 50-year-old Farida U. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with five children between the ages of 13 and 25. Farida has been running a poultry business since 1990. \r\n\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for six hours per day, seven days per week. Farida currently earns about US$300 from her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to open another business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and the loving mother of 4 children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. Now she dedicates herself to raising and selling cows and sheep and with the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. \n\nShoira is asking for a loan of 800 USD in order to buy more calves to sell when they are fully grown. With this investment she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal!\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and the father of two children, E. Abduvali was born on August 03, 1973 in Spitamen district of Sugd region. Coming from an area where cattle-raising is popular, Abduvali has been selling cattle since 1998. He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. Today he would like to expand his business by increasing his capital, so that he can then maximize his profits. For this reason, he is requesting this first loan to purchase young cattle. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":271636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

They will use the loan for various purposes. <p> \r\nMrs. Hei K. is the village bank president. She is 47 years old and sells firewood. She is the mother of nine children; two of whom are employed in a garment factory, three help their parents work, and the others attend the local school. Her husband, Mr. Vong Khorn, is a farmer who owns a piece of land to cultivate rice. Even though they try to work hard, they still do not have enough money to provide a better house for their family. Mrs. Hei K. is requesting a loan to add to her savings to build a better house. <p>\r\n\r\nMr.Vuthy S. is not participating in this loan, but his wife is, so she is shown in the photo instead of him. <p>\r\n\r\nNine members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was founded in 2003. Today, it has a total of 580 pupils (both female and male) with a staff of sixteen teachers. This Agricultural Secondary School is the only secondary school in the whole Kasonko Chiefdom. Once pupils graduate from the school (which is a Junior Secondary School \u2013 JSS), they then move to a senior secondary school in Kabala (twenty-five miles from Fadugu), which is the nearest  big town to Fadugu. Others go to other bigger towns like Makeni, Bo, Kenema, or Freetown. The school teaches mainly agriculture which is the primary occupation of the people of Fadugu. \n\nSince it is the only secondary school in the chiefdom, accommodating the pupils has become a problem for the school. The school lacks enough buildings to house the growing number of pupils within and around the whole chiefdom. Staffing too is another problem facing the school; almost all of the teachers in the school are unqualified. In addition to these problems, the library lacks the required textbooks.\n\n\nNotwithstanding these constraints facing the school, this secondary school prides itself on producing 100% passes at the Basic Education Examination (BECE) for the academic years of 2005 \u2013 2007. Though the school may lack trained and qualified teachers (since it is in a small town,; the few qualified and trained teachers in the country prefer teaching in bigger towns), it has determined, dedicated and willing teachers who are willing and ready to assist the children to make the grade. \n\nPatrick M. T. (left) is the Principal of the school. He has been in the teaching profession for thirty-one years.  He is fifty years of age, married with six children, all of whom are still in school.

This is 42-year-old Eva S. from Dar es Salaam. She is single with three children between the ages of 14 and 25. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because his parents cannot take care of him. \r\n\r\nEva has been running a poultry business since 2006. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\nFirst, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, seven days per week. Eva currently earns about US$500 from her business. She is requesting a loan to build a house for raising kuku. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Eva thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

S. is 20 years old. For about two years, Ehsonjon has been selling flowers. His sales point is located in the central flower market of the city and he works from the early morning till the late evening. Before this, he helped his mother with selling small things and then he decided to start his own business in order to help his mother with household expenses, since his father died 6 years ago. \n\nOver the years he has been working,  Ehsonjon became an expert in his business, knowing even how to keep the flowers safe during severe winter. The business is successful aand generating a stable income for his small family. Now he is requesting 800 USD for a term of 12 months. The loan will be spent to purchase flowers to sell. He thanks all for supporting him and promises to be precise in loan repayment. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The school always gets a 100% passes at the National Primary School Exams (BECE). It is also victorious in quiz and cultural competitions organized by N.G.Os like Cause Canada and CADO. In sport, they also always triumph over the other two primary schools in the town.<p>\r\n\r\nAs part of their constraints, D.C.E lacks sufficient latrines for the 535 pupils it has \u2013 they only have six pit holes. D.C.E. also lacks a good water well to serve the children of this school. The only water well they have dries up completely during the dry season. Accommodation is also another problem for the children of D.E.C. The building is too small to accommodate the 535 pupils. Staff of D.E.C are working hard to meet these challenges; they are currently seeking assistance from the various N.G.Os in Koinadugu district. Fortunately, they are very grateful to VDC (Village Development Partnership, an NGO of former American Peace Corps), who are currently constructing them a three class-room building, the first to benefit from VDC in the Koinadugu district.<p> \r\n\r\nJuliet C.

He is planning with the next loan to diversify his business and increase profit by adding purified water. Currently, his working capital is about $200. Jos\u00e9\u2019s business makes about $6 of profit per day. He is ambitious and dreams someday to open a small store. Jos\u00e9 is 43 years old, married, and has five children between the ages 2 and 10. Three of them are pupils. He also takes care of his younger brother who is still a student.

It was built by Nancy B. K. in 1981 to promote education in the Chiefdom of Kasonko. It has a total of ten staff and 400 pupils. St. Peters and Paul RC Fadugu is one of the three primary schools in Fadugu, a small town about twenty-five miles from Kabala.\r\n\r\nSt. Peters and Paul RC Fadugu makes good grades at the National Primary School Examination (BECE) every academic year. The school has been able to send many pupils to secondary schools in bigger towns.\r\n\r\nUntil Sabobu Education completes constructing them a new school building, they are in short of sufficient class rooms to house the 400 pupil they have.
