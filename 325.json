She lives in one of the few areas that has water, light, and sewage services.  Her father started the tire repair shop, and through much effort her siblings have been able to succeed with it.  Now, Shirley manages it. \r\n\r\nShirley buys large tires for $25.00, and sells them for $40.00.  She buys small tires for $6.00, and sells them for $12.00.  The difficulties she has are thieves when she transports the tires, and the landlord is bothered by the noise from the machines.  \r\n\r\nHer husband helps her with the household expenses.  He works installing marble in gated communities.  They do not have children.  But, in order to be able to have a larger family Shirley wants to be stable in a house and not rent one.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy more tires and pipes, 950, in order to expand her business.  In the future she would like to set up another tire repair shop.  In the distant future she would like to have a photography studio because Shirley knows this work.

His house is concrete.  He began his work history working as a locksmith.  There, he learned many things including welding skills.  Due to his family's low income, he has had to continue with this line of work. He works welding iron from 8am until 5pm.  He buys iron at $1,000 and sells it at $1500.  One of the difficult things about his job is transporting the iron.  Samuel is in a common-law relationship with his wife, who is a housewife.  They have three children, an 8-year-old and a 6-year-old, who are in public elementary school, and a 14-year-old, who is in public secondary school.  With the funding he will buy more iron in order to enlarge his business.  In the future, he would like to set up a different business so that he can have time to study his children and learn from them and also help to have better economic stability and health.<br

Six years ago she decided to set up a store in her home so that she could have time to spend with her two daughters.  She works from 8am until 9pm; her 13-year-old daughter helps her with the store.  Zhanny buys frozen treats at $0.30 and she sells them at $0.50 each; notebooks at $0.70 and sells them at $1.20 each and sweets at $0.10 that she sells at $0.15.  One of her obstacles is when she gets sick, although this is rare, she has to go on.  Her husband helps with household expenses; he's an ice-cream peddler, but even so her economic situation is unstable.  Her 4-year-old isn't in school yet and her 13-year-old is in private school, but on scholarship.  With the funding she wants to buy $300 worth of frozen treats and $200 worth of sweets.  Her goal for the future is to enlarge her business so that she can improve her house, which still needs lighting and fencing.

after converting a city bus to run on vegetable oil, he launched his own alternative fuel retail company at the tender age of 23, right after getting his engineering degree. Brian recognizes that alternative fuel methods, while in demand, are costly for the average consumer, and his idea was to sell affordable products to meet this demand.\r\n\r\nBrian started his business on Ebay (an online buying and selling organization), where it was very successful. In the summer of 2008, shortly after he began selling, world oil prices took off and Brian's business became wildly profitable. He now has three very busy employees and keeps costs down by ordering in bulk, so that he can keep shipping costs affordable for his customers. He's going to use this loan to purchase inventory so that he can stay ahead of the curve in meeting his customers\u2019 demands - as he says, \"if I run out, it's an emergency!\"\r\n\r\nAware of his participation in the \"green\" movement, Brian is convinced that renewable energy is \"the fuel of the future\" because \"unlike everything else, it won't run out at some point.\" Though Brian wants to stay on the cutting edge in terms of designing innovative renewable energy products, he always keeps an eye towards his customers and makes sure to continue offering the products they want. Brian hopes that one day, he can run a biodiesel station on the highway that will be affordable enough to entice the average driver away from the gas station.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8000,"image":{"id":448493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To

In the beginning, he was working very long hours, and the pay wasn't enough to justify keeping him away from his family for so long - in fact, he says, it wasn't even enough to support his family. That's when he had the idea to import handmade crafts from his home country and sell them in Miami. Pedro says that the accessories he imports were not well-known in Miami before he started importing them, but he has been successful in selling them. His wife chooses the inventory and gets the best deal possible, and he sells it to responsible distributors in Miami and other metro areas such as NY, LA, Houston, and Atlanta.<P>\r\n\r\nPedro will use this loan to increase his inventory, and he says that clients have requested more products that he does not have at the moment. He says the loan will also help him increase his inventory in preparation for increased demand during the holiday season. In the future, he hopes to start importing items from other countries, such as Peru and Mexico, directly from the local craftsmen and women who make them.<P>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<P>\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. <P>\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

She began the business with the aim of offering help to her husband, especially in these times of so many economic difficulties.  \r\n\r\nEsmeralda is applying for a loan because she wishes to stock her business by purchasing other products like shoes, more drinks, and canned goods, among other things that are greatly needed by her customers.  Esmeralda is eager to improve her sales because she wants to be able to give her children everything they need, something which is impossible to offer them with only the earnings of her husband.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva

For eight years, Ramona has struggled to get ahead with her business, which is the only source of income that she can count on since her oldest daughter lost her job, and it has been difficult for her to find a new one.

C.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda makes her living creating handicrafts (bags, fans, car seat covers, brooms, hats, rugs and worked pots).  They are products that she learned to make as a child along with raising barnyard animals (pigs, chickens, turkeys).  They use the majority of these animals for their own consumption and sometimes they are sold.  Mar\u00eda has 2 dependent children; she is a single mother.  She decided to take on her activities to give her children a chance to get ahead.  Her oldest daughter helps her with school expenses.  Her business is in her home; she is requesting the loan to be able to invest in the purchase of small pigs and the food needed to raise them so she can later sell them live or by kilogram.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to one day have a pig farm to generate income and then be able to construct a well-built house, since the one she has now is maD. of tin. \r\n\r\nELIZABETH L. D. L. C.\r\n\r\nFor approximately 8 months, she has maD. her living from catalog sales (ladies' undergarments).   Her main customers are her neighbors.  For now she drives to Villahermosa to pick up her pre-sold merchandise.  Her suppliers are Vicky Form and Ilusi\u00f3n.  Her business allows her to financially support herself and to help her mother.  She is requesting the financing in order to invest in ladies' undergarments, pants and blouses.\r\nShe dreams of having a home-based clothing store, being that her main customers are the residents in the community where she lives.\r\n\r\nMARIA NINFA D.

She works on pre-sales, but through a middleman, to whom she has to sell her products at a reduced rate.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to have her business established one day and for her customers to contact her directly.  She also hopes to have someone to help her process her orders in a timely fashion, since making this handicraft requires one day per bedroll.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":442411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Basic materials for handicrafts and catalog sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nacajuca, Tabasco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T04:20:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ninfa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filogonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":34000,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2015.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2029.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2043.96},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2058.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2072.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2087.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2101.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2116.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2131.32},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2146.24},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2161.26},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2176.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2191.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2206.97},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2238.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.81},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.94},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.07},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.64},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.85},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":734.08,"local_amount":9330.3,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9353.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110686029,"comment":null},{"amount":1499.13,"local_amount":19054.3,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":19101.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080362,"comment":null},{"amount":441.79,"local_amount":5615.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5629.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952414,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

is 42 years old; she lives with her husband and 3 children in Guarari, Heredia, a poor region located in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. She is applying for a loan of 300,000 colons, and this will be her first loan with Fundacion Mujer.<P>\r\n\r\nAt first glance, one would not be able to tell, but Jacqueline has a chronic illness called fibromyalgia, a virus affecting her muscular abilities. She has been sick for roughly 10 years. In order to fight the pain brought on by her illness, she takes up to 15 pills every day. The pills help; but the best therapy, she says, is her work. By staying busy with her candle-making, among other things, she can avoid taking so many pills, which leave her very tired and feeling weak. Jacqueline, or Jacky as it reads on her business cards, finds candle-making to be therapeutic as well as a means to generate income which helps pay household expenses and put her children through school. Her faith and her business are what get her out of bed every day and keep her motivated to take on life\u2019s challenges with an optimistic outlook.<P>\r\n\r\nJacky has eleven years' experience in the sales business; candle-making she has started relatively recently and has found it to be both profitable and rewarding. Jacky could not afford to take any formal candle-making classes, so she taught herself through trial and error. She can sell her candles for up to 8500 colons each. Her candles sell fast and she earns much more than she did working at the local mall.  In a 12 hour day, she used to earn 7,000 colons working in a shop. Selling her candles, she can earn up to 350,000 colones per month. It takes her 2 days to make 8 candles.<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan would be used to purchase raw materials and molds necessary for the creation of her beautiful candles. Recently, Jacky has received an abundance of orders for a specific type of candle she makes, with butterfly decorations. In order to respond to this surge in demand, she would like to purchase 2 more molds necessary to the creation of these candles. The molds cost 11,000 colons each. At the moment she has many different molds which she uses to create a variety of colorful, scented candles. This loan will help Jacqueline to take advantage of opportunities for increase sales associated with the Christmas season. <P>\r\n\r\nUnder the business name \u00a8Creaciones Jacky,\u00a8 Jacky and her son, Alonso, have put together a homemade catalog with pictures of the candles Jacky has created. When he isn\u2019t studying chemistry at the National University, Alonso helps his mother sell her products to shops in the nearby mall.<P>\r\n\r\nJacky is a true entrepreneur. Whether she is making candles, painting ceramics, promoting her products or taking care of the family, she is always doing something--and that\u00b4s the way she likes

Her house is concrete but it only has running water and electricity; no sewerage.  Gioconda opened a locksmith shop thanks to her husband who worked for a welder 10 years ago.  However, because they did not pay him on time nor offer any benefits, he decided to use what he had learned and open his own shop.  He also began to teach his skills to Gioconda.  Now, Gioconda and her husband work from 8am to 5pm.  They buy solder, anti-rust paint, and black metal sheets.  Some of their better known customers bring their own raw materials in order to save a bit on costs.  One of the greatest complications they face is when the government rations electricity use and some of the projects they work on irritate allergies in their three children, who are students at the local elementary school.  With the funding she wants to buy tools and equipment so that she can have a larger customer turnover in order to provide a better life for her family.

She is a single mother of two children who completed 9th grade. In the past, Blanca has received two previous loans of 500,000 colones,each that were repaid on time and in full. This will be her third loan from Fundacion Mujer and she is happy to be applying for a larger amount than she has in the past (650,000 colones).\r\n\r\nThe name of Blanca\u00b4s business is \"Confecciones M.\" (M. Apparel). Blanca makes and alters clothing. Her specialty is creating children's pajamas. She makes more profit from selling pajamas than from other types of clothing. She also makes women\u2019s clothes (blouses, skirts) and offers various customized products.\r\n\r\nBlanca sells her clothes to a distributor who comes to her home in Santa Barabara every 15 days. The distributor purchases children\u2019s pajamas (for ages 12 and under) and women\u2019s clothing to sell throughout Costa Rica. Blanca has been in this business for 20 years. She opened her business with an initial investment of 125,000 colones from loans from a friend and her sister. In a good month, she can earn 500,000 colones; in a bad month, only 300,000. Blanca plans to use this loan to purchase raw materials and invest in a new sewing machine.\r\n\r\nBlanca has been sewing all her life. She has been making clothes for as long as she can remember. She is a hard-working woman who dedicates 12 hours each day to her business. The income she earns from sewing is the only source of income for her family. Her goal is to open a boutique where she can sell children's clothes. \r\n\r\nDue to the high costs of raw materials, Blanca has not been able to re-invest in her business. Her lack of necessities, such as elastic, fabrics, sewing thread, and other raw materials, have hampered her businesses growth. This loan will enable Blanca to purchase larger quantities of raw materials from her suppliers in San Jose. By purchasing in volume, she is confident that she will be able to secure better prices. With this loan, Blanca hopes to generate more income and provide a higher standard of living for her children.

A fast learner, he quickly began to notice all the possibilities for this type of service in Massachusetts and in 2005 started working for himself. His most difficult challenge was the language. <P>\r\n\r\n\"I was not fluent in English, and I still am not yet, but it was much worse in the beginning. I had to pay someone to translate everything for me. I overcame this language barrier because my clients saw the perfection of my work and they were very happy with it.\"<P>\r\n\r\n\"This is my 4th loan with AUSA. I used my 2 first loans to start building my credit in the US and the 2 most recent loans I used to purchase new equipment for my business. I used credit cards to purchase supplies, but I try to pay the full balance every month to avoid paying the high interest they charge. I read about ACCION USA in a local Brazilian paper. For now I am just focused on expanding my business, but I wish to save and buy a house for my retirement.\"\t<P>\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<P>\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and proviD. employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":448503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"Equipment

She lives in a relative\u2019s house, and what she wishes for most is to live out her old age in peace.  Knitting handicrafts is the activity by which she earns a living, and she has a workshop in the residence where she lives.  She has 2 knitting machines that she uses to make different finishes for her clothes.\r\n\r\nEusebia sells as a street vendor in the various markets of the city of Juliaca because she feels this method allows her to approach a greater number of customers.  What she enjoys most about her work is chatting with patrons, which helps pass the time during her long workdays.  She has been carrying out this activity for 10 years, and finds the most difficult aspect of her work to be walking all day long in search of potential buyers.  In the future, she hopes to establish a stationary site where she could sell her wares more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis is Eusebia\u2019s fifth loan with MFP, and she knows that she must pay her installments on time.  She hopes to do this, as she doesn\u2019t want to cause any problems for the other members of her cooperative bank, where she is very well liked.

She started in the business of making knit handicrafts at a young age and, working for others, managed to support her family.  Now, Leonarda has purchased her own knitting machines and works filling orders for a textile enterprise.\r\n\r\nHer work is very high quality, which has led to an increase in orders.  What she enjoys most about her trade is being able to be with her children while she works to fulfill orders.  She has been carrying out this activity for 4 years, and finds the most difficult part of her job is having to work every day to meet her goals.  In time, she hopes to buy more machines to increase her production.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she feels capable of making her payments on time.

She lives in her own house along with her husband (Teofilo), 47 years of age, and their two children:  Humberto, who is 10 years old, and Re\u00f1idla, who is 5.  They are the reason she puts forth so much effort to succeed.  Her business is located in one of the most central parks in the city of Juliaca.  Her snack stand is one of the busiest, given that it is well stocked and people know that they will find what they are looking for there.  This has made her business very profitable, and motivates her to dedicate herself fully to it.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is chatting with her customers, as this helps ease the burden of all the long workdays.  She has been carrying out this activity for 2 years, and she considers the most challenging aspect of her business to be at her stall all day long without pause.  Over time, she hopes to rent a site in the same area where she could provide a higher level of service to her patrons.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan that Lucia has accessed with MFP, and she knows that the funds will help her improve her future prospects.  However, she also knows she must make her payments on time in order to not create any problems for her cooperative bank.  She will use the 1,000.00 Peruvian soles she is requesting to buy more mechandise, in order to better supply her snack stand. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":449786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-16T12:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734942,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124265,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":168.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960006,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992851,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717639,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":166.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751325,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T17:09:29Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":162631,"name":"Sebastiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sebastiana es una mujer de 44 a\u00f1os que durante toda su vida ha trabajado muy duro para sobresalir en la vida.

She lives in a rented house with her little daughter and is willing to work hard to give her a good life.\r\n\r\nIn the comfort of her home Victoria weaves her colorful handmade clothing. She works every day beginning very early because she needs to fill orders for a trader from the United States, who takes her clothing to sell in his country.\r\n\r\nBut Victoria does not only sell what she weaves. She also collects a larger amount of clothing from other weavers, who in turn receive a fair payment for their work.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is that in some way she also helps her fellow women to move forward.

B. is  a 58-year old widow who lives in Batang, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.

She has seven children, five of whom work and help her meet household expenses, while the other two are in school.\r\n\r\nLetecia joined NWTF-Project  Dungganon in 1994 in the hope that she could help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of loans  from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase her family's income by selling fish and other foods. She now earns an average monthly income of  PHP 10,000 from her business.\r\n\r\nLetecia is a member of good standing in our organization. She has taken out and repaid loans for PHP 22,000 which helped her improve her business and her family's life. She is now applying for a new loan, her 21st, for PHP 24,000, which she will use to continue expanding her business and provide her family with a brighter future and a more comfortable life. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a word that means honorable).

With the funds she is currently requesting, she will purchase merchandise for her beauty products business, to maintain them in stock and thus achieve higher sales during this Christmas season.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":449884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Increasing her stock of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-16T14:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":448.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":460.49},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":489.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":515.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":532.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":553.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.4},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":156.84,"local_amount":448.12,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":452.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734945,"comment":null},{"amount":161.17,"local_amount":460.49,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":464.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124268,"comment":null},{"amount":171.16,"local_amount":489.01,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":493.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960009,"comment":null},{"amount":180.57,"local_amount":515.92,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":520.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992854,"comment":null},{"amount":186.4,"local_amount":532.58,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":537.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717642,"comment":null},{"amount":193.86,"local_amount":553.88,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":559.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751328,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T03:20:13Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":162655,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita B. is from the village of Cabuan, Guinsiliban Camiguin Province.

With the help of his loans  from NWTF-PD, he has been able to increase his family's income by engaging in fish vending, driving three tricycles, and running the rice farm and a fish pond.  Now, he earns an average monthly income of Php 90,000 from his business activities.\r\n\r\nRomulo is a member of good standing. His previous loan of Php 29,000 was used to fund operations of his fish pond, rice farm and fish vending, and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, he is borrowing his seventh loan in the amount of Php 29,000, which he  intends to use on the fish vending business and motorcycle operations. Romulo is working hard to achieve his dreams and aspirations for his family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\").

Q. is a 43-year-old married woman who lives in Hacienda Minahan, Brgy Odiong, La Castillana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running a general store and selling ready-to-wear clothes.\r\n\r\nHelen\u2019s husband helps her in the business, and they have three children who are between 10 to 16 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nHelen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a general store and ready-to-wear clothes. Now, she earns an average monthly income of Php 5,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nHelen is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 16,000 was used to fund operations of her general store, and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 13th loan in the amount of Php 18,000, which she intends to use on ready-to-wear clothes. Helen is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon; (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":448761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

A. is from the village of Cabuan, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province.

Candelaria has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Candelaria joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Mar\u00eda has a pupuser\u00eda, an eatery where she makes pupusas, mornings and nights.\r\n[A pupusa is a thick, hand-made corn biscuit-like flat bread (made using masa de ma\u00edz, a maize flour dough used in Latin American cuisine) that is stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (queso) (usually a soft cheese called Quesillo found in all Central America), fried pork meat ground to a paste consistency (called chicharr\u00f3n, not to be confused with fried pork rind which is also known as chicharr\u00f3n in some other countries), squash (ayote), or (pataste), refried beans (frijoles refritos), or queso con loroco (loroco is a vine flower bud from Central America). There is also the pupusa revuelta with mixed ingredients, such as queso (cheese), frijoles (beans), and chicharr\u00f3n or bacon. Pupusas are similar to tortillas and especially to arepas. In fact, in El Salvador, normal tortillas are about the same diameter and thickness as pupusas, without the filling.)]  She needs financing because she would also like to start to sell basic food items as well as to be able to buy ingredients, like corn, beans and rice, that she needs for her pupusas.  Mar\u00eda hopes to increase her sales to have a positive effect on her economic situation since, at her age, her wish is to be able to count on having the basic things necessary to live.<br

In her store she has chicken that sells for $1.25 per pound, soft drinks that sell for $1.20, and milk that sells for $0.75 per liter.  One of the biggest complications is when the vendors in her area are robbed and on these occasions they cannot bring products to her house.\r\n\r\nTeodora is not married and this makes it difficult for her to support her 2 children, one who is 10 and studies in public school and her daughter who is 18 and is still unmarried.  With the loan she wants to buy telephones to rent, cooking oil, toilet paper, soap, etc.  In the future she wants to enlarge her shop so that with the earnings she can build her own house.\r\n\r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":450292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" to buy telephones, cooking oil and toilet paper                          ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T01:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":47.96},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49.18},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.96},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.01,"local_amount":47.01,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":47.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679528,"comment":null},{"amount":47.96,"local_amount":47.96,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074057,"comment":null},{"amount":49.18,"local_amount":49.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":49.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910024,"comment":null},{"amount":50.82,"local_amount":50.82,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945589,"comment":null},{"amount":51.73,"local_amount":51.73,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":51.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673952,"comment":null},{"amount":53.3,"local_amount":53.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":53.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708115,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-17T06:15:02Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":162909,"name":"Ibrahim Minta","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur  I.

In the future he wants to build a place where he can expand the laundromat.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":450337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase coconuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T22:10:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":630,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":67.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.03},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.13,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":69.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074058,"comment":null},{"amount":64.44,"local_amount":62.46,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":64.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910025,"comment":null},{"amount":69.54,"local_amount":67.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":69.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945590,"comment":null},{"amount":70.03,"local_amount":67.88,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":70.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673953,"comment":null},{"amount":72.13,"local_amount":69.91,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":72.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708116,"comment":null},{"amount":73.65,"local_amount":71.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":73.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891322,"comment":null},{"amount":75.71,"local_amount":73.38,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":75.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631593,"comment":null},{"amount":77.45,"local_amount":75.07,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":77.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845489,"comment":null},{"amount":77.92,"local_amount":75.52,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":77.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111785,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-22T11:19:38Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":162925,"name":"Eloy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eloy tiene 23 a\u00f1os el cual tiene un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os y su esposa es la que tiene el negocio de venta de asaditos, empanadas, refrescos y otros, ellos viven en alquiler desde hace mas de tres a\u00f1os en la misma casa, que es de su pariente.

She has improved the business little by little since at first she only had one table along the street with some pails for drinks, and now she has her own food stand. There is always competition with this kind of business and it is always increasing, since when she started out she was the only one in the area and now there are others selling food, but Eloy's wife continues to have a good flow of customers.
