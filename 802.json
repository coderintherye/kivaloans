Silvio and his wife have lived together with their children in Chimor\u00e9 for many years.\n\nSilvio is a truck driver on a route that runs between provinces in the Tropic of Cochabamba area.  Like many people, he works extra hours so that he can provide his family with a better standard of living.  In an attempt to make more journeys, he suffered a traffic accident.  As he was tired, Silvio fell asleep for a few moments on a return journey.  Luckily, there were no personal injuries or material damage.  However, he ended up in a ditch in the oncoming lane and his engine suffered a blow which left it seriously damaged.  It managed to get him home but, shortly after, it stopped working.  Silvio has other debts that he pays off each month.  If he doesn't manage to fix his engine, he will be left without his main source of income and will fall further into debt.\n\nSilvio's wife works as a seamstress and makes a low income.  Right now, Silvio needs a small loan with interest that he can afford to pay so that he can restore his vehicle and thereby keep working.  This will enable him to pay his debts and support his family as he has always done.  For this reason, he came to us to request a loan because he found out about our Kiva loans.  Silvio was very interested to learn about this type of loan and the fact that he could benefit from them.\n\nSilvio hopes that his children will enjoy a better future.  He also hopes to pay off his debts and offer his family a better quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1005351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy an engine for his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-03-07T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-06T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvio Alejo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":227.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-01T22:11:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392538,"name":"Albina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Albina es una se\u00f1ora que tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad, ella  vive en casa  familiar junto a su hija.

Using his connections to Latin and South America, he was able to set up both a domestic and international distribution network. All of Carlos\u2019s generators are bio-fueled machines and work solely on vegetable oil or in accordance with it. Along with distributing in Florida, where he now resides, he set up his strongest ties throughout the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and Ecuador. Most of the sales come in the form of large wholesales; however, he is also open to the public market as well. Along with the actual equipment, Carlos also offers support and warranties for his sales. The business is set up so that the buyer pays a down payment on the equipment before actual sale; however, this never covers the entirety of the purchase. The sale is paid in full only after delivery. Due to this, Carlos is left putting up much of the initial cost.

For seven years she has been renting avocado and peach orchards whose fruit she picks and then sells in the local wholesale food market by the bucket.  She says that she really enjoys her work because it leaves her time to care for her children as she goes out very early in the morning to sell her fruit and in the afternoon she is free to do her housework.\r\n\r\nTrinidad is married to Jes\u00fas who also sells fruit.  The couple have two children: 9-year-old Eduardo who is in elementary school and 18-year-old Mayra who is in high school.  Trinidad says that she is requesting a loan so that she can rent an additional orchard which will make her a little more profit so that she can have a little more money saved up for dealing with any emergencies that her daughter or any other members of her family might experience.  Trinidad's daughter Mayra has suffered from childhood-onset diabetes since she was 11 years old and she has to be alert because sometimes her blood sugar levels rise.  She has to keep control of the situation, both in terms of what she eats and her medication, so that she doesn't fall ill because medicines are very expensive.  Trinidad's goal is to own her own orchard.

She recalls that it was very small, and was used to buy some supplies since she lacked working capital.  Prior to this business, she used to sell clothing and enchiladas from place to place, but she realized that by selling tortillas she could earn a better income more rapidly than she did by selling clothing.  She gets up very early to work in her humble kitchen so that she can have the hot tortillas ready to sell to her customers, who seek her tortillas for their breakfast to eat with cheese curds and a cup of coffee.

He is part of the Las Abejitas Trabajadoras (The Little Worker Bees) group, and he says they gave themselves this nickname because they are very hard workers willing to fight for a better life. Jorge has made a living baking bread for more than four years after a friend taught him the trade at a time in his life when he didn't have a job and had to make headway for his son, so his friend offered to teach him. Jorge says that he is requesting this loan to purchase ingredients to bake bread, such as milk, eggs, flour, firewood, sugar, butter and other times. He sells the bread in different stores in town. The stores make their orders, and he delivers the bread very early. He is very excited about the loan because it will increase his sales as he will invest a little more in the ingredients.

She lives in her own house with the youngest of her five children. The others are independent and work in the city. Her house is her own and is located in the neighborhood of Cumutay, in the Huasahuasi district.\r\n\r\nZenovia is a woman radiating with strength and joy. Despite her age, she continues to plant peas, potatoes, corn, and some other vegetables. She likes her work as she does it side by side with her son who helps unconditionally. She takes advantage of the day from the first rays of sunlight in the morning. That way she is able to ensure that all of her produce is cared for. One of the things she does not like are the times when her crops are not cared for properly and are therefore affected by pests. She remembers with sadness the time that she lost almost all of her crops, however, with experience that life has given her, she continues to work. The majority of the time she has had a good income through her sales. \r\n\r\nIn addition, she has five large cows and three little ones that provide milk with which she make cheese. According to her, she sells 15 cheeses each week through which she makes an extra income. \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue working because she likes to feel busy and useful. She belongs to the communal bank \"Lindo Amanecer de Cumutay\" and this will be her tenth loan with MFP. She is very grateful to all of the people that make this loan possible. For this reason she is committing to being punctual with her payments. Upon receiving the money from this loan she will use it to purchase one bag of pea seeds and four bags of organic manure.

It is a new group and its members are very excited to be able to receive help from these loans to start a business.  They decided to give their group this name because there are some beautiful light towers near the place where they meet.  They all agreed upon the name.  The members live in a town called San Pedro el Alto, in the municipality of San Felipe del Progreso.  San Pedro del Alto is a community that has services such as gas stations, tortilla bakeries, schools, clinics, etc.  It is a very complete community, though the area where this group was formed is called San Jos\u00e9 and there are no streets there.  There is a lot of farmland and cornfields and the residents can be described as very kind people.\r\n\r\nThe names of the six group members are:\r\n1. Genoveva D. - 26 years old - will invest her loan in buying three pigs, as well as feed and corn with which to raise them, so that she can later sell them.\r\n2. Rosalina V. - 39 years old - will invest her loan in her grocery store, buying soap, sugar, soft drinks and eggs to sell.\r\n3. Carolina Q. - 30 years old - will invest her loan in buying three pigs, as well as feed and corn with which to raise them, so that she can later sell them.\r\n4. Patricia M. - 33 years old - will use her loan to buy feed and corn for fattening the four pigs that she already has, so that she can later sell them\r\n5. Irma R. - 35 years old - will invest her loan in buying two pigs, ten chickens, as well as feed and corn, so that she can raise them and then sell them.\r\n6. Octavia Q. - 35 years old - will use her money to buy two pigs and eight turkeys, as well as feed and corn with which to fatten them, so that she can later sell them.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is called Irma and she is 35 years old.  She has been married to Antonio for 19 years.  Antonio carries out building jobs in their community.  The couple have five children.  Their eldest is a son who is 19 years old, single, and currently works.  Next they have a daughter called Rosaura who isn't currently studying.  They also have a 10-year-old son who is in fifth grade, an 8-year-old who is in third grade and their youngest who is a 2-year-old boy.\r\n\r\nIrma is requesting this loan so that she can start buying and selling animals such as pigs and chickens.  She decided to join this group because she was invited by a neighbor and also because she was very keen to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nIrma says that she will carry out her business in the following way: once she has received her loan, she will buy her young animals in her community and take them home.  She says that she would like to set up a small pen where she can raise them appropriately.  She has great faith that this will be a good business and will help her to improve her family's life if it goes well.  Once she has her animals home, she will buy them feed and ground corn so that they grow.  She will later sell them and recoup what she invested.  She says that she will sell the animals in her community without having to travel far.  She is very happy to be able to receive this loan as she says that previously, owing to a lack of money, she couldn't even imagine managing to start something like this.  Irma describes herself as a very respectful and hard-working person.  \"I like to help my husband because there are no jobs here and we have to find a way to make progress\", comments Irma.  This loan, without doubt, will help her to start her business and improve her life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1018726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-10T01:31:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399118,"name":"Huitzililla Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Cruz va a comprar perfumes y cosmeticos, la se\u00f1ora Eleuteria va a comprar sorgo y maiz molido, la se\u00f1ora Tomasa va a comprar pan, mayonesa, jamon, verduras para preparar tortas, el resto de las integrantes siguen en su actividad que vienen desarrollando.

This group is made up of nine very hard-working and cheerful women who make their sales in order to earn a little extra money and provide their children with a better quality of life.  They live in a community which is noted for being in a sugarcane region.  Their husbands work in the fields (sowing and cutting sugarcane).\r\n\r\nObdulia is 41 years old and studied up to high school level.  She is a single mother and has three children.  Her eldest child is called Karen and she is 19 years old.  She is studying at university.  15-year-old Brenda is in high school and 9-year-old Luis Angel is in elementary school.  Obdulia tells us that she has always had to work to provide for her children and pay for their education.  A little over 10 years ago she started selling chicken together with her friends and neighbors in her community.  However, over time, and as a result of the hard work her whole family has carried out in order to get themselves ahead in life, they have managed to become suppliers.  They currently supply chicken to all the ladies who sell in their community.

After seeing no future in his town, he decided to move a few years later to Mexico City where he enrolled in beauty school and learned the skills of the trade very well.  As a young boy, he enjoyed giving haircuts so he chose this career because he saw that it would be a good business.  He now has an aesthetics practice in town that he started seven years ago.  One of his challenges is being able to pay the rent since the rates have gotten so high.  Rodrigo says that he is requesting a loan to buy beauty products such as cr\u00e8mes, makeup, nail polish for manicures and pedicures, shampoo, dyes, bleaches, and liquid products used on the hair.  He indicates that all of the products that are used on his customers are purchased in Mexico City from different stores that offer low prices.  This allows him to earn some profit.
