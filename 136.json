She is on her second individual loan following four group loans (solidarity loans), which have all been repaid without difficulty.  With this new loan, she intends to buy:  10 pieces of pagnes (Real Wax and Wax Hollandais), 5 pieces of bazin fabrics of lesser richness, and 5 pairs of shoes, in Bamako (capital of Mali).  Wholesale merchants are her source.  To customers essentially composed of salaried women, she makes her sales at the retail level in cash and on credit, payable monthly in the case of enterprises.  She also makes sales out of her home.  Because of the quality of the fabrics sold, Ms. Kadiatou F. is known throughout the city of S\u00e9gou.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to realize a monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA, which

She has been selling firewood since 1988, having learned the business from her mother, and uses all of the profits from her sales to help care for her family.  \r\n\r\nUp to this point she has operated with little capital, but with demand for firewood growing, Vero is missing out on business due to a lack of capital to keep a larger stock of firewood on hand.  She is therefore hoping that Kiva lenders can help her with a loan of $525 to enable her to buy more firewood to sell.  With the loan, she will be able to go to the forest and buy the wood in bulk for a lower per-piece rate.

By forming a committee they could access loans quickly and easily which is useful for all of the jobs that they carry out. In the beginning, the committee encountered many difficulties in their organization, and although all of the members are neighbors there were people who could not adapt to working as a team and had to separate themselves from the organization.  Today San Miguel has accomplished a full integration of all of its members and an excellent organization, with which the loan amount of increased each day allowing them to work with a greater quantity of capital. All of the committee members are mothers and homemakers and each day they work to increase the incomes of the households and improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nIn the attached photograph Lorenza V. and Isacia F. do not appear.

Elias has been doing repairs in the community for more than six years. He told us that the number of clients is growing, and in a little while he'll be able to increase his income and make his family more comfortable.

The loan will be invested immediately in the store by purchasing more goods that her clients are interested in.\r\n\r\nAfter joining FINCA Per\u00fa she has been able to improve her business, and is very grateful that she has been able to save more and invest more in her business. Right now, Martha is saving the income she receives from her business to fulfill her dreams of making sure her children are educated to become professionals, and she would also like to move and start her business in another area, Huancayo. \r\n\r\nAna Q. R., another member of the group, also lives in Huancavelica with her husband and 3 year old son. Her business, which she has had for two and a half years, includes the buying and selling of animals such as pigs and cows. Though her business is doing well now, she has had some trouble in the past, as do all start-up businesses. Since Ana joined FINCA Per\u00fa her business has improved and she can only hope it will continue to do so. The loan she has requested will be invested in her business for the purchase of more animals and to increase her capital. She is currently saving to buy a house in Huancayo and start her business there.

The institute was founded in 1985 by the Catholics of St Joseph of Cluny, and is the only formal institution in Magburaka that is geared towards the development of girls and young women. Their goal is to educate them and develop skills that will enable them to become self reliant. Thus they offer courses like computer science, typing, agriculture, tailoring, dyeing, hair dressing, catering and weaving. They serve mainly girls who can not make it in the formal schooling sector.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan St. Joseph Vocational Institute is requesting from Kiva through SMT. Their previous loan was a great help to these teachers. Some of them invested theirs in business, others used theirs to settle their children's school affairs and others use theirs to buy pieces of furniture. \r\n\r\nFlorence K. Y. is the head mistress of the school. Mrs. Y. (back right in pink) was born in Magburaka. She is 39 years old, married to a teacher and the mother of four children. Three of her children are in secondary schools and the fourth is in primary school. Mrs. Y. invested her previous loan in the education of her children.

C. is 46 years old and single. She has four children, two of whom are married. Her two younger children, both boys, are 18 and 13 years old. Her older son is finishing high school, where he studies Computer Science, and her younger son is a freshman in high school. Her partner, who she lives with, is a mechanic and sells bicycle parts to help support the family. For the past four years, Mrs. A. C. has owned a small local store located at Kilometer 104 of the Leon Chinandega highway, which is better known as Telica. This is her second source of income: she is a schoolteacher, but does not earn very much since her teacher's salary is so low. Since her partner doesn't earn very much as a mechanic, either, she decided to open the store to better support her children. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to inject more capital into her small store to offer a wider variety of merchandise for household consumption and to grow the store into one of the biggest in the area. With this loan, she plans to expand and strengthen her inventory by buying rice, sugar, oil, soda, detergent, cosmetics, chicken, eggs, milk and other products. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She doesn't have any other income other than that she makes at a small beauty salon, which she has been doing for 15 years. Her intention is to create employment. Her biggest dream is to enlarge her salon and be one of the best stylists in Leon and later in the country. Another one of her dreams to have her own place where she can tend to her customers since she currently is renting. Among her intentions is to be able to help her children make headway and become professionals. Mayra started this activity because ever since she was very young she like doing it but she didn't have the means necessary to go to school and become a professional stylist, but little by little she came to learn the trade. The loan will be used to purchase necessary supplies for her work.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Her husband does not work, but he helps her with the development of the business. Ms. G. has been making and selling tortillas, fresh beverages, baked beans, and soft drinks for 10 years. This small business suffered the battering of Hurricane Mitch, during which time there was a mudslide on the hill where her house is located. Nevertheless, with the desire to press forward and to obtain a source of income, she started this business, which is currently her only source of income. She used to be involved in agriculture, but upon losing everything, her life turned around completely. With the support from the loans, she has been able to get ahead. She is currently requesting this loan with the aim of being able to purchase the ingredients needed to make baked beans. Her wish is to be able to set up a general store and expand her business in the future.

Aside from this business, she is a farmer. Currently she cannot cultivate her rice plantation because she does not have enough animals to plow the field. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy one more cow to help the old one plow her field. Her husband, Mr. Ung Phang, is a construction worker who can earn less income to meet the family expenses. Mrs. Pol S. is 42 years old and the mother of two children, who are both attending the local school.

End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.
