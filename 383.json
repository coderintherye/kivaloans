Heng A. and Saei C. all live in Preaek Thom Village in Kandal Province, Cambodia. The six members of this lending group are part of AMK\u2019s Loan Workout Program. All clients have outstanding loans that are delinquent and they are currently unable to pay back the full amount of their existing loan. \r\n\r\nTheir business ventures, which they funded using their existing loan, have failed, putting them in a very unfortunate position. In addition, less work at garment factories and sickness in their families have drastically reduced other sources of income for each family. All six clients will use their loan to start a new business making T-shirts.\r\n\r\nAs part of AMK\u2019s workout program, each client is given a workout loan that will be used to purchase sewing machines, an electricity line and additional sewing equipment. AMK has hired a tailor to train the group to make T-shirts. The material will be provided by AMK to ensure that quality material is used and so that the clients do not have to purchase it themselves. \r\n\r\nAMK has partnered with Ahkun.org to sell their T-shirts online. Fifty percent of all profits will go to this group and the other borrowers in their village who are unable to repay their loan.\r\n\r\nThis program is in contrast to the traditional ways that microfinance institutions deal with delinquent clients:\r\n\u2022\tBy rescheduling the loan and pushing off the problem to another day\r\n\u2022\tRepossessing items that the clients own, including their house or land.\r\n\r\nBecause of AMK\u2019s strong social mission, AMK has created this program to provide an alternative solution to one of microfinance\u2019s dark sides.

is 47 years old, married, and has three children, all of whom are in school. He makes a living as a farmer and also helps his wife, who is an accountant, provide accounting services. He is a member of Faulu Kenya and a loan group named Ujamaa. This makes it easy for him to get loans because the other members of this group help ensure that he will pay. He appreciates the help he gets from Faulu Kenya, particularly to open an office for his accounting business. He has applied for a loan of Kes.65,000 to buy a motorbike to transport his produce to market. He hopes to expand the market for his goods and someday have a well-established

is a thirty-seven-year-old married lady. To earn a living, she sells charcoal to people who live near her home. She has been in this business for five years. She says that her business turnover is high because charcoal is the cheapest cooking fuel in the area. Since she joined Faulu Kenya, her business has expanded because she can access loans. She saves her money with a group under Faulu Kenya named Winners, which enables her to access loans because the members guarantee each other. She has limited stock and yet high demand, therefore, she has requested a loan of 40,000 KES from Faulu Kenya to increase her stock of charcoal.

Ellas se dedican principalmente a la venta de ropa usada, ropa interior, comida seg\u00fan la \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o (por ejemplo humitas), reposter\u00eda y cocteler\u00eda, atenci\u00f3n de centro de Internet, zapater\u00eda y bordados.\nLa socia entrevistada fue Esperanza, quien es la presidenta de este grupo. En la foto se encuentra en 1\u00ba fila, agachada, tiene el pelo hasta los hombros. Ella tiene una rotiser\u00eda (donde se venden alimentos perecibles y no perecibles) en su casa. Con el cr\u00e9dito quiere ampliar su negocio, ya que su sue\u00f1o es tener un minimarket, que cuente con una gran variedad de productos, no solo alimentos, sino que tambi\u00e9n art\u00edculos de librer\u00eda. Para lograrlo quiere ir incorporando de a poco productos nuevos, por ejemplo su pr\u00f3xima meta es comprar una fotocopiadora. \nAdem\u00e1s tiene otras metas personales como sacar su 4\u00ba a\u00f1o de educaci\u00f3n media, lo cual est\u00e1 realizando este a\u00f1o en jornada vespertina, para as\u00ed m\u00e1s adelante estudiar una carrera. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es ser fuente de trabajo para otras personas como ella, con ganas de superarse. Su gran motivaci\u00f3n es su familia, sus dos hijas, de 11 y 2 a\u00f1os y su esposo que la apoya en todo.\nEsperanza siente que Fondo Esperanza significa un pilar muy importante para su desarrollo personal y estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y est\u00e1 muy agradecida de la facilidad con la cual ha obtenido sus cr\u00e9ditos.\nTemuco es la capital de la regi\u00f3n de la Araucan\u00eda. La ciudad se ubica a 670 kil\u00f3metros al sur de Santiago (capital de Chile) y posee una serie de balnearios lacustres y una flora y fauna nativa muy llamativas. Cabe destacar que en esta regi\u00f3n habita el 50% de los mapuches, pueblo ind\u00edgena, existente en nuestro pa\u00eds.\n\n\n\n","en":"The communal bank \"Avanzando Contigo\" is made up of 16 members from the city of Temuco.  They work mainly in the area of retail sales, including sales of used clothing, underwear, food according to the season of the year (for example, tamales), and catering.  Other members also attend to an internet cafe, make and repair shoes, and do embroidery.  \r\n\r\nThe member interviewed was Esperanza, who is the president of this group.  In the photograph she is found in the first row, crouching, with shoulder-length hair.  She has a deli (where she sells perishable and non-perishable food) in her house.  With the loan she wants to expand her business, since her dream is eventually have a mini-market where she can sell a large variety of products, including not only food but also office supplies.  To achieve this she wants to start gradually incorporating new products into her business.  For example, her next goal is to buy a photocopier.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she has other personal goals such as completing her last year of high school, which she is doing this year in the evenings, so that later on she can begin to study for an advanced degree.  Her main dream is to be a source of work for others like her who want to succeed.   Her greatest motivation is her family: her 2 daughters, aged 11 and 2, and her husband who supports her in everything.  \r\n\r\nEsperanza feels that the Fondo Esperanza supports her personal development and economic stability, and she is very grateful for the easy terms at which she has been able to access credit.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is located 670 kilometers to the south of Santiago (the capital of Chile), and has number of lake resorts and colorful vegetation and wildlife.  It is worth highlighting that this region is where 50 percent of Chile's Mapuches (indigenous people) live. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

En la foto se encuentra en el 4\u00ba asiento de izquierda a derecha en la 1\u00ba fila. Ella tiene un minimercado en su misma casa y es una herencia de su mam\u00e1. \nDamaris invertir\u00e1 este pr\u00e9stamo en comprar mercader\u00eda y apartar\u00e1 lo que le falta para hacerle un cobertizo a su negocio, para de esta manera prepararse para la lluvia del invierno. Su sue\u00f1o es ampliar su negocio y poder alg\u00fan d\u00eda entregarlo como  herencia a sus hijas. Tiene 2 hijas, una estudiando en 4\u00ba a\u00f1o medio y la mayor que le ayuda en el negocio. \nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Damaris de trabajar con Fondo Esperanza es conocer a m\u00e1s personas emprendedoras igual que ella, ya que as\u00ed aprende de las experiencias de sus compa\u00f1eros y se pueden aconsejar mutuamente. Adem\u00e1s comenta que le ha servido mucho la educaci\u00f3n sobre el manejo del dinero en el negocio.\nTemuco es la capital de la regi\u00f3n de la Araucan\u00eda. La ciudad se ubica a 670 kil\u00f3metros al sur de Santiago (capital de Chile) y posee una serie de balnearios lacustres y una flora y fauna nativa muy llamativas. Cabe destacar que en esta regi\u00f3n habita el 50% de los mapuches, pueblo ind\u00edgena, existente en nuestro pa\u00eds.\n\n\n","en":"This bank is called \u201cCamino al Futuro\" (Path to the Future) and is comprised of 13 members from the city of Temuco.  They primarily work in making food like \u201csopaipillas\u201d (a type of fried pastry), \u201cmote con huesillos\u201d (a traditional Chilean summer-time drink), hot dogs, empanadas, barbecued beef, and prepared breakfasts and lunches.  Some members have grocery stores, mini-markets, provide photocopies, or sell furniture.\r\n\r\nDamaris is the member that was interviewed.  She is the secretary of the group.  In the photo she is in the fourth seat from left to right in the first row.  She has a mini-market, which she inherited from her mother, in her house.  \r\n\r\nDamaris will use the loan to buy merchandise.  She will put aside what she needs to make a shelter for her business.  That way she will be prepared for the winter rains. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her business to be able to someday give it as an inheritance to her daughters.  She has two daughters.  One is in her fourth year of high school, and the older one helps with the business.\r\n\r\nWhat Damaris likes the most about working with Fondo Esperanza is meeting more entrepreneurial people who are like her.  That way she learns from her colleagues' experiences, and they can give each other advice.  She also says that the education about managing money in business has helped her a lot.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. The city is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (capital of Chile). It has a series of marshy spas and very colorful vegetation and wildlife.  It is worth stating that 50% of the mapuches, indigenous people, that exist in our country are living in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Her business is one of the best supplied in the neighborhood, a great service to her neighbors.  Nueva Arica is a sparsely populated area (14 people per square kilometer).\r\n\r\nMaria Confesora wants to expand her business by buying fresh produce.  She has asked Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 500 nuevos soles that she wants to use toward that end.  \r\n\r\nMaria is an honest and hard-working woman.

She has operated a small general store for several years, a business that she started with help from her husband who has a truck that he uses to make deliveries for the store.  The couple has four children, three of whom are in school and able to help around the house.  The oldest works.  She started the business with only a handful of products, selling firewood, fruits and vegetables.  With her earnings, she was able to buy food and everyday supplies but the money never stretched far enough to make improvements to her little house, a house built from wood and earth that Zoraida would like to improve for the well-being of her children.  She will use this loan to buy construction materials--stone, sand, cement--so that she can remove the wood and enclose the entire structure in concrete, something that will better secure the house.  She is happy to have received this loan and past ones because they have helped her to improve both her house and her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":522041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy construction materials for home improvement project.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-09T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soraida Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.81,"local_amount":1106.4,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640166,"comment":null},{"amount":53,"local_amount":1110.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821958,"comment":null},{"amount":52.96,"local_amount":1109.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561968,"comment":null},{"amount":52.97,"local_amount":1109.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770883,"comment":null},{"amount":53.66,"local_amount":1124.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204775,"comment":null},{"amount":51.98,"local_amount":1089.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1111.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330473,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":1117.59,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465631,"comment":null},{"amount":52.21,"local_amount":1093.85,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1116.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097778,"comment":null},{"amount":53.23,"local_amount":1115.29,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348403,"comment":null},{"amount":48.84,"local_amount":1023.49,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766086,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-14T04:07:29Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192150,"name":"Lapaz Tb Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther A. describes herself as hard-working, a woman for whom no challenge is too great.

She owns a house made of cement and has all the basic services.  Her husband is a long-time construction worker and they have 2 children, both in school.\r\n\r\nCleotilde began sewing on an old borrowed sewing machine.  She decided to use her small savings to buy materials and cotton wadding to start a business making rag dolls that she sold in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nShe has been making the dolls for 20 years now, selling them to individuals and stores.  Thanks to the earnings from the business, she was able to set up another business selling gas cylinders for cooking, but she's never given up the doll-making business.  Her house is on a hill in Paraiso de Guayaquil and, consequently, it's very hard to move the gas cylinders back and forth.\r\n\r\nCleotilde will use this loan to buy gas cylinders for her new business and, in turn, generate extra income for her family.

Her main source of income is farming.  \r\n\r\nFor more than 10 years, she has sold beer in a small bar that she runs from her house.  The business is an important source of revenue for the family because Maria Luz's husband's income as a farmer isn't enough to cover the family's expenses.  For that reason, she gives her all to advancing the business.\r\n\r\nThe business has become well-known in the area after growing little by little.  Maria Luz wants to expand further by adding products that her customers want and, consequently, she's applied to Edpyme Alternativa for a 1500 new soles loan to help her meet that demand.  \r\n\r\nMaria Luz is a happy woman, devoted to her family, and her greatest wish is to provide them with a better quality of life.

She thinks her business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a very long time.\nDorothy\u2019s loan would be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

He is an honest and hardworking man who is married to Alberta, 54.  Together they have 3 children, of whom only one still lives with them in their own house: a house constructed of rustic materials.  For more than 25 years, he has worked with citrus fruit, bananas and avocados.  On top of that he has a business of supplying native fruit from the Peruvian jungle.  In harvest times, he has the help of his dear wife and of his oldest son.  This way he can give a comfortable life to his family.\r\n\r\nIn his business when he is selling, he likes to take care of his customers.  Nevertheless, he doesn\u2019t like to carry the heavy crates that he takes to market to sell the fruit.  In the future we would like to buy more hectares of land that would allow him to plant a large quantity of coffee.  In this way his children can harvest the coffee and they can get earnings from the crop. This is his fifth loan with MFP, and he tells us that his crops will be as successful as they are now. He is happy to work with the communal group since the members are all united.  With the three thousand new sols that he is requesting, he will lease a bigger field where he will plant citrus fruit.  Besides that he wants to buy dozens of sacks of fertilizer and insecticides to avoid the infestations that eat his fruit.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":522098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To rent a field and buy fertilizers and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-09T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3047.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886313,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-18T16:12:09Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192181,"name":"Ramona Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ramona del Rosario M. es soltera de profesi\u00f3n, profesora de primaria desde hace quince a\u00f1os en la escuela Efra\u00edn Tijerino Mazariego, vive en reparto Jos\u00e9 Benito Centeno tiene dos hijos pero solo uno depende de ella.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Ramona del Rosario M. es primer vez que trabaja con cr\u00e9dito en esta instituci\u00f3n con el fin de realizar la construcci\u00f3n de un  cuarto en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n  \n","en":"\r\nRamona del Rosario M. is single; she has been an elementary school teacher at Efra\u00edn Tijerino Mazariego school for 15 years.

R. is 50 years old and lives in the Milagro neighborhood in the city of Cartagena with her husband and 4 children aging from 24 to 30 years old. It is in this community that she has a business called Variedades Sandy where she sells all types of goods such as trousers, jeans, sheets, towels, school shirts and blouses for cash, although she also has some customers that she gives credit to. It is for this business that Julia is asking the financial foundation for $2.300.000, to buy goods such as jeans, sheets, towels, school shirts, blouses, at the request of the customers that she has in various neighborhoods of the city. \r\nJulia has been developing her entrepreneurial ability every since she had a shop with her husband, which she considered to be a good business but very time-consuming,monotonous and which did not agree with her lifestyle. She used to dream of something different, less routine and innovative and where her daughters participate as they do now at Variedades Sandy, therefore she feels her current business is a better decision. When they decided to sell the shop they were left with only two display cabinets and capital that was invested in economic goods in line with their goal sector. This business started to progress very well and it was through a friend who recommended the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation where she found the opportunity to get low interest capital, with which she bought goods to expand her business. Her first loan was in a group and for a total of $300.000. There she received training in business management to achieve what is today \u201cher dream become reality\u201d. Currently she has an individual loan, but she has received 14 and with these finances she has managed to develop her business and give her children an education - they are studying at university, fashion design and administration respectively; and at the same time her daughters work with her and they are the fantastic trio, each one in their own work and between the three of them they contribute to each others' sucess. Julia wants to project her business into new areas, and feels very happy with it. With her profits she has managed to build three apartments, she lives in one of them with her family, and the other two she rents which gives her additional income.  Also her business premises, which was at first in the living room of her home, is a product of the success that she has had working in her micro enterprise, and this is generated by the family union and the collective work directed towards the same activity and with unique family goals.  Julia is very grateful to the Foundation because they believed in them and because they helped to generate a positive impact for her children; it is important to point out that today they are partners of Variedades Sandy, and they feel proud of their parents and of the efforts that they made to achieve something that started out very small; as well the community acknowledges and supports this business as they know that Variedades Sandy fulfils an important role in society and it is there you find everyone. \r\n \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva

It is located two hours away from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Berelinda has been raising and selling barnyard fowl and small farm animals.

She owns and operates a fishing business, harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marianita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell.\r\n\r\nMarianita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her 4th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

B. is a 56-year-old married woman who lives in Barangay Bantayan, Calatrava, Negros Occidental. She earns her living with her general store and fish-vending business.\r\n\r\nTeresita\u2019s husband, Juanito, is 60 years old and is a fisherman. They have six children who are between 16 and 38 years old. Five of their children have their own families while their youngest child is still currently going to school and also helps in the business as part of the daily chores.\r\n\r\nTeresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and fishing business. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nTeresita is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 10,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and fish-vending business which had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n\r\nNow, Teresita is borrowing Php 10,000 as her 9th loan which she intends to use for her general store and fish-vending business. She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":521118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use as

A. is from the village of Panaon, Misamis Occidental. She is 34 years old. Rhodora is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Rhodora owns & operates a motorcycle transport business of which her husband is the driver operator.  She also has a \"sari-sari\" (variety) store. The main source of income for the business comes from providing motorcycle transport services to local community members.  Rhodora has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Rhodora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rhodora has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Rhodora is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the 13th loan taken out by Rhodora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":513701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She is 55 years old. Virginia is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a business making and selling food, primarily selling snacks and other delicacies, in the local community. Virginia has been engaged in her business for 7 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Virginia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 7,500 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Virginia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Repaso's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josa  R. is from the village of Panaon, Misamis Occidental. She is 30 years old. Josa is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is J. R.'s Group. \r\n\r\nJosa is married. To make a living, Josa owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" (variety) store. The main source of income for her business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josa has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josa has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. \r\n\r\nJosa is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Josa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b> \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":512912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

dias, en su mayor\u00eda son trabajadores de la zona que acuden a almorzar durante la hora de almuerzo, su buena saz\u00f3n y la amabilidad con la que trata a sus clientes han hecho que su negocio goce de muy buena preferencia.\n\nLa continua demanda por su negocio ha hecho que los insumos con los que cuenta no sean suficientes para brindar una buena atenci\u00f3n, por ello Hilda desea ampliar su restaurante con la compra de mesas, sillas y algunos insumos para preparar m\u00e1s platos de comida, por ello se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un

She lives near the city of Chiclayo, a city well known for its commercial and transport activity.\r\n\r\nThe need to move ahead and help her children some 8 years ago led her to launch a business selling meals from her house.  She began with few utensils and little supplies and thanks to her effort, the business has grown.  At present, she already has a small restaurant where she waits on customers every day.  The majority are workers from the zone who come for lunch around lunch time.  The good flavors of her food and the amiability she displays towards her customers has resulted in the restaurant gaining favor.\r\n\r\nThe rise in demand has resulted in short supplies, affecting her service.  For that reason, Hilda wishes to buy more supplies and to expand her restaurant by buying tables and chairs. Then she will be able to prepare more plates of food.  For that reason, she approached Edpyme Alternative for the first time, requesting a loan of 2,000 new sols that will help her achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nHilda is an amiable woman who likes her work very much.  Her great hope is to continue growing as an impresario.  She is much admired by those who know her.  They consider her a woman with confidence and fighting spirit.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":522368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"BUYING TABLES, CHAIRS, AND SUPPLIES TO IMPROVE SERVICES IN HER RESTAURANT","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-04-10T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Clarisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.76},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":178.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.26},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":196.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.79},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.76,"local_amount":131.76,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":135.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695118,"comment":null},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":146.73,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":150.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878163,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":149.44,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":153.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618192,"comment":null},{"amount":54.69,"local_amount":150.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":155.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832592,"comment":null},{"amount":57.68,"local_amount":159.13,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":163.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099198,"comment":null},{"amount":457.51,"local_amount":1262.09,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1297.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554620,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-13T17:11:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192293,"name":"Magali Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora M.

The profit from these businesses has been the main source of family income.  She is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount of 45,000 PHP to purchase feeds for the pigs and to support the maintenance of their fishing business.  The capital will fund further expansion of the family ventures to support Adelaida\u2019s dream that her children will complete college degrees and find good jobs.\n\nAdelaida hopes to maintain long-term sustainable businesses.  During the course of her membership in ASHI, she has been a model member dedicated to managing her family\u2019s operations.  Her future goals are to purchase a new jeepney for her husband so they can expand the territory of their fish selling business to other surrounding neighborhoods. By owning her own transportation, Adelaida will save time and money in selling products in additional territories.

This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Jeaneth from ASHI.

Married to Renante, a driver, she is blessed with a child in their marriage. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her own fish stall while also operating a small variety store and a clothing store. She also operates a jeepney (small bus) which is being driven everyday by her husband.\r\n\r\nGirlie has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her businesses, Girlie would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding businesses by buying more products to be incorporated into her current product inventories.\r\n\r\nGirlie dreams that her businesses will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.

She started her business using the loan she received from ASHI when she became a member in the year 2002. This was just small then but because of so many trials due to poverty, Lorina strived hard to make it grow and expand. Her vision of giving her three children a better future using the proceeds of her business enhanced her eagerness to explore the potentials of her business. Her husband has been so supportive to all her ventures. Looking back at Lorina\u2019s business, now it has a lot of accomplishments. Before, her franchised fried chicken rolling store operated only in one municipality and was transported by bicycle. Now it operates in four neighboring municipalities and is transported by motorcycle. Lorina feels happy with her business achievement. However, it is not yet stable enough for her to feel financially secure. Without her a loan, her business can never grow, especially when time comes when her three children (whose ages are from eight to 13 years) are ready to go to college. Therefore, Lorina is requesting another loan in a larger amount to put up another business, which is a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for transportation. She hopes that by having several businesses, she will have more income, have more savings for the future of her children, and will be able to help her other relatives by employing them to work with her in her businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":522874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

During that time and despite a lot of challenges she remained strong and supportive of all ASHI programs and activities. She has enjoyed the company of other borrowers and has learned a lot through  the center's weekly meetings. She has enhanced her skills in managing and growing a fishing and fish-selling business because most of them are in the same kind of business. Fishing and selling fish in partnership with her husband is Moreta\u2019s main source of income. She wants to grow her business further until it is stable and can improve her family's standard of living. She is requesting a larger loan through ASHI to buy a motor boat to be managed by her son and husband. That will increase the amount of fish they can catch and sell, increasing her profits. Despite being poor, Moreta believes that, through the loans she can access, someday she will have stable income and a sound life along with her family.

Pha K. is a villager in Chrak Chi Koam village in Takeo province. She breeds pigs and on the side makes white wine. Since her business is going well she wants to expand it, but she does not have enough money so is asking for a loan to buy more pigs, pig food, and vaccinations.

She lives with her husband and child in a traditional family in the Hamdallaye district of the town of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). For social reasons she did not go to school and learnt at an early age from her mother, who sold condiments, how to manage an income generating activity. After several years' apprenticeship, she has for the past eight years been developing by herself the same kind of business as her mother, and she enjoys a large customer base and a certain notoriety. She is well known at the Castle market and the strength of her sales is due to the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nWith a view to increasing her business in order to meet customer demand, she has turned to the micro-finance institution, Soro Yiriwso, from which she has been granted her first loan. She is planning on using this loan to buy 20kg of pepper, 10kg of \"fi\u00e9fi\u00e9\" and 5kg of garlic, baskets of fresh tomatoes, packets of Maggi stock cubes and a bag of kitchen salt, from wholesalers in Bamako.\r\n\r\nMrs. Assitan Sidib\u00e9 sells on cash and for credit to a customer base made up of men and women. She is hoping to make a monthly profit of 75,000FCFA which will allow her to diversify her activities, by carrying out sheep fattening and making up wedding trousseaux for her daughter. Her ambition is to build a house to live in.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

Ye Na Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akua D. describes herself as truthful, a woman who faces reality. She is 53 years old and is the leader of the 'Boafo Ye Na' borrower group. Akua lives in Bibiani and sells dried fish in the new market in town. She has been running her fish business for 5 years. Akua is excited to be taking out this loan, which she will use to purchase one large basket of dried fish. Previously, this loan amount would have enabled her to purchase two medium baskets of dried fish, but the market pricing is increasing and fish is becoming more expensive in her community. \r\n\r\nAkua also runs an herbal medicine business. She goes to the forest, gathers herbs and plants, and prepares the medicines herself. She wants to use the extra profits she anticipates as a result of this loan to buy a plot of land and build a small structure from which she can operate her medicine business.

They know each other well and all live in large traditional famlies with their husbands and children. They are 38 years of age on the average, and  each woman has at least four children. The women of the Djiguiya group trade in various articles: cereals, heating wood, preparation and sale of pancakes (such as the ones   Mariam B. bakes), clothing etc. In order to enlarge the scope of their activities, two years ago they have decided to take advantage of the loan programs of Soro Yiriwaso. Mariam B., who is in food sales, plans to use her loan in order to purchase millet grain, oil and sugar  at the big market of Kouiala and heating wood from the vendors of nearby towns. Je sells her pancakes each evening in front of her front door,  on the pavement by the Catholic mission school.  There is a lot of customer demand as she is good at baking pancakes and they are very popular. While other members of the Djiguiya group plan to obtain a monthly income of 80,000 West African Francs each, Mariam B. plans to achieve an income of 110,000 West African francs. In addition to repaying the loan, they will use the income to help meet the family expenses. They seek collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso in order to avoid running out of stock on their goods. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":522975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing millet grain and other ingredients for the preparation of pancakes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-13T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00ef ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746621,"comment":null},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779177,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961380,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699495,"comment":null},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913400,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180570,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-15T14:36:32Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192433,"name":"Yeredon (Se Conna\u00eetre) Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Yeredon est un regroupement de femmes, toutes mari\u00e9es, ayant  en moyenne 34 ans, 3 enfants et vivant dans de grandes familles traditionnelles avec leurs maris et enfants dans la quartier Madina Koura de la ville de Koutiala (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion de la r\u00e9publique du Mali). \nLe groupe Yeredon fait essentiellement l\u2019achat et la vente des chaussures, des habits, des fruits et l\u00e9gumes etc. \nPour augmenter la taille de leurs activit\u00e9s, les membres du groupe Yeredon ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9grer le programme cr\u00e9dit de Soro Yiriwaso il y a trois ans.

","en":"Gonzalo is a 35 year old man who is married with 2 children, aged 2 and 7.  He lives in the Barrio Fabril zone near Blanco Galindo Avenue at Km. 7 in the Colcapirua Zone of Cercado Province.  This zone is considered agricultural, since it is on the outskirts of Cochabamba City.\r\n\r\nGonzalo drives a taxi along the zone's routes.  His wife works in a school in the community of Pucarita Chica, 3 hours travel from home, requiring 3 changes of buses.  But they have adjusted to the schedule and its requirements and are accustomed to rising very early every day.  Their young children remain in the care of their grandmother while both parents work mornings, but they are very young.  And the youngest has a harelip which was operated on with foreign assistance but he still requires the care and attention of the parents for his recovery since there were complications.  For that reason, Gonzalo's wife had to take a year off from work.  Now that their little one is better and has recuperated, both parents are determined to work hard in order to recover from the child's operation.\r\n\r\nGonzalo requests a loan to buy replacement parts and to carry out general maintenance on his taxi.  He tells us that one of his major dreams is to make enough one day so that his wife can stop working and devote herself 100% to their children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold

She lives with her 21-year-old son. The other two children went to work in Argentina out of necessity.\r\n\r\nJacinta\u2019s principal occupation is the production of raw milk, which she sells to a business that makes dairy products. Right now, she has five dairy cows. She also grows corn, potatoes, and beans with the help of her son.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be use to purchase another dairy cow to increase milk production. Her goal is to continue to increase production and in this way improve the quality of life for her, her son, and her one-year-old grandson. In the future, she would like to build a new house, as hers is old and has few rooms.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva

She has been a widow for four years.  She lives in Cochabamba with her only child.  Raimunda lives in the Maica Central neighborhood on the outskirts of the city.  It is an agricultural zone in the Cochabamba department.\r\n\r\nRaimunda devotes herself to raw milk production and selling cheese in the market in the city of Cochabamba.  Since her husband died, she has been in charge of all of the household expenses, the care of the dairy cows, milk production, and making cheese.\r\n\r\nHer 13 year old son helps her sell the cheese at the local market.  Raimunda works everyday, including Sunday.  She starts work very early, and she works without rest until the sun goes down.  Raimunda knows that this effort is for her son\u2019s well-being.  It is so that he can study a career when he finishes school.  That way he will later be able to support himself.  Raimunda will not be able to support him for a long time due to her advanced age.\r\n\r\nRaimunda came to the offices looking for a loan.  She wants to buy balanced food to increase milk production and making cheese.  That way she will be able to increase her sales and her income.  She will be able to save in order to be able to pay her son\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":523025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy food for the dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-04-12T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raimunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144689329,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872785,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159612815,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166827104,"comment":null},{"amount":666.68,"local_amount":666.68,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":666.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093426,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-12T20:17:17Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192470,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 29-year-old man who lives in Beirut, the capitA. of Lebanon, with his wife and their child.

They are an exemplary family, and they are organized.  They fight day to day to overcome the death of their mother and to pull through with the necessities.\r\n\r\nJose is asking for a loan to buy material for making clothes.

P., 57, is well known by people of the town of Soledad for her dedication to her business. Elvira has 10 washing machines that she rents to the households in her neighborhood and those nearby. This helps the householders to get their washing done while they attend to other chores, and at a fair price.\r\n\r\nElvira started out with three machines and now has ten. However, she needs to replace them as they have worn out. With this loan of 2,000,000 pesos, she will buy four new machines, which will improve her service to her customers.\r\n\r\nElvira has always been a businesswoman. In 1999, she had two stalls in the market in a place called Miami, and in 2001 she built a gym in her home with the money from selling the stalls. This business lasted only two years because her house was small and she wanted to make more income. At this point, she started the washing machine rental business among her friends and family, who gradually recommended it to others.\r\n\r\nHaving a business has been important to Elvira and her family, as it has enabled her to pay education expenses for her son who has now finished a course in Business Administration.\r\n\r\nElvira\u2019s most important goal is to open an office on a main street of Santuario, a neighborhood in the south of Barranquilla, to increase her earnings. In the future, she would like to partner with her children in a taxi business in the town of Soledad. \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge now is selecting good clients, as there is a risk that someone will steal the washing machines. For this reason, she works with neighbors, property owners and people with references, and she is careful that the machines are returned on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

Also, she and her children were thrown out of her husband's house by the husband's family. This has been a big setback for her and her children. This hardship forced her embark into the trade of buying and reselling items like beans and palm oil.\n \nThe quest for business capital encouraged her to join GHAPE in 2007, and since then she has taken and repaid loans two times. She now needs a bigger amount of capital in order to expand her trading business. She knows the business will succeed because she has been doing this trade for a very long time and she has also learned marketing strategies from GHAPE, a Kiva partner. Also, her business will help the community buy from her nearby place rather than buying from afar, which increases cost.\n\nWith her profit, she is planning to expand her business, educate her children and she desires one day to buy a piece of land on which she can build her own house.  \n\nMargaret\u2019s loan would be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and toward poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

in 1964, Victorine K. was married and had four children, but she divorced her husband. She now lives with her six children. Her source of motivation is from the difficulties she faced, especially the death of her mother, poor health, her inability to continue her education and the destruction of her cassava farm by wildfire. This further compounded the situation and the consequences include an inability to educate her children, even in primary school.\n\nEncouraged by GHAPE borrowers, she became a member of GHAPE and received her first loan of 40,000CFAF in 2007. Since then, she has proven her ability to receive, invest and repay loans up to the amount of 130,000CFAF. From previous loans she provided her community with shaa (locally produced drinks from corn). She is proud of her achievements, especially her success in owning and managing her own business. With profits from these loans, she has been paying her children\u2019s school fees. \n\nGiven a loan, she plans to continue in the same line of business. She provides drinks to the community and the business will succeed since people know her and usually call her \u201cmami shaa.\u201d Her intention is to use the profit to continue to educate her children and take care of her health and the family. \n\nVictorin\u2019s loan would be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and toward poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.
