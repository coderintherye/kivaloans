is married and has 4 children. His family lives in Kumsangir, Tajikistan. Saidodkhom is a small entrepreneur and an owner of a grocery store, selling food items in his home town. His store is well known in his community for the variety of inventory and his reasonably priced, quality goods. Saidodkhom has managed to stay afloat for 5 years. He admits that it has been partly possible due to the consistent demand for the type of merchandise he offers for sale. \r\n\r\nSaidodkhom is seeking a loan of $3000 USD to purchase additional merchandise and to increase his turnover capital. He has an enterprising spirit and is always full of ideas on how to improve his business and make it even more profitable. Saidodkhom has a good credit history, which secures prompt repayment of the current loan.  \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Loans that Abdumavlon has received from IMON International have helped to promote stability and growth in his business. \r\n\r\nAbdumavlon is asking for a loan of 7,000 Somoni to purchase necessary car parts to fix his minivan. He understands the effort and commitment it takes to be a private entrepreneur and is willing to work hard in his business to be able to support his family, which is the first priority in his life. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

On this occasion, we are visited by the sister of one of the members.  In the photo, the member is dressed in a purple blouse, and her sister is behind her.\r\n\r\nThis is a group of people who decided to come together in order to obtain their first loan with the purpose of improving their businesses and their lives.  They make their livings in various activities, such as commerce, sales, production and services.  This is the first cycle with the communal bank for our friend and for the group itself.  They are very satisfied because the loans are easy to get. \r\n\r\nHere we meet Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda.  She is 25 years old, is married and has a 2 1\/2-year old daughter.  Her husband works for a shipping company.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda is a good housewife and makes her living in commerce.  She sells all types of clothing from a catalog and sandals.  She makes her sales going door to door and also from customers who pre-order their purchases.  In addition, she sells products from her home.   Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda sells her merchandise on credit and collects payments on a weekly basis.  This provides her an advantage, as she she makes use of the collections time to make new sales.  She gets the sandals from a distributor in Portoviejo, and she purchases the clothing in Guayaquil. She works alone, has been running this business for three years, and she tells us that it has been going very well for her.  What she sells the most of is sandals and women's clothing.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to purchase merchandise, like pants, shirts, blouses, sandals and other items, in order to grow her business.  Her dream is to one day have her own home, since she currently lives in her in-laws' house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":695627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase sandals, pants, shirts, blouses etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-01-19T03:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley Celinda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George Geovanny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alexandra Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvis Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunci\u00f3n Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2915,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":364.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":364.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":364.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":364.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":364.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":364.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":364.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":364.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":731.26,"local_amount":728.76,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":731.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841574,"comment":null},{"amount":731.26,"local_amount":728.76,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":731.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283955,"comment":null},{"amount":731.26,"local_amount":728.76,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":731.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151865,"comment":null},{"amount":731.22,"local_amount":728.72,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":731.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211224702,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-19T10:17:37Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:12:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":266227,"name":"Maria Mavel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda resiD. en Puerto el Triunfo departamento D.

She is 49 years old. Virginia is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has no children. To make a living, Virginia owns & operates a business selling \"tuba\" native wine in the local community. Virginia has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 1200 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Virginia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nVirginia is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & to fund working capital. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Virginia from PMPC.  \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They selected this name because, thanks to the loans they have had, they are making progress for a better future for their families .  The group is located in the state of Mexico.  It is comprised of nine members.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda De Lourdes Gonzales D. L. is a member of the group.  She is 37 years old, and she only has an elementary school education.  She grows flowers, and she has three children (one girl and two boys).  She started growing gerbera (a flower from the sunflower family) two years ago.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy plants and fertilizers for her next crop.  Her customers say that Lourdes has a different variety than the other people who grow gerbera.  That is why they prefer the flowers that Lourdes grows.  She started as a hard worker, and she accordingly was gaining knowledge.  She decided to start her crop.  Thanks to the loans, she was successful.  \r\n\r\nAs she is requesting this loan she feels very happy, and she is very encouraged to keep making progress.  She wants this loan to start the crop that she will harvest for Valentine\u2019s Day in February.  She hopes that one day she will have the opportunity to travel to other countries to learn about their flowers.  That way she will continue to make progress in order to give her children a better education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":695773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy natural and chemical fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Lucero","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":35000,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1796},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1843},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1890},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1938},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1988},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2039},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2092},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2145},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2257},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2315},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2374},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2435},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2498},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2562},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2628}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.03},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.96},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.14},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.4},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.26},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.47},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.4},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.49},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1498.52,"local_amount":17932,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":17976.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195982135,"comment":null},{"amount":992.74,"local_amount":11879,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":11908.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264183,"comment":null},{"amount":433.74,"local_amount":5189,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5201.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206131089,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-02T02:20:12Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":266282,"name":"Tumenbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tumenbayar is 38 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Uvurhangai province in Mongolia.

C. is from the village of Baybay Triunfo, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 47 years old, married, and has one adult child. To make a living, Lucita owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  She has been in business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lucita joined PMPC to access financial services to improve her living situation and to engage in business activities.  Lucita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to purchase additional products to sell.  \r\n\r\nLucita is now requesting a loan of 30,000 PHP to purchase more groceries to sell. This will be Lucita's 8th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":391.5,"image":{"id":691610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. is from the village of Tabid, Ozamiz City. She is 64 years old, married, and has one adult child. To make a living, Conchita owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for two years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, Conchita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. She is now requesting a new loan of 14,995 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Conchita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for any future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Northwestern Mindanao. It reaches to rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 30  years old. Jena is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nJena is married and has two school-aged children. She owns & operates a general store where she sells a variety of products. She has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn March 2010, Jena joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. Jena is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She has been in her business for 16 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Anita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nequieta from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The booming cell phone service industry employs thousands of employees and is a top taxpayer with huge contributions into the country\u2019s budget. \r\n\r\nNargiza T., 32, is a leader of this group. She previously worked as a clerk for a cell phone providing company. Getting acquainted with this industry, she opened a shop selling phone accessories and communication appliances. Step by step she managed to broaden her assortment of products and build a regular customer base. She spends the generated revenue paying for rent, taxes and purchasing fresh models of accessories for reselling.

She hopes to make every single member of the group happy by offering each one a part of the loan. \r\n\r\nDilbarkhon B., 49, is a leader of this group. For the past two years, she and her husband have been involved in a cattle reselling business. Most of the work is done by Dilbarkhon, because her husband\u2019s main occupation is construction. Purchasing cattle is not a simple process. Customers usually pay careful attention to the physical appearance of the animal, its health and price. Sometimes Dilbarkhon has to wait several days in order to sell the cattle at a good price. Thanks to her good bargaining skills, she is usually successful. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t get help from her children in taking care of the cattle, because all three of them are pursuing a degree in the bigger city of Osh. She is happy with how life has turned out and wishes her children the best. After thorough consideration of the financial possibilities, Dilbarkhon applied for a loan, which she would like to spend on buying more cattle. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (being environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Azizbek is single and doesn\u2019t have any financial dependents. Two years ago he embarked on a household goods and office supplies sales business. He used 30,000 soms for a business start-up and since then his business generates a significant income allowing him to cover all his expenses and have some savings. Azizbek has heard of another very successful market, Jibek-Jolu, where he would like to rent a place to work. He believes that moving to a new market will increase his income. The purpose of the loan is to purchase a container to strengthen the business. Azizbek values the loan and pledges to make his payments on time. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. \r\n\r\nMansueta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase dried fish to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Mansueta from PMPC.

She is 26 years old, married and has one school-age child. She leads a two-person loan group affiliated with PMPC. While each member of the group gets an individual loan, both are responsible for paying back the entire loan if the other person is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMaricel makes a living by selling snacks to people who live in her community. She has been engaged in this business for almost one year and earns about 1,000 PHP a month from her work\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maricel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and her ability to engage in business. Her loan group is  applying for its first loan, and she plans to use her 4,000 PHP portion to buy piglets to raise and later sell. She plans to use the additional income she earns from this loan to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or

She makes hand embroidery when she finds herself free from household work. She does this work part time. The money she earns helps her fulfill the basic needs of her family. \r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s name is M. R. and he is a loader by profession. He uses his horse cart for his business and loads different items such as fruits & vegetables and construction supplies on it and earns a good income by dropping the load at the destinations.  \r\n\r\nMunawar is the mother of two sons and two daughters. Her elder son is a rickshaw driver while her younger son works at a petrol pump for a low income.  Her daughters are attending school and getting their education. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband who wants to dispose of his  current business because it requires great physical effort and sometimes he gets work and sometimes not, so he will buy a rickshaw with the loan amount. The rickshaw will help him to serve many passengers and earn a good income for his family.  \r\n\r\nMunawar is hopeful that an investment will be profitable for her husband and he will successfully operate his new business.

is 41 years old and lives with her husband and three children, aged 7 to 18 in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her family lives in a small house in the outer ger districts of the city. Her oldest son studies at high school and her daughter and younger son attend secondary and primary school. Her daughter is preparing for the International Mathematics Olympics and she is a top student. \r\n\r\nOtgonjargal is in charge of operating the small food store in her family\u2019s yard with regular help from her husband.  The grocery store is in a small cabin that must be kept warm by constantly keeping a fire burning in the winter.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, when she first began operating a business, she served  customers with a telephone service at an outdoor market. In 2005, she and her husband together built a small house and she opened a small grocery store. Her store sells candies, bakery products, purified water, juices, breads, vegetables and other small foods. Besides food trading she also sells small bags of firewood and coal. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, her family bought a small truck with her business earnings. Now, her husband sells coal and firewood from the truck.

She has been doing this work for the past 7 years and has a good number of clients in her community. \r\n\r\nNosheen's husband is a painter by profession and paints on houses and walls on order.  It is very difficult for Nosheen to manage her household expenses but she never compromises on her children\u2019s education. She has 3 children and all of them are studying. \r\n\r\nNosheen has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to improve her embroidery business. With this loan, she will buy embroidery materials such as beads, colored thread and tassels in bulk to fulfill larger orders and make more income.

Her business is located at Kakamega town. Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugarcane and it is known as the sugar belt region. She has been selling shoes to the local people for the last six years. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is the fact that there are so many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers and so customers are not loyal because they are spoiled by the choices. She also says that the purchasing power of the people in the area is low, leading to slow movement of stock. However, she works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 40,000 to buy more shoes to expand her business and meet the various tastes of her customers. She hopes to grow her business to wholesale in the future.

K. is married with six children. He lives in Isfara in Tajikistan. \r\n<p>\r\nIslomjon has been in a manufacturing business for 33 years. He takes an individual approach to each client, helping with color, shape and configuration. Little competition and good quality work have resulted in good profits for Islomjon and much positive feedback from his clients. \r\n<p>\r\nIslomjon is requesting a loan of 7500 TJS. The loan will allow him to purchase necessary materials, provide his customers with trendy and modern products, and increase the assortment of inventory he offers to his clients. Islomjon takes his loan liabilities very seriously. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan:\r\n<p> \r\nTajikistan is known for its rich place in history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the farthest reach of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is 38 years old and married. Her husband is a teacher. They have three children, ages 13-17. They hope to provide their children with a good education up to the university level. Her business is located in Kakamega, a region in Kenya known as the sugar belt for its production of sugarcane. She sells chicken feed to the local farmers. In addition to this business, she also keeps dairy cows for milk and chickens for eggs. She has been in this business for the last two years. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is financial constraints. However, she works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well.

She has been running a guest house for students for 20 years.  She works there from March to December.  Sonia is a widow.  Her partner helps her to maintain and run the guest house.  Sonia's services include cleaning and providing food.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of January and February, Sonia doesn't rent out her guest house because she prefers to rest and make any necessary repairs.  She is supported financially by a small sum of money that she receives as her widow's pension and also from cooking and selling 'humitas' and 'pastel de choclo' (traditional dishes).\r\n\r\nSonia will use this loan to buy five doors to replace existing doors on the rooms in her guest house.  She will also hire a master builder to repair a leak in the roof and paint part of her outdoor area.  Sonia's dream is to build a second floor with more rooms to rent out.  Her motivation is to financially help her three daughters and grandchildren to whom she feels very committed, even though they no longer live with her.\r\n\r\nSonia's previous loans from Fondo Esperanza have been very useful.  It has been useful for her to be able to rely on this capital.  The training sessions have also helped her to organize her expenses.  She feels very good about the fact that Fondo Esperanza have placed their trust in her by giving her the loans.  She also has a very good relationship with her fellow group members.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is located 670 kilometers to the south of Santiago (the capital of Chile).

We feel it is worth pointing out that this region is home to 50% of the Mapuches (indigenous people) in our country.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":695584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To buy five doors and pay for repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-01-19T15:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":258378,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27458},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27575},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27934},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28298},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":28667},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":29040},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":29418},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29801},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30187}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.15,"local_amount":55033,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":57571.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839735,"comment":null},{"amount":180.72,"local_amount":84899,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":88815.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282227,"comment":null},{"amount":124.44,"local_amount":58458,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":61154.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150234,"comment":null},{"amount":127.69,"local_amount":59988,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":62755.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223318,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-19T17:05:24Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":266480,"name":"Philister","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philister is 37 years old, married and a mother of two.

Benita's business is selling earrings, necklaces, purses and clothes in a very busy shopping center.  This business is very convenient for her as one of her family members also sells these products and provides her with merchandise to sell.  This means that she has a range of high-price, good-quality products which are very popular with her customers.  What Benita most likes about her business is that she gets to know a lot of people, it keeps her occupied and whenever she has any new merchandise she quickly visits her customers.\r\n\r\nBenita has been in this business for two years, selling her products for cash or leaving them on credit.  However, sometimes things get complicated when she has a customer who doesn't pay all of their instalments.  In the future, Benita plans to re-build her home since it is currently made from wood.

Early the next day she goes out to buy the necessary ingredients to prepare her dishes.  She has gained a lot of experience during this long period of time and has established her business.  This inspires her to continue selling her food and improve her business.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 18th loan with MFP and she feels safe knowing that she has financial support.  She has always been responsible with her payments and is pleased to be a part of her communal bank as all the members are responsible and very unified.  She is grateful to all the people who will be involved in making this loan possible since it will be very useful in advancing her business.  With the loan she is requesting, she will be able to buy new chairs as well as perishable and nonperishable ingredients.
