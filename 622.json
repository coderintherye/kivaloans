She likes the business and the fact that it allowed her to care for her daughters, who were young at the time.  Elizabeth works everyday promoting her products to friends and acquaintances.  She sells perfumes, lotions and deodorants via catalog and orders that her customers make.  Her work is difficult because of the competition and crime, as she has to go out to deliver her orders.  With the help of the loan, Elizabeth wants to purchase more products for her business to sell.  In the future, she hopes to be a Yanbal Manager.  (Yanbal is an international catalog-based sales company)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":508.28,"image":{"id":800697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase perfumes and display cases for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Guasmo)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2011-06-28T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.03},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.99},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.86},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.17,"local_amount":59.17,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-28T07:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":59.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221624121,"comment":null},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":59.91,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-30T07:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":59.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226993396,"comment":null},{"amount":61.24,"local_amount":61.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-27T07:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":61.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232752459,"comment":null},{"amount":63.03,"local_amount":63.03,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":63.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238556599,"comment":null},{"amount":63.99,"local_amount":63.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244515591,"comment":null},{"amount":65.75,"local_amount":65.75,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":65.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250723281,"comment":null},{"amount":66.86,"local_amount":66.86,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":66.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257126142,"comment":null},{"amount":68.33,"local_amount":68.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":68.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263251206,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-19T23:48:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":311583,"name":"Miriam Genoveva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miriam de 46 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona urbana en el Guasmo (fue nombrado as\u00ed debido a la especie de \u00e1rboles Guazuma ulmifolia.

She had the business for more than thirty years and with her earnings was able to offer wellbeing to her three children as a mother. When Andr\u00e9s became a teenager he went to school but since he already knew the business, when his mother passed away he took over the business and the care of his two younger siblings.  He lives with them now in the town of Malambo, since he had to take over this responsibility. Andr\u00e9s also got a job as an assistant salesman at a grocery store in Barranquillita, a popular neighborhood of Barranquilla where he has his business. He is happy with and with his aunt's cooperation in the his sales stall. His dream is to keep getting stronger because he wants to offer his sisters a technical education so they can get ahead in life. His biggest challenge is gaining the trust of suppliers and customers, who think that because of his young age he wasn't going to be able to carry on his mother's legacy. At present, in his business, he sells  pork rice, and fried plantains with chicken. He has two people selling rice from carts. The product he offers is of mass consumption, especially with the merchants from the public markets in the area and the passerby in the market. The operating expenses are relatively low, and family members are compensated with the other income that Andr\u00e9s receives. His working capital is made up of the business' daily sales. The operational cycle as well as the inventory rotation is one day long, since his product is is for immediate consumption. He does his buying every day so he doesn't carry a lot of inventory. The business' profits are acceptable, over 10%. Andres wants to increase his market and have wider coverage and he has the ideal personnel to do it with the cooperation of his aunt. He is asking for his first Kiva loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Nora en su pueblo  vende comidas   especiales para eventos, ensaladas fr\u00edas, rollos de carne, perniles, pechuga en rollo y tambi\u00e9n los fines de semana prepara deliciosos patacones rellenos para la venta. Ella inici\u00f3 este negocio  porque tiene un especial gusto por la  cocina y por eso aprendi\u00f3 viendo a sus hermanas, leyendo  libros, atendiendo los programas de culinaria  en la televisi\u00f3n y con un amigo trabajador de un Hotel.

She is an enterprising woman who lives in the town of San Jacinto, departament of Bol\u00edvar. She has 4 children, aged  33, 26, 22 and 19. The two youngest are on their own and work. Nora sells special food for events in her town, such as salads, meat rolls, pork, and rolled chicken breast.  On weekends, she also makes stuffed plantains to sell. She started this business because she really likes cooking and she learned watching her sisters, reading books and watching cooking shows on television as well as with a friend who works at a hotel. Nora's dream is to have a restaurant with comfortable infrastructure and to support her children so that they can learn a profession.  She is working on this little by little and since her clientele grows every day her working capital is insufficient. That is why she is turning to a Kiva loan. This is the first loan she has received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy cold cuts, mayonnaise, mustard, bread, corn, vegetables, pork, and a grill. This investment will be successful because among her customers are a group of teachers, independent workers, and housewives who ask for food for different social  and recreational events. She produces income every weekend at her stuffed plantain sales spot, which is well known. Her biggest challenge was when she moved from  San Juan to Cartagena because of the violence 12 years ago. But that is in the past and she was able to return and return to her dreams. While she is making her dreams come true she is working hard making profits of no less than 37.74%   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.82,"image":{"id":800688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cold cuts, mayonnaise, mustard, bread, corn, vegetables, pork and a grill.

She is married, and has 3 children ages 6, 8 and 12 years old. In 1992, she established her provisions shop. She began her business because she inherited it from her parents. So when she got married, she started doing it for herself from the little money given to her by her husband. She now enjoys doing business because she almost solves all of her problems and is able to assist her husband in taking care of the home.  \r\n\r\nWorking 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,000,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. She requires a loan in order to buy 10 cartons @ 72,000 SLL, mayonaise - 10 cartons @ 190,000 SLL, sugar (cube) - 10 cartons @ 100,000 SLL and soft drinks - 10 crates @ 35,000 SLL. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 250,000 SLL. She is convinced that in acquiring this loan, her shop will expand more than before, and she even hopes to establish another outlet so that she can assign one of her brothers to be selling there. With a second outlet she could realize more profits and therefore help her husband greatly in taking care of the home. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to acquire a piece of land and educate her children as well. Some of the profit has been put back into the business and some used to solve domestic problems. She has a plan to expand and continue accessing loans from Kiva partner Association for Rural Development. She is a very hardworking and dedicated woman with a good vision.

Louise-Martine was born on March 15, 1975 in Benin and is married to Emmanuel, a hotel owner.  The couple have five children, all in school and in their care.  Louise-Martine has never attended school. To meet her needs and those of her family, Louise-Martine sells her hardware products in her neighborhood.  Louise-Martine has been in business for almost four years, which has enabled her and her husband to take care of the various family expenses.  Louise-Martine stocks up in a city of Benin.

She is married to a carpenter named Victorin. The couple have two children, both enrolled in school, and live together with their children. Val\u00e9rie began selling charcoal at her home 13 years ago. Secondarily, she sells cookies. She buys her supplies in a market in B\u00e9nin.

After dropping out of primary school, Marguerite started, ten years ago, to prepare food (rice, corn pasta with sauce, etc.) that she sells in her neighborhood.

That is where she gained her vast experience in preparing food.  MatilD. is a widow and lives in the home of one of daughters in Aracataca.  Her daughter runs a restaurant in that town.  MatilD. has a fast food business where she sells hot dogs, burgers, fries and 'chicha' (a corn-based drink).  She carries out her business in the mornings in the Los Robles neighborhood, in the town of Soledad, in Atl\u00e1ntico department.  She works in rented premises.  In the afternoons, she works in Malambo, another town in the same department.\r\n\r\nMatilD.'s business has little working capital since her sales are generally carried out in cash and she has little inventory of raw materials and supplies.  She makes her purchases daily in grocery stores.  MatilD.'s goal is to increase her working capital so that she can buy her products in greater quantities and gain discounts for buying in bulk.

He achieved it after uniting with Georgina, when his desire for independence increased. Four years ago they used their savings to acquire a small store in the municipality of Galapa, which went well for them. However, since their plans were to achieve a bigger sales point, they moved to the parish of Juan Mina, where they acquired the store that they have today.  They bought the house on credit, agreeing to a term of 5 years to make the complete payment. To date, they only owe the last two years.  The financial state of the store shows the profit margin that allows them to easily cover their costs and expenses, which allows them to permanently reinvest in their business. Her inventory is adequate for this type of business and since she manages her cash flow with caution, her product turnover runs smoothly. Her profit margin allows her to have a good capacity to pay.

Her husband's name is Roman. Galina worked as a manager after graduating from the university, but has left her job because of small wages. She went to work with her mother in the ritual shop and within the last year the business operations were completely transferred to her.

Mohannad also learned the importance of education and hard work; he dropped out of school after the sixth grade to start working and contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nMohannad has developed his business for the past three years; now, he is requesting a loan of 1500 JOD to expand his retail capacity by purchasing some display racks and more clothing. \r\n\r\nMohannad is looking to a brighter future for his two daughters, his wife and himself. Someday, he would like to open a second shop; but, for now, Mohannad is trying to increase his income by offering his customers a larger selection. As his daughters grow into young women, Mohannad is saving to give them higher education and more choices than he had as a young boy raised in poverty.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1133.33,"image":{"id":801244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase some display racks and more clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"JO","country":"Jordan","town":"Bani Kenanah, Irbid","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31 36","type":"point"}},"partner_id":174,"posted_date":"2011-06-28T20:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohannad ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"JOD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":342.83,"local_amount":242,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":243.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221752948,"comment":null},{"amount":171.42,"local_amount":121,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":121.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227121846,"comment":null},{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":37,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":37.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232883563,"comment":null},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":100.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244658750,"comment":null},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250879212,"comment":null},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257288955,"comment":null},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263431087,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-24T18:22:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":311868,"name":"Angela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angela is a single mother and she is 45 years old.
