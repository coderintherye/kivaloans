He is single and he lives with is mother. He sells chickens. \r\n\r\nHe started out his business with his mother's help. She has always sold chickens as a business. He has no fixed work schedule. The challenge he faces is the deficiency of funds to purchase building materials to build another chicken coop, for which reason he requests a loan. He will purchase wood, nails, aluminum sheeting, chicken feeders, and to purchase more chickens. This initiative will help him expand his farm and it will translate into greater sales. He always faces the risk of having his chickens fall ill. His aspirations are to have a large chicken farmer and to be a wholesale distributor. He wishes to keep working and to support his mother and improve the family's living conditions. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":592803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase wood, nails, aluminum sheeting, chicken feeders, and chicken livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito, San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":23.06},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":23.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":24.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":26.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":27.71},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":28.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.7},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.94},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.7,"local_amount":20.7,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172162999,"comment":null},{"amount":22.37,"local_amount":22.37,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":22.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458879,"comment":null},{"amount":21.8,"local_amount":21.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":21.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182596922,"comment":null},{"amount":22.66,"local_amount":22.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":22.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181652,"comment":null},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.03,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":0.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474486,"comment":null},{"amount":212.44,"local_amount":212.44,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":212.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900276,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T21:21:15Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227572,"name":"Dionicio Rostico","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\t\t\t\nEl Sr. David, se dedica a la actividad de trasporte publico, viene trabajando hace 8 a\u00f1os en el rubro  de transportista y a la vez trabaja en un  radio m\u00f3vil de la ciudad  de Santa Cruz, que queda ubicado por la radial 11 ,naci\u00f3 en la ciudad de Sucre, el trabajo que desempe\u00f1a de transportista  lo aprendio desde muy joven ,sus primeros pasos lo realizo  en la ciudad de La paz ,trabajando como chofer de micros .Hoy en d\u00eda tiene su propio  autom\u00f3vil,  Con el cr\u00e9dito que se le esta otorgando   lo establecer\u00e1 en la compra de material de construcci\u00f3n para su vivienda desea ampliar su casa y dar mas comodidad a sus hijos.

Lucinda makes and sells fast foods such as hot dogs, hamburgers, sausage and fries, and shish kabobs, to which she adds the most delicious sauces that she herself learned to make in 1993, when she had a general store. \r\n\r\nAt her current business she works from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. She says that the sanitary, delicate, and flavorful way in which she prepares her food and the friendly service she provides to her customers are what sustain her business--that's why her customers don't buy from anyone but her. Her small company consists of Lucinda, her husband, and three employees. She buys her ingredients every Thursday so that her products are very fresh. She's received 14 loans with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo over the course of the last 17 years, which have helped her improve her sales, renovate her home, and improve her family's quality of life so that they're happy and are able to remain together.

The members live in different parts of the city of Cuenca.  This city is the third most important city in Ecuador, and has great architectural and cultural treasures, a varied cuisine, and very warm and friendly residents.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela Lucia B. lives near the polytechnic university.  This is her second loan from the foundation; it was her sister who invited her to join the communal bank.  The loans are very helpful for her business.  \u00c1ngela makes a living selling Avon products, and has been involved in this activity for one year.  She doesn\u2019t have a fixed work schedule, but sells her products to her friends and family.  She also makes a living doing domestic chores, an activity that she has performed for 15 years.  This job doesn\u2019t have a fixed schedule either, since all that her employers ask is for her to do her work responsibly.  \u00c1ngela is 34 years old, married, and has 4 children, ages 18, 16, 13, and 11.  Her oldest daughter works and helps her financially, while the three younger children study at a school in the city.  Her husband works at a body shop (he repairs the car bodies).  The family doesn\u2019t have its own house and lives in the home of \u00c1ngela\u2019s mother, though they are not dependent on her.  \u00c1ngela\u2019s new loan will be invested in more cosmetics.  Her dream is to have a house of her own.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Eugenia M. lives in the center of the city of Cuenca.  She is 49 years old, and has been separated from her husband for 2 years.  She has a 24-year-old daughter who is studying to be a veterinarian at the university.  They don\u2019t own their own home, but live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda makes a living cleaning houses.  She started working in this activity when she was very young and it has helped to get her family ahead.  For the past 2 years she has also made a living raising guinea pigs, which she sells at her home.  She is on her second loan with the communal bank and will use it to invest in purchasing more guinea pigs.  Mar\u00eda wants to help her daughter complete her university studies, and her dream is to have her own home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva

The members of the Bellavista Communal Bank conduct their meetings here.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe staff of Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR had the chance to speak with Sra. Ana Karina M., the founder and president of this Communal Bank.  She is 32 years old and has been married for 15 years.  Ana and her husband have three precious daughters who are her reason for living.  She is studying for a degree in Education at the Technical University of Manab\u00ed and expects to graduate in December.  Ana divides her time between her work and taking care of her home, which includes looking after her children, who are still young and require a great deal of attention.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, she spends time operating a retail business in addition to her teaching job.  She sells several products including shoes, women\u2019s clothing, and merchandise made by Yanbal (a company that offers beauty products, perfumes, and other accessories through catalogs).  Ana sells by taking orders and offering her products door to door.  She has many established customers, which include her co-workers.    \r\n<p>\r\nAna says she had difficulty at first because she had little money left over after buying large quantities of merchandise.  Forming a Communal Bank with the other ladies in her group has been a great help to her as well as the rest of the members.\r\n<p>\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy shoes since she has many orders for this type of merchandise.  Ana has had other loans through Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR.  She enjoys working with the Institution because of the ease in securing credit.\r\n<p>\r\nAna\u2019s goals are to graduate with her degree, continue with her profession, gain experience through her job, and improve the quality of life for all of her children.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":592841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-31T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":385,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113577,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":38.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407307,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":38.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407308,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":38.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388417,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":38.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388418,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682854,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421991,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T03:19:28Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227609,"name":"Joe Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joe Ann B. is from the village of Kinangay Sur, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

D. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Gwaan, Brgy. Balaring, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: dressmaking, fish vending and RTW businesses. Her husband Eduardo D., who is 59 years old, works as a fisherman and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children aged between 13 and 33. \r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosemarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 9000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing 19000 PHP, for a screen for the house and to buy more clothes to sell so she can continue to save for the future and have her own dress shop someday. \r\n\r\nRosemarie D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Doris, she says she has been married for 21 years.  She has three children, two of whom are adults and the other is a beautiful baby who she adores.  Doris and her family live at the home of her in-laws because they are elderly and not able to care for themselves.  Several years ago, her husband was in a serious car accident and is not able to work.\r\n<p>\r\nDoris says her situation was very difficult because she did not have any money.  A friend convinced her to start selling products manufactured by Yanbal (a company that offers beauty products, perfumes, and other accessories through catalogs).  She has done this for several years and says that she has done very well.\r\n<p>\r\nDoris sells her products door to door in the evenings and also through orders from her customers.  She says that she often buys products when they are on sale.  Doris purchases them at half price and then sells them at regular price to generate more income.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy more products that are on sale.  Doris is a founding member of her Communal Bank and is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR for the support it has provided during all of her difficult moments.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to have a house of her own and provide her children with a good education.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":592850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase cr\u00e8mes, perfumes, costume jewelry, and Yanbal cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-31T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Normita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113579,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407311,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407312,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388421,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388422,"comment":null},{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682856,"comment":null},{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T01:46:41Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227619,"name":"Carol's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carol G. is from the village of San Antonio.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional products to sell and is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell.

Juditha is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Juditha from GDMPC.

With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Salvacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15600, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20000, which she intends to use for the purchase of fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and for the education of her children. Salvacion A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Manan-ao, Barangay Ticad, Bantayan, Cebu City. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fruit vending, pig fattening and carpentry businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. Basilia is now borrowing PHP 17000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Basilia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Nylonshell, Brgy. Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: general store, fishing and videoke businesses. Her husband, Rodolfo, who is 53 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 23 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nCandelaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing  25,000 PHP which she intends to use to pay for raw materials for a new business venture and the videoke machine which she currently leases so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her businesses and improved living conditions. Candelaria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

New Barbacan, Roxas, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store.  Nellie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to something better for her family. \n\nWith the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nellie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy more goods to sell in her general store so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion.

Tumarbong, Roxas, Palawan. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: hog raising, manicure\/pedicure and food vending businesses. Annalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase additional piglets, pig food and vitamins so that she can continue to save up for the future to have her own piggery and for business expansion. Annalie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, to epic mountain passes and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is a farmer dedicated to the production of potatoes, carrots and turnips for more than 15 years. He is married with six children. His wife is the housekeeper and his business is the sole source of income for his family. His harvest is about to be dug up so he is requesting a loan of 13,000 Somoni to acquire agricultural products such as seed and mineral fertilizer to be applied to his crops. Maksudjon wishes to improve his living conditions and hopes to do so from the income that his harvest will bring.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, to epic mountain passes and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have four children who are between four years and 12 years old. \r\n\r\nOlivia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and to open a sari-sari (general) store.

P. is from the village of Northern Pob., Calamba, Misamis Occidental. She is 33 years old. Hazel is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Hazel owns & operates a business selling cosmetic and fragrance products. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling cosmetic and fragrance to  local community members. Hazel has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Hazel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hazel is requesting a loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the first loan taken out by Hazel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. R. is 29 years old, married and supports her family by operating three business ventures: furniture making, food vending and a piggery. She lives in Prk. 2, Brgy. Tumarbong, Roxas, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her furniture making, food vending and piggery businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,200. \r\n\r\nMichelle is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase new equipment. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Michelle aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Sampaguita, Brgy. Su-ay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: general store, buy and sell (charcoal) and hog fattening businesses. Her husband, Luis, who is 50 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have nine children who are between 11 and 28 years old. \r\n\r\nJoelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1989 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store and for food for her hogs so she can continue to save up for her children's future education and for house renovation. Joelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Y. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Matambok, Brgy. Mandalupang, Manjuyod, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and an Easy Ride Operator (transportation) business. Her husband Jimuel Y., who is 37 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 5 and 8 years old. \r\n\r\nJennifer joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jennifer has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing  19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nJennifer Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ester joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ma. Ester is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ma. Ester from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

C. is 51 years old and married. She  supports her family by operating 2 business ventures:  used clothing and ready-to-wear (RTW) businesses. She lives in Brgy. Tugas, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. \r\n\r\nRedela has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her used clothing and RTW businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6400 PHP. \r\n\r\nRedela is now borrowing 19,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Redela aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

B. is from the village of Rizal.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Delia has been engaged in her business for over 18 years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP per harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Delia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. Delia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Delia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate  translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Victoria. She is 43 years old, married, and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she plants and harvests a variety of vegetables to sell. She has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately $100 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Edna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Edna is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to pay for services to increase her crop yield. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

B. is from the village of Cabisera II. She is 37 years old. Feliciana is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Feliciana owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Feliciana has been engaged in her business for more than 14 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Feliciana joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Feliciana is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Feliciana from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She started her business as a local coal and firewood market in 2003. She purchases her firewood from the same local market where she resells it so there are no transportation costs. She also began another business in May of this year where she sells used clothing. Her firewood sales increase during winter time.\r\n\r\n She is a friendly and hardworking person who says \"I hope to one day save up enough money to expand my used clothing business.\" Uranchimeg is

She lives in her own home together with her two-year old daughter Danitza. Her greatest wish is to improve their way of life. Zulma's grocery store was the first to open in her district. From 6 in the morning her doors are open and ready to welcome any early morning buyers. Customers know of the wide variety of products she stocks in her store so they don't hesitate to visit and they always know that they can find what they are looking for. She very much enjoys the company that her clients provide her in her store, reason for which she wants to keep up her business.

The majority of the group lives in the state of Hidalgo. The group is made up of 10 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaribel Nava R. is the president of the group. She is 26 years old, she is a single mother, and she completed grade 9. She is a secretary and she has 2 children (a boy and a girl). She sells shoes through a catalogue. Maribel has been running her business for 1 year and she requests a loan to purchase new catalogues so that she might improve her sales and save money. In the future she hopes to have a store where she will find better success, so that she might always provide for the needs of her fmaily. She wants to live without worries and without ever having to secure other paid work. \r\n\r\nThe members have commented that Maribel Nava R. is an excellent salesperson, visiting her neighbors and her colleagues. She is a very hard working person, very kind, and of a excellent personal demeanor. She really enjoys her work. When she requested her loan Maribel felt very fortunate to have been given the opportunity. With the increased earnings from her shoe sales she will be able to take her kids on a holiday for one week in Acapulco. This will be making her kids' dream a reality. \r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe Raya J. is the treasurer of the group. She is 26 years old and completed junior high school. She lives together with her partner and she has 3 children (aged 10, 6 and 3 years old respectively). For the past 8 years she has been selling hand knitted handbangs, with stone and aluminium bead work in different designs. She requests a loan to invest in the purchase of materials such as threads, colored beads and high quality colored stone beads. She will be able to sell more and in less time. She goes to different municipalities, but at first she only ever sold to her friends and family. But slowly she started visiting the markets in the municipality of Tizayuca. Her clients indicate that she is a very kind person, always offering good service and a good variety of hand bags. She offers flexible payment options (weekly payments or in cash) depending on the client's needs. She feels grateful for the support offered to her through this loan and for the opportunity to get ahead, especially for her family. She helps her husband with the household expenses because his source of income is insufficient. She was initially given support by her parents who helped her improve the quality of products that she sold.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

She is a Mom and a very unpretentious and hard working person. She lives in her own home together with her husband Martin, 37 years old, and their 3 beloved children, to whom she hopes to provide a better education. With a great deal of work Jesusa has managed to work her fields and make them very productive. She cultivates bananas and coffee and she later sells the harvest in the city of La Merced. There she sells in wholesale. Her harvests have provided them with the necessary income to support the family and so she enjoys investing all her energy in her business. What she most enjoys about her work is caring for the plantations. She has worked in business for the past 8 years. The most difficult part of her work is having to transport the harvest all the way to the city of La Merced. The sacks she carries are very heavy and tire her very much. In time she hopes to purchase more land to increase her production. This is her fourth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She has been very punctual with her previous loans and she hopes to keep up her record. Within her community group she is a very involved member, always aware of the groups business and agreements.

She has always worked hard to help her family get ahead.  She started 18 years ago as a street vendor, selling picarones (a fried Peruvian pastry made from potato, wheat and honey), in order to improve their quality of life.  She says that the business is mostly worry-free, but it can be exhausting at times.  She starts work in the afternoon, after she finishes her work around the house, by making dough for the picarones because the dough has to be solid before it's fried in the evening.  When she's ready to sell the picarones, she loads the equipment that she needs in her car and carries everything to a street corner near her house.  She often works until midnight because she wants to sell all the picarones that she has made for the day.  The earnings from the business allow her to help her husband with household expenses.  Ceferina is an enterprising woman so she naturally wants to expand her business and improve it so that she can draw in more customers and serve them better.

Still others produce and sell things like pastries and apparel.\r\n \r\nRosa is the treasurer of the group. In the photo Rosa can be found in the third row and third form left to right wearing a red jacket and her hair is loose. Rosa\u2019s business is of apparel of various items, for example formal clothing and sport outfits, costumes and curtains, and other things. Rosa studied hemming and costumes for three years and she has made it her profession for the past 25 years. Rosa\u00b4s workshop is located in her house, where she counts on three machines and works on set orders from clients. Rosa plans to use this loan to generate more items such as the traditional Chilean outfit of a huaso y huasa chileno, being that September is the month when Chile hosts various patriotic parties. Rosa also plans to purchase some fabric to fabricate polar shirts, as she has already collected some orders for this type of material. \r\n\r\nRosa\u00b4s goal is to purchase a sewing machine that does intrinsic borders; she also dreams of one day extending out her workshop. Rosa\u00b4s motivation stems from gaining enough earnings to provide for her 12 year old son now and in the future when he decides to continue his studies. \r\n\r\nThe aspect that Rosa enjoys about working with Fondo Esperanza is the great help that she has received from her fellow group members and loan officer, also learning about money management skills. \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna.

He knows that most men his age are thinking of retiring and taking it easy, but he continues working and trying to get ahead.  Days for this hard-working man begin very early, almost at dawn, because that's when his suppliers drop off the products (chickens, eggs and a bit of beef) that he sells at a stand located in a small neighborhood market.  He says that the work is often entertaining and the business generates enough money that he has some left for savings.  He rests during the afternoon and starts again the next day.  Although his children help with household expenses, he says that he likes to earn his own money working, just as he's done his whole life.  For the future, Lorenzo wants to expand his business and buy equipment to replace the worn-out equipment that he has now.  This is his fourth MFP loan and he is committed to repaying it on time because he wants to continue working with the bank.  He is happy with his community group because he knows the members well and considers them to be responsible.  Lorenzo will use the loan to buy chickens and roosters to better supply his business and, in turn, continue supplying his customers with good products at affordable prices.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":593461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"Comprar pollos y gallinas para abastecer su puesto de venta.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T16:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":164.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":172.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":176.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":184.36},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":189.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":197.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":205.53},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":209.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.3,"local_amount":164.45,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154570,"comment":null},{"amount":63.08,"local_amount":172.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":176.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449882,"comment":null},{"amount":64.8,"local_amount":176.73,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":181.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588584,"comment":null},{"amount":67.6,"local_amount":184.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":188.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725086,"comment":null},{"amount":69.63,"local_amount":189.9,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":194.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463186,"comment":null},{"amount":72.44,"local_amount":197.57,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":202.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886592,"comment":null},{"amount":152.15,"local_amount":414.95,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":425.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326920,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T03:29:02Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227848,"name":"Norusca De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norusca tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y reside en el sector Ciudad de Dios del distrito de Guadalupe, en la provincia de Pacasmayo, esta zona es conocida porque a trav\u00e9s de ella empieza la carretera que se dirige hacia Cajamarca.

She earns her living by operating a dry goods business.  Her husband, Ceclio S., 28 years old, works as a laborer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have a 9-year-old child. Cherry joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cherry has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\n<p>Cherry is borrowing 19,500 PHP for her 9th loan, which she intends to use to pay for more inventory of dry goods to resell so that she can continue to save up for her child's future education. Cherry S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have three children who are between 24 and 29 years old.\r\n\r\nAgnes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Agnes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $275, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use purchase more stock for the general store and dry goods businesses so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and to purchase additional pigs to raise. \r\n\r\nAgnes C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Jose has been engaged in his business for over 20 years and earns approximately 40000 PHP during harvest season.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jose joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. He is requesting a new loan of 25000 PHP to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Jose from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb is a 53 year-old woman living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh. L. is the leader of a two-member group loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Y\u00ean H\u1eadu 2 nh\u00f3m 12 (Nh\u00f3m 12).\r\n\r\nL. is married and has four adult children. To making a living, she raises cattle for sale. L. has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4.000.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.496.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the second taken out by the borrower from SEDA. L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrower in the group:\r\n\r\nKi\u1ec1u Th\u1ecb M. is a 33 year-old woman who is requesting a 5.152.000 VND loan to support her business raising livestock.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA: The mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide micro-finance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nL.

S. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. S. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by S. from SEDA.

D. owns and operates a business making and selling a variety of food products in the local community.

K. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA which was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture products. K. is now requesting a new loan of 7.840.000 VND which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This will be her second loan from SEDA.

She lives in Purok Gumamela, Brgy. Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store, tricycle transport service and hog fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 12,000 PHP. Mary Ann would like to borrow 14,000 PHP so that she  can  purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her last loan was for 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.\r\n\r\nMary Ann aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a food vending business and a piggery business. Her husband, Rodel, who is 40 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 11 and 18 years old. \r\n\r\nLeah joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leah has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $140, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase a stock of ingredients for her food vending business. She wants to continue to save up for the future education of her children. Leah L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Enclaro, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a tailoring business. Her husband Franco, who is 58 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are between 27 to 33 years old. \r\n\r\nVirginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for a new sewing machine and inventory for the general store. She wants to continue to save up for future home repairs and other uses. \r\n\r\nVirginia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Su-ay, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, food-vending, and farming. Marissa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past five loans, Marissa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing  20000 PHP to purchase more inventory for her general store and for farm expenses so that she can continue to save up for future house renovations. Marissa A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":583937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Additional capital for fish selling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sinian, Baliangao Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cherry Lou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32,"local_amount":1280,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1444.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172165049,"comment":null},{"amount":16,"local_amount":640,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":722.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177460671,"comment":null},{"amount":16,"local_amount":640,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":722.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182598632,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":903.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188738176,"comment":null},{"amount":16,"local_amount":640,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":722.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191476312,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-02T20:42:06Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228012,"name":"Thuan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thuan T.

A. is a married woman who lives in Prk. VI, Brgy. Tugawe, Dauin, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  blacksmithing and farming businesses. Her husband Wilfredo A., who is 41 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are between 3 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nMindalena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mindalena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 30000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 24000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing 30000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase steel for knife blades and wood for her business.  By expanding her business, she will be able to continue to save up for the future education of her children and house repairs. Mindalena A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Arsenio has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately PHP 3,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Arsenio joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arsenio is requesting a new loan of PHP 30,000, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Arsenio from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

L. is from the village of Mandih. She is 45 years old. Aurelia is widowed and has 6 children; three of them are already married while the other three are still in school. To make a living, Aurelia owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Aurelia has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Aurelia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aurelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Aurelia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Aurelia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 33 years old. Arilyn is married and has 6 children; 4 are still studying and 2 are already married. To make a living, Arilyn owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community. Arilyn has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Arilyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Arilyn is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Arilyn from PMPC.
