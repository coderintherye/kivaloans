is a single mother of small children to whom she wants to teach the value of education as the best avenue for success.  She hopes that when they grow up, they'll be hard-working and successful so that she can be proud of the effort that she's making now to earn enough money to send them to school.  With that goal in mind, she began selling clothes to her neighbors and friends and, little by little, she's made herself known.\r\n<p>\r\nShe recently set up a small space in her house where she can store the clothes that she sells and where her customers can come and buy her merchandise.  However, she now has too large a supply of summer clothes which she can't sell because her customers are looking for clothes for the coming winter.  Rebeca is applying for a US$525 loan so that she can buy merchandise and have new stocks to offer her customers.  With your help, Rebeca will be able to help her children and show that she, a single mother, can provide the things they need.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nRebeca es madre soltera de unos peque\u00f1os a quienes ella quiere inculcarles que el estudio es la base del \u00e9xito y espera que cuando crezcan sus hijos puedan ser personas trabajadoras y que se superen para as\u00ed ella senrtirse orgulloza de que todo el esfuerzo que est\u00e1 haciendo ahorita por sacar dinero para mandarlos a estudiar vali\u00f3 la pena.

It is remarkable to see women that belong to different cultures work, organize themselves and get along so well. This characteristic particularly stands out when the Board of Directors, which consists of ladina and Maya Kachikel women, work together in a harmonious and effective manner.\r\n \r\n<P>The great majority of these women were weavers before receiving their first loan through Friendship Bridge. Many of them helped their mothers embroider huipiles (traditional Guatemalan dresses). However, with the loan they will receive from Kiva, our clients have chosen to change their path toward a more prosperous one.\r\n\r\n<P>At this time, the women of del Tul are investing their money in a variety of economic activities. For example, CarmeL. S. has been investing her loan in a toy store, MicaeL. J. in her convenience store, Rosa Ajpuac in her bakery, and Blanca U. in her candle and decorations store. Irma C. will invest in buying 300 roosters and hens, which she buys at 40 quetzales and then resells for 60 quetzales. Finally, another interesting initiative is that of Ana Sologui, who invests her money in her small parceL. (land plot) for harvesting coffee, which is then exported to Mexico and El Salvador.\r\n \r\n<P>The dreams of many of these women are centered on enabling themselves to buy a small plot of land where they can build a house or expand their respective homes, being that a small house is not adequate for their sizeable families. Delmy D. Le\u00f3n said: \u201cI would like to buy a plot because my house is not large enough for my family.\u201d Delmy has eight children. Suseth G. would like to buy two cuerdas (1 cuerda = 25m x 25m) of coffee for her son. Finally, CarmeL. told her group that she would love to buy a car to be able to work in a more efficient and less sacrificed manner and to travel. These women have a lot of hope in life and in God, being that they have been given an opportunity to succeed. It is for this reason, that they should be supported so that they may continue having that hope.\r\n \r\n<P>This picture was taken during a pre-qualifying credit reunion.\r\n\r\n<P>One of the members of this group could not attend the reunion for medical reasons. She had to go to the Solol\u00e1 hospital.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Dentro D. las muchas cualidades que tienen las clientas D. L.

Est\u00e1 caracter\u00edstica sale a relucir sobre todo cuando L.

Por ejemplo, CarmeL. S. ha estado invirtiendo su pr\u00e9stamo en una tienda D. juguetes, MicaeL. J. en su tienda D. consumo diario, Rosa Ajpuac en su panader\u00eda, Blanca U. en su tienda D. velas y adornos. Irma C., va a invertir su dinero para comprar 300 gallos y gallinas los cuales los compra a cuarenta quetzales y luego los revenD. a 60 quetzales. Finalmente, otra iniciativa interesante es L. D. Ana Sologui quien invierte su dinero en su peque\u00f1a parceL.

Delmy D. Le\u00f3n dijo: me gustar\u00eda comprar un terrenito porque L. casa ya no alcanza para mi familia.\u201d Delmy D. Le\u00f3n tiene ocho hijos. Suseth G. le gustar\u00eda comprar dos cuerdas (1 cuerda = 25m por 25m) D. caf\u00e9 para su hijo. Finalmente, Carmelo cont\u00f3 al grupo que a elL. le encantar\u00eda comprar un carro para poder trabajar D. una manera m\u00e1s eficiente y menos sacrificada y para viajar. Estas se\u00f1oras tienen mucha esperanza en L. vida y en Dios, ya que se les ha dado una oportunidad para seguir adelante.

Despite this misfortune, she has not lost her strength to push forward because she is responsible for taking care of her family. She works while waiting for the harvest. She plans to commercialize her crops at a much greater scale, but for this she needs a loan that will allow her to invest in such a project. Let\u2019s contribute to this great effort done by a mother who wants the best for her beloved family. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAsunta, es una mujer de mucho coraje y dedicaci\u00f3n que se esfuerza por lograr que sus siete hijos, a\u00fan bajo la protecci\u00f3n de su hogar tengan siempre un pan en la mesa a la hora de comer, ella es una madre diligente y desde siempre se esforz\u00f3 por otorgarles bienestar y salud a cada uno de los miembros de su familia.

M. has been in the bakery business for 7 years. So that he could provide for his family, he started working as a trainee in one of the local bakeries at the age of 16. For one work shift that usually lasted 17 hours he was only paid 6 to 7 loafs of bread, which was not enough for his family. He started looking for a space so he could open his own business. Once he found one, he started his own bakery. In the beginning, he was only baking for special orders for weddings because he was short of cash. After a period of time, when he accumulated more funds, he started producing bread for the sales on the market. Currently, his father and two hired employees, who are paid 450 somoni, are helping him in the business. Alisher is asking for additional funding so that he could increase his production.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova.

She will use the funds from the loan to buy materials for weaving.  Prior to taking out a loan, Thorn worked on a barter basis wI. a local middleperson.  The middleperson would advance her an amount of weaving thread.  Out of that thread, Thorn would give back two finished pieces and get the profit only from one.

They share their one-room, stilt house with three of their eight children.  The youngest child, a boy, studies in grade seven in the village school.<P>\r\n\r\nLike most everyone in rural Cambodia, Srun lives from the skills he\u2019s learned and applied over the course of his life.  On a 2,700 square meter plot of land he farms rice.  In a good year, of every three kilos he harvests, he keeps two to feed his family and sells one.  Interestingly, they expressed concern about the rice harvests.  Apparently, demand for snake meat has increased dramatically as Cambodia\u2019s growing economy creates an upper class that will pay more for exotic foods.  Cobra meat sells for $10 or more per kilo in Phnom Penh currently.  With fewer snakes as the natural predators, the population of mice has increased and mice are a pest that eats rice on the stalk.  Srun said many farmers in the area do not know what to do.<P>\r\n\r\nSrun also currently has two cows and would like to buy another.  He says he can make US$ 150 profit if he can raise one to maturity without illness.  His wife weaves cloth of silk, cotton and nylon thread.  She learned when she was eighteen from her older sister but only started again three years ago so she could teach one of her daughters.  <P>\r\n\r\nThey hope this loan will allow them to increase the family\u2019s cash flow.  Their primary goal is to keep the remaining son who studies, in school.  The furthest any other children advanced was grade eleven."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":93357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a

Activities include: Savings & Borrowing; Volunteer work; and raising pigs in each member's house.  In raising pigs this group so far are only doing it the traditional way, so that results are not maximal. To maximize results, the group has requested The Dinari Foundation help to work side by side with the group, provide training, besides loan to increase pig farming capital. Though Dinari's assistance the group plans to raise pigs of superior type and to buy Quality feed, so that results would be pigs at market's standard. Each group member needs capital of Rp1,100,000 (Translator's note: 1US$ fluctuates between Rp9000-9500); to buy 4 piglets at Rp250,000\/each and feed of Rp100,000. After 5 months group raising, the group will sell collectively, coordianted by administration working together with Dinari for marketing, so that the group could get best price.

Dalam pemeliharaan ternak babinya angota kelompok selama ini melakukannya denga memelihara secara tradisional sehingga dalam hasil yang diperoleh belumlah maksimal.\r\nUntuk memaksimalkan hasil usahanya kelompok ini mengajukan permohonan kepada Yayasan Dinari guna nantinya dapat mendampingi kelompok dalam hal pengelolaan kelompok dan juga pelatihan \u2013 pelatihan yang diberikan disamping pinjaman dana untuk menambah modal usaha ternak. Melalui pendampingan Dinari kelompok berencana untuk memelihara bibit babi jenis unggul dan membeli pakan yang berkwalitas sehingga akan menghasilkan babi yang sesuai dengan standar pasar\r\nMasing \u2013masing anggota kelompok membutuhkan dana sebesar Rp. 1.100.000,- dengan perincian , membeli bibit  4 ekor @ Rp. 250.000,- dan Rp. 100.000.-  untuk membeli pakan.

He also does construction work in the area.  She explained that the loan will help her by allowing her to buy weaving materials for cash rather than by barter with a middleperson.  If she works with a middleperson, she trades two of every three finished pieces just to pay for the weaving thread.  She, in turn, gets the sales price from a single piece.  If she pays cash for the thread, the cost is cheaper.  If she sells for cash, she can increase her profit by as much as 10% or more per piece.

In the beginning, she was the only one working on the market. A year after, when she accumulated more capital, her oldest son, Davron, started helping her. After obtaining her first loan from MicroInvest, she started bringing the goods from a different country, which has increased her earnings. Currently, Davron himself is selling goods on the market and Muharram is bringing new inventory. During the past two years, Muharram has been continuously taking out loans from MicroInvest and has become a very good customer.

P. has been in the business for more than 15 years. His brother and father are also involved and help him with this production. This is the sole source of income for their whole family. This business was passed from father to children. During the times when Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union they didn't have any problems with the raw materials. Currently, because the factories that produce metal do not operate, they have to acquire raw materials from neighboring countries where only cash form of payment is accepted. Because they did not have sufficient funds, they were not able to continue their production for some time. Once they found out about the microloan program, MicroInvest, they were able to obtain funding through loans and restart their production. Currently, Habibjon needs financial support to increase his production and acquire more raw materials.    \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova.

She learned about the micro-credit program at MicroInvest Tajikistan and would like to increase the assortment of goods she sells, in hope of increasing her income.  Due to the coming cold weather, she plans to widen the range of goods offered.      \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

He has been using the profit to cover family expenses and to increase the stock of meat in his store.\r\n<p>\r\nDominic is the leader of Subgroup H of group Tujikwamue Ukonga (Tujikwamue meaning \u201cprogressing from one stage to another\u201d in Swahili, and Ukonga being the location), which totals 55 members. He will be sharing this loan with his subgroup members: Amani M. (tailoring), Aminatha T. (chicken & clothing sales), Maria D. (clothing sales), Sara M. (clothing sales), Patricia P. (medicine and other sales), and Stephano M. (butchery). He knows his subgroup members well, as they are all neighbors and, as a group, have already successfully paid back their first loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the previous loan, Dominic purchased a larger stock of meat for his butchery. He is planning to use the new loan to buy more stock and to also renovate his butchery.\r\n<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":93588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"Business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2007-12-06T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominic","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminatha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-21T06:39:40Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":2450000,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":612500},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":612500},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":612500},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":612500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":612500,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":618450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119564,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":525,"local_amount":612500,"processed_date":"2008-02-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":618450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139661,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":525,"local_amount":612500,"processed_date":"2008-03-21T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":618450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":162827,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":525,"local_amount":612500,"processed_date":"2008-04-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":618450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188117,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-07T06:39:40Z","paid_date":"2008-04-21T09:12:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":26509,"name":"Gullu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gullu lives in Kirkhchirak village, in the Salyan region.
