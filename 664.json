They live together as a family unit in their own home which is located in the town of Ricrican.\r\n\r\nThis brave woman grows tubers (potatoes, oyuco and oca).  What she most enjoys is when she is able to travel down from her farm to the city where she sells her produce after each harvest.  She tells us that she is able to sell at a very good price because she takes a lot of care of her crops, always choosing the best fruit.  She travels at least once to the city of Tarma where, in addition to selling her nutritious tubers, she also sells meat from her sheep.  These sales enable her to cover the cost of her weekly food and some other incidental expenses.\r\n\r\nDedicaci\u00f3n is grateful to God for all the support that she has received and, in spite of how demanding it is working on her farm, she is happy that she owns her farm and is able to work it for her children.\r\n\r\nDedicaci\u00f3n belongs to the \"Mirando a un futuro mejor\" community bank and this is her 12th loan from MFP.

She makes millet porridge to sell. She serves it with fried doughnuts. Her business is about three years old. Esi will use the loan to purchase additional millet, sugar and others to cook to sell. With the new profits from her expanded business, Esi plans to reinvest back into the business. \r\n\r\nTo prepare her porridge, she first gets her millet, removes unwanted particles from it, and washes it.  She adds local spices such as ginger and pepper to taste.  She sends the millet to the mill to be milled into powder.  After returning from the mill, she adds water to the resulting flour to make dough. She leaves it for a couple of hours before using the dough to make porridge.

She has two daughters and five sons, and is married.  She lives in La Aldea de La Concepcion, in the municipality of Juticalpa. \r\n\r\nAlejandrina has been making and selling doughnuts and quesadillas for more than 15 years.  She learned this trade because she worked with a neighbor making the same products, and also learned thanks to several bakery courses she took at the Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP). \r\n\r\nHer business is located in her home, and still has no name. Her work schedule starts at 4:00 am, and she works with her two daughters.  They help her to prepare the dough, and then spend the time it takes for the products to be in the oven.  Once she takes the product out of the oven, she places it in a plastic container, and takes it to sell door-to-door to homes and businesses.  She thinks that her major advantage is that her products have a special flavor, and that additionally she is a friendly person who gets on well with other people and this helps her to make sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have premises in the town center, even if they are small, so that she no longer has to sell by foot and so can have an easier life, as she has diabetes and is still undergoing medical treatment.  Every time she returns to her home after finishing her daily work, she feels resentful of her health.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Alejandrina is requesting is needed by her to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter and other ingredients to make doughnuts and quesadillas.  With the help of this loan, she will be able to generate earnings and cover her medical costs.  She will also help her husband with the financial upkeep of the household, as he works in agriculture and has little income.  She also would like to make improvements to her home.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina has had several years receiving support through FAMA through the provision of loans, which she has punctually paid back and which have helped her to keep her active business going and to improve her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":862398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-09-08T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1530.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784957,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1530.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589354,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3060.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547449,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6121.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758087,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T20:52:32Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":332728,"name":"Zonia Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zonia, vive con su familia, tiene un hijo D. 8 a\u00f1os D. edad, ella administra una tienda, todos los d\u00edas esta atendi\u00e9ndola, sin un horario fijo, ella y su hijo depenD.

Her sales location is a cafe where she doesn't just sell food, but also candies for the children students who are her main consumers; this allows her to have more earnings.\r\n\r\nJulia has concrete goals for her business, and has decided to put them in place at her sales premises so that she works in better conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth time that she is requesting a loan through MFP.  In all this time that she has requested loans, initially as part of a group, she has demonstrated punctuality in making her repayments.  And on this occasion, the money will be invested in the purchase of new silverware and merchandise for her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":246.61,"image":{"id":862916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to invest in the purchase of new silverware and merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-09T01:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":104.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103.29},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":111.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":114.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":114.43},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":127.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":140.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":149.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.4,"local_amount":104.72,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851259,"comment":null},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":103.29,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":103.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666438,"comment":null},{"amount":41,"local_amount":111.82,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":111.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621592,"comment":null},{"amount":41.89,"local_amount":114.23,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835674,"comment":null},{"amount":41.95,"local_amount":114.43,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":114.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245447,"comment":null},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":124.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":124.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385499,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T04:06:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":332767,"name":"Esfuerzo Y Voluntad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Laureano es un microempresario de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, tiene 4 hijas y dos hijos, y reside en la Colonia Quimica en el municipio de San Francisco de Yojoa.\n\nDon Laureano inici\u00f3 con sus actuales negocios en el a\u00f1o de 1999, ya que junto a su esposa tenian unos ahorros y decidieron invertirlos en una pulperia y en la compra de un auto usado para ponerlo a trabajar como taxi, ya que si decidian dejar los ahorros en el banco poco a poco los irian gastando y se iban a quedan sin nada.

He is married and has four daughters and two sons.  They reside in Colonia Quimica in the town of San Francisco de Yojoa.\n\nDon Laureano started his current businesses in 1999.  He and his wife had some savings, so they decided to invest the money in a general store and the purchase of a used automobile for use as a taxi.  If left in a bank, their savings would earn very little.  They would eventually spend it all and be left with nothing.  His wife helps with managing the store while he is in charge of driving the taxi.  Their store is open from 6am to 9pm.  Laureano has learned to manage his businesses through on-the-job experience.  Thankfully, he has not had any major difficulties.\n\nThe loan Laureano is requesting will be invested in the purchase of dairy products, chicken, donuts, rice, sugar, cornmeal, coffee, candy, beans, and other necessary products that are part of the daily family diet.  With the help of this loan, Don Laureano will be able to restock his store and offer a wider variety of products to his customers.  As his S. increase, so will his earnings.  Sometimes he has cash flow problems because some his customers are extended credit for their purchases and are slow with their payments.  \n\nHis goal is to have a mini-market that is profitable so that he can provide better living conditions for his family.

She is married and has two children aged 12 and 9.  Janneth owns a grocery store which she has had for five years.  She started out selling just a small quantity of candies, cookies and bread.  When she turned 30, she stopped working as a domestic as her grandmother was looking after her children and she didn't have much time to spend with them.  She had to look for an alternative form of work which would allow her to make money and, at the same time, look after her children.  Her husband gave her a small amount of capital to invest in a grocery store business and she bought some basic grains.  When her grocery store had been running for a year, she made another investment and she has been gradually stocking it in this way.\r\n\r\nJanneth needs this loan to buy beans wholesale.

She is a very hard-working and optimistic person who lives in the village of Juan Francisco in the Concordia municipality.\r\n\r\nMarina started her grocery store 10 years ago when her husband emigrated to the United States in search of the American dream.

So, since her mother sold groceries, she helped Marina by lending her some products so that Marina could convert part of her home into a small convenience store. This is how Marina got her start. Later, when she found out that FAMA provides loans to people with small businesses, she went to their offices. After making a loan request, it was approved. With the money that she received she was able to buy more products and return what she had borrowed from her mother.\r\n\r\nMaria needs this new loan to purchase salt, sugar, pasta, rice, butter, toothpaste, soda, soup, toilet paper, coffee, sweets, bread, and other products for consumption and home use.

This way, her sales will increase and her income will be better.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business until it is a mini-market, and also to set up a stand for selling candy at night.

The daily net profit of 200 Philippine pesos (PHP) is just enough to cover the cost of daily meals and allowances for her children.\r\n\r\nAfter four years of sacrifices, Pacita was very proud when her eldest child graduated from school.  That child now works at a restaurant, and sometimes helps Pacita by givng her money for the other child in the family, who is still a high school student.\r\n\r\nPacita plans to use this loan of 50,000 PHP to buy more grocery items, such as soft drinks, biscuits, breads and eggs, to sell in her sari-sari store. She wants to generate more income so she's able to save for her youngest daughter's college education.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Pacita dreams of managing a mini-grocery in their village to make herself more financially stable.

\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and their children in the Attbougou public housing of Sikasso, in one of the popular district of Sikasso (located in Mali's third administrative region).\r\nSince Mrs. Assetou did not have the opportunity to advance in her studies, she very rapidly familiarized herself with the trade of various items and has had for about twelve years a shop in the front of her house. There she buys and sells cigarettes, candy, matches, chewing-gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, etc. She is very much in demand thanks to the quality of her products.\r\nTo meet demand from a growing number of customers, she decided to join micro-finance organization Soro Yiriwaso a few months ago. She thus is on her first loan, which will allow her to increase her working capital in order to better satisfy her customers.\r\nWith this first loan, she is planning on buying two cartons of cigarettes from different brands, five cartons of chewing-gum, two cartons of powdered milk (in pouches), five large packs of tea, one bag of sugar, ten cartons of candy, twenty packs of matches and a few egg cartons. She purchases her merchandise form local wholesalers before retailing it for cash or credit to a clientele composed of neighbors, and mostly of young people.\r\nWith this first loan, she is planning on a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA, which will mainly be used to contribute to the expenses of the family and to pay her loan's interests, with the remainder to be reinvested in the business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":270,"image":{"id":863412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy miscellaneous grocery items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-04T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assetou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882138,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699235,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655504,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874295,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283121,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":20535.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424627,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-10T04:13:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333009,"name":"Issa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9 vers 1970 \u00e0 Nimporodioula pr\u00e9fecture de Sikasso, Monsieur Issa est polygame avec 4 \u00e9pouses et est p\u00e8re de six enfants.

He lives with his wives and their children in his own house in Medine, one of the popular districts in the town of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nAfter unsuccessfully trying his hand at several businesses, including agriculture, he rapidly learned the business of stocking and retailing food products such as tiger nuts, Shea nuts, and cereals, in which he started ten years ago. With such an experience in this domain, he enjoys a strong reputation and gets many orders from the outside, but he is lacking the resources to meet the demand. He therefore joined Soro Yiriwaso four years ago, and has benefited from four loans, which were all timely repaid.\r\nIn order to better meet his ever-growing customer demand, he is requesting this fifth loan. It will enable him to purchase 15 bags of tiger nuts, three tons of corn, seven bags of millet and eight bags of Shea nuts. He gets his supplies from the towns around Sikasso and then stocks them in his store located in the new Medine market of Sikasso, before transferring them to Abidjan and Bobo Dioulasso (respectively in the Republics of Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso) when he gets orders from manufacturers of tiger nut juice and Shea butter. As for cereals, they are sold locally, both wholesale and retail, but mostly to retailers.\r\nWith this loan, he is planning on a monthly benefit of 300,000 FCFA. With the profit, he means to address his main expenditure, his family's expenses, to pay his loan's interests and to reinvest the remainder in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":863414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase food products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-04T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Issa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":250986.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655505,"comment":null},{"amount":550,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":250986.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424628,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T17:49:02Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333010,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is a hard-working business man.

He lives in a large extended family in Kabo\u00efla II- Sikasso (the third administrative district of Mali). Not having had a chance to go on with his studies, ten years ago he launched a business buying and reselling fruits, vegetables and tubers: potatoes, oranges, lemons, sweet potatoes, melons, bananas, yams, mangoes etc. With his long experience, he enjoys a good business reputation in Bamako and receives many orders, but lacks the necessary resources to meet demand. And so he joined Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first loan, which will allow him to increase his working capital in order to meet the customers\u2019 expectations. This first loan will allow him to buy  10 bags of oranges, 15 bags of lemons and 20 bags of sweet potatoes  from villages around Sikasso. He sells wholesale and retail, for cash and on credit, to customers coming from all social segments but mostly to restaurant owners.

They live for the most part in polygamous families in MAARO, a village located 45 km away from Sikasso, the 3rd largest administrative region of Mali. They collaborate with microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to continue their agricultural activities during the winter season. This is the 5th loan they have requested from the institution; all previous loans were reimbursed without any difficulties. Mrs KADIA, who is standing in the middle of the back row in the photograph, is a good representative of the group. She plans to use this loan to cover labor costs and purchases of fertilizer and seeds for 1 acre of land.\r\nGood produced are sold at the neighboring village of LOUTANA and at the SIKASSO market to a client base of men and women. She hopes to obtain profits of 80,000 FCFA (approximately 176 USD) at the end of the season, which will enable her to pay back her loan as well as help her husband cover daily living expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":863453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase fertilizer and cover costs of labor and seeds ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Maaro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bagnon Dafe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Abdoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou Seibou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Hamidou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":455000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":455000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-03T05:55:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333030,"name":"Tobias","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tobias is a focused businessman aged 32.

He plans on using his loan to pay costs of labor, and to purchase farm input and seeds to maintain 1.5 hectares (about 3.5 acres) of corn fields.  \r\n\r\nThe crop is stored for awhile before being sold in the village of Loutana and at the Sikasso market, to a clientele made up mostly of salespeople from large cities like Sikasso, Bamako, etc.\r\n\r\nOumar hopes to make a profit of 185,000 CFA francs at the end of the growing season.\r\n\r\nThis profit will enable him to pay off his loan and also to help cover his family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":863471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase farm input and seeds and to pay costs of labor  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Zoloko","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siaka ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ousmane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dyrissa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salifou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moustapha ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aly ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-04T17:02:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333036,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nClient de 27 ans, c\u00e9libataire sans enfant, il  se lance dans le commerce en 2002, quand il arr\u00eate ses \u00e9tudes en classe de troisi\u00e8me,situe dans un quartier populaire , il a une forte client\u00e8le  il vend en moyenne 50.000 frs a 120.000frs par jour, il vend tous les jours du matin jusqu'au soir.\nA l'octroi de son pr\u00eat il va acheter des produits d'alimentation  et des produits cosm\u00e9tiques.\nTres pragmatique il a l'intention d'ouvrir une grande boutique et faire de la vente en gros et demi gros de ces produits.Il veut beaucoup epargner pour satisfaire a ses ambitions.\n   ","en":"Richard, age 27, is single and without children.
