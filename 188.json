For twenty years she has run a store in her house, which has allowed her to improve her economic situation and help cover her household expenses.  But now she has started a new business selling food, renting out a stall next to her house.  Every night she serves food to people coming to eat after a long day at work.  So after working all day in her store she goes to sell this food with the help of her son.  Together they work until midnight, exhausted by the work and wanting to sleep, knowing that the next day they will have to work at the same speed, or possibly faster. However, they continue on with the goal of being able to equip their house with air-conditioning, since they want to rent out apartments, which is considered a very profitable business in the area where they live.

K. is 25 years old and is the mother of one young child. She is married to Sokhov, age 35, who runs a bicycle and motorbike repair service in front of his house. K. owns a general store where she sells cooked ingredients, kid's sweets, and plastic and tin containers to the whole community. \r\n\r\nBecause her store is located in the middle of a busy street, K. can sell many products every day. She is a struggling mother and a responsible neighbor. To meet her family's demands, she has recently planned to increase her income based on her selling. Therefore, K. is taking a loan to buy more ingredients and more products for her store. The loan will benefit her business. \r\n\r\nThere are four other members of the loan group. M., age 22, owns a small grocery store front of his house. He is looking a loan to buy more cooked ingredients for his store. N., age 47, owns a shop where she sells breakfast food.

She wants to take out a loan to increase her assortment of goods.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Melissa Kniazeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":283893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"selling children's clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kostakoz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.198611 69.81","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-10T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhayo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3085.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015966,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T03:56:50Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T22:04:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93698,"name":"Abdumalik","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 28 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439.\u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0443 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0438.\u041e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430.\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u0441 \u0411\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c ,\u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446.\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437.\u0412\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u044a\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c , \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0435 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446.\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0438 \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0449\u0443\u044e \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442.\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443.","en":"Abdumalik is a 28 year old man, he is married and has two children.

She supplies herself from rural producers in the towns near Sikasso and then sells the goods retail, cash or credit accepted, in Ni\u00e8na and in mining zones.  Her customers are generally composed of women and especially miners.  This has to do with the washing of gold (a traditional mining process) at sites having alluvial deposits of gold.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help with family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":283977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy calebasses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":42857.14,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44820.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033711,"comment":null},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":22410.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621078,"comment":null},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":22410.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020044,"comment":null},{"amount":42.87,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":22410.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242788,"comment":null},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":22410.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678373,"comment":null},{"amount":42.84,"local_amount":21428.58,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":22410.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112450,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T15:25:32Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93734,"name":"Nawab John Mohammad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nawab baji is 57 years old and a married lady and citizen of a city named Vehari, Pakistan for the past 7 years.

His income makes her relax from work. She successfully repaid her two previous loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan and Kiva's partner).

Khalida baji wants a loan to buy seasonal fruits for her fruit-selling business. Fozia baji wants a loan to buy thread to sell. Sajida baji wants a loan to buy vehicle oil to sell.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business.

","en":"Abdurashid M., born in 1966, has a wife and three children. He has been raising animals for 9 years, but his primary work is transporting cargo between regions. Animal husbandry produces a good income, but there is a long wait for the animal to grow to marketable size. Because of that Abdurashid became a truck driver and started carrying fruits, vegetables and other freight. He began to work with Microinvest a few days ago. If conditions allow him to expand his business he will continue to request loans in the future.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":284001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-13T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdurashid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":280.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015969,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":280.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599701,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":280.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994143,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":280.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215422,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":280.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644913,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":280.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084474,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-16T04:21:49Z","paid_date":"2009-11-14T09:13:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93758,"name":"Jerilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jerilyn C. is a 28-year-old mother of two.

He has learned to raise them well so that he can market them. Hasan is married and has three children to provide for. To support his family, he has to invest in his livestock business and, consequently, he approached IMON International to apply for a loan that will allow him to purchase young cattle and fodder for feeding them. This loan will, in turn, increase his income from the sale of milk, meat, horn, etc. that the cattle provide.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

has six years of experience as a seamstress. She worked with her mother first, which is how she learned her trade. Four years ago she started her own business, and with the help of some money her husband saved, she was able to buy the sewing machine she needed to open her business. Shahnozakhon specializes in \r\nwomen's national dresses. Her workshop is in her home and she works Monday through Sunday from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm. She would like to take out a loan of $600 USD for the term of 10 months to be able to purchase new, modern fabrics for her business. Shahnozakhon is counting on your help and thanks all of you. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and manufacturing, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has lived with her partner for mO. than 10 years and has 2 children.  They currently live in the home of her elderly parents and she cares for them.  She has worked as a beautician for mO. than 19 years and 5 years ago started selling perfumes and other cosmetics, but her beauty salon is what is most profitable, since the only investment that she makes is in the styling and coloring products.  Those products also cause her pain in her hands because they contain high levels of alcohol.  Despite these difficulties, her beauty salon allows her to earn 40 to 45 soles per day, and in holiday and school graduation periods she earns 70 soles per day.  She shares her earnings with her parents and children, which is what motivates her to keep working.

En aquel entonces a\u00f1oraba poder jugar con sus amiguitos en vez de estar en la chacra, pero ahora que ya es joven, dice haberle servido mucho porque es muy  responsable y trabajador, y sobre todo, ama sus actividades agr\u00edcolas.  En este tiempo Alfonso est\u00e1 tratando de independizarse econ\u00f3micamente de sus padres; por ello que ha sembrado pi\u00f1a en la chacra de su padre, aunque esta fruta resultada ser muy trabajosa y de mucha inversi\u00f3n, ya que constantemente se tiene que limpiar las chacras, de no ser as\u00ed, la pi\u00f1a no desarrolla correctamente y si no se abona tampoco crecen de buen tama\u00f1o.

His childhood memories are of his work on the field. In those days, his parents cultivated fruit trees of bananas, oranges, avocados, coffee, etc., where he and his siblings, despite their young age, helped in all the jobs instead of playing child games. Back then, he yearned to play with his friends instead of being in the fields, but now that he's a young adult, he claims that it helped him very much because he is very responsible and hardworking, and above all, loves agricultural activites. Currently, Alfonso is trying to become financially independent from his parents, which is why he has planted pineapple in his father's farm. However, this fruit has proven to be very time consuming and requires much effort, as the fields need to be cleaned constantly, or else the pineapple does not grow correctly, and if they are not fertilized, they do not reach a good size either. Alfonso is waiting to have a good production in order to increase the coffee cultivation, because he knows that plantations of coffee trees are more profitable than fruit trees. This is his first loan with MFP, and he has been assigned as president of this new communal bank, for which he has taken an oath before the other members and committed to be punctual with his payments. The money he requests is for the purchase of fertilizers for his pineapples which require fertilization every three months in order to produce in larger numbers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia Cortina, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":284482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fertilizers for his fruit trees ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":292.32,"local_amount":899.45,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":957.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211122,"comment":null},{"amount":32.68,"local_amount":100.55,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":107.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640625,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T01:25:00Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93861,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Daniel tiene 64 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado hace 45 a\u00f1os y padre de 6 hijos; actualmente vive con su esposa y su nieto en su casa.

Together with his wife, they have worked many agricultural jobs.  Through this work, they accumulated guts and experience, learning which months are good for cultivating and fertilizing.  Since then they've arrived at the conclusion that growing pineapple is very difficult, while growing bananas is easier.  However what is really profitable, though also labor-intensive, is the cultivation of coffee.  Daniel planted this product non-stop throughout the entire year, investing a lot, but also gaining a lot.  This made him feel very proud to be a farmer.  Now he is very happy because the coffee farm he planted last year is already about to bear fruit.  For that reason he wants to complete fertilization of the coffee plants, so that they will be harvested on time and so that in this way he can have an alternate production and will have money to cover his family's expenses.

Marcial's parents grow all types of fruit and ever since Marcial was little he has helped his father out where he can. When he was 15 he became interested in carpentry so he looked for work with people who worked in this profession. He began by passing wood, brushing pieces and finally, little by little, he began sandpapering. Since then he has decided to become independent, growing his own products and investing the profits in machines and tools for his carpentry. He has been working in this way for two months but it is still not very profitable because he still does not have all of the tools he needs so it takes a lot of time to make furniture. For this reason he also works as a driver and cares for his crops, where his wife is his greatest support. With these three businesses he is able to support his family. Despite being new to carpentry, Marcial is very happy in this job because he says making each piece of furniture takes imagination and creativity.

Desde muy ni\u00f1o tuvo la predisposici\u00f3n por el cultivo de la tierra, virtud que hered\u00f3 de su padre, a quien le gustaba tener la chacra limpia de yerbas y remover la tierra constantemente para que las plantas apresuren su producci\u00f3n. Cuando Marcelino form\u00f3 su propia familia se propuso sembrar grandes hect\u00e1reas de diversos plantas (pl\u00e1tano, pi\u00f1a y caf\u00e9), en todo este tiempo en la fruta que mayor tiempo invierte es en la pi\u00f1a, cada 2 a 3 meses se tiene que remover la tierra y del mismo modo abonarla, eso le genera mayor inversi\u00f3n de tiempo y dinero; por ello ha decidido ya no sembrar pi\u00f1a, y quedarse solo con los pl\u00e1ntanos y el caf\u00e9. Este a\u00f1o va a renovar sus plantas, para ello est\u00e1 preparando una hect\u00e1rea de chacra.

La dificultad que se le presenta, generalmente, es la falta de dinero para invertir en sus cultivos tanto como el quisiera. Marcelino es un nuevo cliente de MFP, sus vecinos y amistades tiene un buen concepto de su persona, por ello que le nombraron fiscal de su banco comunal, este su primer pr\u00e9stamo, y hace compromisos de hacer efectivos sus pagos en las fechas se\u00f1aladas. El dinero que solicita es para la comprar 3 bolsas de fertilizantes, como el nitrato y potasio, que le servir\u00e1n para el abonado correspondiente de su chacra de pl\u00e1tanos. ","en":"Marcelino is 52 years old. He's been separated for two years, and is the father of four kids. He currently lives on his own at home. Since he was just a small boy, he had a predisposition for farming, a virtue he inherited from his father, who liked to have his small farm clear of weeds and to constantly turn the soil to speed up the growth of his plants. When Marcelino began his own family he decided to grow large acres (hectares) of diverse plants (bananas, pineapples, and coffee). With the pineapple, in which he's invested the greatest amount of time, every 2 to 3 months he has to turn the soil while fertilizing it at the same time. That takes him a larger investment of time and money; for that reason, he's decided to stop growing pineapples, and to work with just bananas and coffee. This year he's going to renovate his plants, so he's preparing a hectare of farmland. Marcelino is very happy with agricultural work; for him, agriculture is an art, so he must put in the necessary time. Only in that way will it become very profitable. The difficulty he confronts, generally, is the lack of money to invest in his farming as much as he would like. \r\n<p>\r\nMarcelino is a new client of MFP. His neighbors and friends place good trust in his character, so they named him financial leader of their communal bank, this being his first loan, and he agrees to ensure that payments are made on the indicated dates. The money he's requesting is intended to buy three bags of fertilizers, like nitrate and potassium, which will help him with the fertilization for his banana farm.\r\n<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Todd Schmid, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":284500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fertilizers for his banana farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-19T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":573.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640628,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T01:14:04Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93869,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el Sr. Natividad tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica al comercio, tiene tres hijos una mujer y dos varones, su esposa es maestra y trabaja en la escuela Estados Unidos de esta localidad, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su casa de habitacion asi no descuida a sus hijos.\nel negocio tiene un a\u00f1o de estar funcionando y le ha dejado muy buenas utilidades el solicita el prestamo para poder surtir mas su negocio ya que el dice que por la crisis economica desea comprar producto para terlo guardado ya que todo va a subir de precio en unos meses. su meta es poder ampliar su negocio y tener su propia bodega. a el le gustan mucho las frutas.","en":"Natividad is a 42-year-old businessman and has three children: one daughter and two sons.

Agriculture is and has always been a strong part of his life.  It sustains his siblings and the laborers who work for him in their eagerness to provide continuity to their customs and above all carry out the work of the land. \r\n<p>\r\nRobert plants in his parents\u2019 small farm, but for the past two years he has been buying 2 blocks of fruit trees and would like to acquire more land.  In this small farm, he plants coffee because he says it is more profitable than bananas, but the advantage of bananas is that they do not have to be transferred constantly and these plants last more than 10 years in full production.  For that reason he always tries to maintain them well by credible means. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the purpose of acquiring more resources, he is thinking of working in the city as a driver or perhaps setting up a business, even though it is not yet defined. But the one thing he is sure of is that he is not only waiting to have economic income from his crops. <p>\r\n\r\nRobert is very happy for having the opportunity to integrate this communal bank, and even more for knowing that there are people who make these loans possible.  He is committed to making prompt payments. This is his first loan with MFP, and they have named him educational coordinator.

She is unmarried and is self-employed. She sells an assortment of products, including small novelties, at the local market with her mother.

D. has a Poultry\/kuku business. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. She works at the business for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Naomi currently earns about 160USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy chicks to raise and resell. In the future, she plans to expand her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy thread, a sewing machine, and kangas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027601,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613602,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010681,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232967,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664758,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T20:36:45Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93982,"name":"F\u00e9lix Alexander Mej\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"F\u00e9lix Alexander M. de 39 a\u00f1os de edad reside en Cojutepeque, junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida, trabajan muy duro d\u00eda con d\u00eda, \u00e9l posee una venta de frutas y verduras en el mercado del lugar, F\u00e9lix desea aumentar las ventas de su negocio ya que esta es la \u00fanica fuente de ingresos que posee junto a su esposa.

This is 48-year-old Rose Mango from Mwanza.  She is single and has two children between the ages of 12 and 19. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because he is an orphan. \r\n<p>\r\nRose has been running a pig and poultry business since 2004. The pig and poultry business is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients. Nguruwe means pig in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. They can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide protein. \r\n<p>\r\nRose works at her business for 12 hours per day, seven days per week, and is assisted by one employee. She currently earns about $150 from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to buy more pigs. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rose thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thereby enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy more pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027602,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613603,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010682,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232968,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T17:46:42Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93987,"name":"Manuel De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuel de Jes\u00fas L., de 51 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Cojutepeque, vive junto a su hijo de 18 a\u00f1os, estudiante de tercer a\u00f1os de bachillerato y su hija de 17 a\u00f1os de edad la cu\u00e1l estudia segundo a\u00f1o de bachillerato.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Our client\u2019s business is Poultry\/kuku business. \r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\nShe works at the business for 8 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Anitha currently earns about 360USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy chicks and continue with poultry business. \r\nIn the future, she plans to expand her poultry business. \r\nAnitha thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

Hace varios a\u00f1os, el trabaj\u00f3 en una de las panader\u00edas m\u00e1s grande de Bluefields.  Despu\u00e9s, trabaj\u00f3 como pescador por unos a\u00f1os, siempre trabajando por otras personas.   Siempre hab\u00eda querido su propio negocio.  Con su experiencia en la panader\u00eda, decidi\u00f3 de empezar con su propia panader\u00eda al nivel artesanal hace ocho meses.  \n\nCada tarde, \u00e9l y algunos miembros de su familia hacen el pan para vender el pr\u00f3ximo d\u00eda.  Ahora hay demanda para pan redondo, como lo que se usa para hamburguesas.  Usan hornos artesanales, como se puede ver en este video donde Pablo est\u00e1 describiendo y demostrando el proceso que usa para cocinar el pan.  En realidad, son refrigeradoras viejas que Pablo ha modificado para usarlas como hornos, usando carb\u00f3n para cocinar el pan.  Hacen el pan en la tarde, y cada ma\u00f1ana, menos los domingos, Pablo sale para llevar los panes a varias pulper\u00edas en todos los barrios de la ciudad de Bluefields.  \n\nPablo tiene 37 a\u00f1os y es padre de siete hijos.  Aunque \u00e9l no pudo estudiar m\u00e1s que el primer a\u00f1o de primaria, todos de los cinco hijos que est\u00e1n a su cargo ahora est\u00e1n estudiando.  \u00c9l no puede leer ni escribir mucho, pero su negocio es uno familiar.  Su esposa, quien Pablo dice que es su mano derecha, le ayuda en la administraci\u00f3n del negocio y \u00e9l se la consulta en todas las decisiones econ\u00f3micas de la familia y del negocio.  \n\nEste es el primer pr\u00e9stamo que Pablo ha pedido.  Lo va a invertir en los ingredientes que necesita para hacer el pan.  Espec\u00edficamente, va a comprar 12 quintales de harina, 20 quintales de carb\u00f3n, dos cajas de manteca, una libra de levadura, y un bid\u00f3n de aceite.  \n\nPablo dice que quiere ampliar su negocio, pero sabe que tiene que aumentarlo paso a paso.  Finalmente, le gustar\u00eda tener algunas maquinas para poder aumentar su producci\u00f3n considerablemente.  Tiene muchos planes para el futuro, incluyendo haciendo m\u00e1s cantidades de pan y de m\u00e1s variedad.  Su sue\u00f1o es para poder llegar a algo para su familia.  No solo piensa en su familia, pero tambi\u00e9n dice que le gustar\u00eda ayudar a m\u00e1s gente a trav\u00e9s de contratando a otras personas para trabajar con su familia en el negocio.  En general, Pablo trabaja para llegar su familia m\u00e1s adelante.  \n","en":"Small-businessman Pablo Alfonso R. is a man with much enthusiasm, energy, and faith. A few years ago, he worked in one of the largest bakeries in Bluefields. After that, he worked as a fisherman for a few years, always working for other people. He had always wanted his own business. With his experience working in the bakery, he decided to open his own small bakery eight months ago.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon, he and a few members of his family make the bread to sell it the next day. Currently there is demand for round bread, like what is used for hamburgers. They use artisanal ovens, as you can see in the video, where Pablo is describing and showing the process for baking the bread. Actually, they are old refrigerators that Pablo has modified to use as ovens, which use charcoal for baking. They make the bread in the afternoon, and each morning, except on Sundays, Pablo takes it to small grocery stores in all of the neighborhoods of Bluefields.\r\n\r\nPablo is 37 years old and is the father of seven children. Although he wasn\u2019t able to study past the first year of primary school, all five of his children that are in his care are studying. He can\u2019t read or write very much, but his business is a family one. His wife, who Pablo says is his right hand, helps him manage the business and he consults with her on all of the economic decisions for the family and the business.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that Pablo has requested. He will invest it in the ingredients he needs for the bread. Specifically, he is going to buy twelve 100-pound sacks of flour, twenty 100-pound sacks of charcoal, two boxes of shortening, one pound of yeast, and one can of oil.\r\n\r\nPablo says that he wants to expand his business, but he knows that he\u2019ll have to grow it step by step. Finally he would like to have machines so that he could increase his production considerably. He has many plans for the future, including making a larger amount and variety of bread. His dream is to be able to make something of himself for his family. He doesn\u2019t think just of his family; he also says he would like help more people by hiring them to work with his family in the business. In general, Pablo works to help is family get ahead. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":284170,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":28,"youtube_id":"_lGy-j7HNCo"},"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"12 100-pound sacks of flour, 20 100-pound sacks of charcoal, two boxes of shortening, one pound of yeast, and one can of oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bluefields","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 -83.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":76,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T05:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35926961,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382195,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-23T07:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52888968,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110357,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531801,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-21T07:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963356,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-01T00:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98498298,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110599468,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118000946,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123839033,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128872011,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-17T09:10:16Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:47:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94032,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet Y. is a rice grower.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He has been a member of IMON International in Tajikistan since last year, and has used his loans to expand his farm. For more than 30 years, Tursun has been growing such crops as: wheat, watermelons, onions and other crops. With the loan he has recently applied for, Tursun intends to buy more seeds and fertilizer to invest in his crop. Tursun says he will use his experience to build a successful business and plans to hire at least two workers over the coming year. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bahodur would like to obtain a loan to repair his barn, and buy feed with any leftover funds. \r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":285611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Feed and sale of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T02:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahodur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":841.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644920,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":841.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T07:58:13Z","paid_date":"2009-11-14T09:13:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94096,"name":"Ural","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Since he was very young, Ural has worked in farming.

is a humble mother who, with much effort, works on her potato farm to later sell its agricultural products in the markets of the closest towns or to traders from the same area. Her responsibilities as a mother have encouraged her to pursue farming activities to continue growing the best vegetables in the area. However, she wants to increase her investment in agriculture and expand her farmland to improve the living standards of her beloved family. Let\u2019s help this mother to keep working for the well-being of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, its culture is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

P. lives with his wife and two children in Tsetserleg city, located in the Arhangay province. His children both go to kindergarten. Although his family has its own piece of land, they live in their mother's home because of its close access to the local market. Together with his wife, Tsolmonbaatar sells second hand clothing and and also transports passengers from Tsetserleg city to Ulaanbaatar, the capital. In July 2008, Tsolmonbaatar and his wife bought a freight train cargo container for 3,000,000 tugrig ($1 USD=1,570 tugrig) and converted it into a bicycle repair shop. Their daily gross income is 15,000-25,000 tugrig and the profit ranges between 7,000-15,000 tugrig a day.  They have taken two loans from XacBank (Kiva's microfinance partner in Mongolia) and paid back both loans on time.  Tsolmonbaatar and his wife put a lot of heart into their business and they complement each other in this family activity.  In the near future, they hope to have their own piece of land located close to the local market. They also hope to build a larger repair shop.  The loan will be used to purchase repair accessories and welding

is 24 years old. He just moved out with his girlfriend from his parents' home, where he used to live with his father, mother, two sisters and a young brother. He now lives in a small rental room with his girlfriend. In 2007, he started a small retail business. With his sister, he went to Ereen, China (a border city) to buy cheap clothes and sold them at profit in his small rented space in the local market.  Since May 2008, he left the retail business to his sister and started a small photo-taking business in a small rented room. He takes photos for passport, IDs, and customized photos for school and college commencements. As the business slows down due to popularity of digital cameras for most families, he expanded his service by adding a computer, where he creates various cards such as invitation cards. He also types various documents in his computer for his customers. In addition, he added a small cellphone-service business, where he uploads songs and videos for cellphones. His business does well during anniversaries and wedding celebrations. He requested a loan to buy a decent-quality camera and printer. His dream is to have his own studio with excellent-quality computer and

S.L.M.B Primary school Maroc was built primarily for Quranic reading, but was later transformed to provide English and Arabic learning. Presently, there are 20 teachers in the school and 710 pupils. S.L.M.B has always succeeded in public exams (The National Primary School Examinations- NPSE) as well as sport.\r\n\r\n<p>This is the second loan S.L.M.B is requesting from Kiva through SMT.  With a loan, some members of the staff will start small businesses while those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into them. Some of the staff members will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others will use it to pay for either their children's education or for themselves to pursue further studies, while the rest will use their loan for home building projects.  \r\n\r\n<p>Fifty-two year old Alimany K. (back row, fourth from left) is the head teacher at the school.  He was born in Roten, eight miles from the town of Magburaka.

Secondary School Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are teachers of the S.L.M.B Secondary School, Magburaka. S.L.M.B. was established in 1961 by Alhaji Sorie Kanu to provide education for the people of Magburaka and for the propagation of Islam. Today, it has a total of 616 pupils with a staff of eighteen teachers and administrators. \r\n\r\nS.L.M.B Secondary School had never got a loan from SMT before.  They heard of SMT from colleagues in other schools who have benefited greatly from SMT\u2019s services. They decided to form a group and send in an application to SMT requesting a loan after hearing these other success stories. With the loan, some of the staff members will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children's education or for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  \r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nFifty-seven year old David P. G. (second from Left) is the principal of the school.

The school was built by the Benevolent Mission in 1986. It has a total of 14 staff members and 432 pupils. \n\nThe Benevolent school staff will use their first loan from Kiva through SMT for a variety of purposes. Some will start a small business, while others will invest in their existing businesses.  As an example, John A.S. K. (2nd from right) is the Deputy Head Teacher of the school. John is married to a businesswoman and the two of them have two children together.
