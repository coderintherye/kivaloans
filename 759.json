The main activity of her family is fattening and reselling of cattle. Having started already in 1993 with as sum of 20,000 som (KGS), the farm now brings in around 7,000 som (KGS) per month. Currently Guldarbubu's farm has one dairy cow and ten sheep. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of increasing the number of cattle, Guldarbubu turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional cattle. This will enable Guldarbubu to enlarge her farm, and according to opinion this it a very good investment.

She lives with her father's family with her children and other households.\r\nNot having attended school for social reasons (conservative and religious parents), she began to do business with her parents. Her mother sold spices and her father had a store that sold grains. Rich with this practical experience, she changed by herself to run a business selling atiek\u00e9 (couscous made from fermented manioc), potatoes, and spices. She has run this business for twenty-four years and enjoys a large notoriety and customer base. She is very much in demand at the March\u00e9 Ch\u00e2teau.\r\nIn order to cope with the demands of her customers and to make more profits, she is asking for a new loan. She has been in connection with Soro Yiriwaso for sixty-six months, and has had three group loans and four individual loans which were correctly repaid. She is at her fifth individual loan, which she intends to use to buy two tons of atiek\u00e9. She stocks up in Sikasso, Bamako and in C\u00f4te-d'Ivoire. \r\nKorotimi sells for cash and on credit to customers mostly made up of women.

She spent 35 years working as a primary grades teacher and is known as a very goal-oriented, responsible and hardworking person.  Jumabubu was able to pass her love of knowledge onto her children, who obtained higher education degrees in the fields of medicine, engineering and linguistics.  Obtaining education became possible thanks to Jumabubu's family's primary business, which is fattening up and reselling livestock.  This business, started in 1990 with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS), today yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  Currently, Jumabubu's business has 4 dairy cows, 15 heads of sheep, and 9 heads of goats.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Jumabubu requested a loan in the sum of 133,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional livestock.  This will allow her to expand her business and increase livestock headcount; thus, in her opinion, making the best investment of capital.  In the future, Jumabubu wants to build a large house for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":984986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Emgekchil village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":133000,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":19000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":407.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T16:25:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381952,"name":"Gulchehra","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u0447\u0435\u0445\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0410. \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043c\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0415\u0439 39 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043d \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043d. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u043c \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0447\u0435\u0445\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435.

He lives with this wife and their children in a large traditional extended family in Fama, one of the urban regions of the town of Sikasso (the third largest administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Having tried his hand at several activities without success, he turned his hand to the rearing of poultry in 2008. He has a farm not far from the town of Sikasso, where there are hundreds of birds (chickens, guinea fowl, geese, turkeys, pigeons etc). He is much sought after by his customers for the quality of his poultry, which are of a high standard and properly overseen by qualified veterinary professionals. In order to satisfy his growing customer base, he decided to approach the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, where this is his first individual loan. With this first loan, he plans to purchase 50 chickens, 5 guinea fowl, 5 brace of turkeys, 5 brace of duck, 4 brace of geese, plus medication and feed for his poultry flock. He does his purchasing in the villages surrounding the town of Sikasso.

He was accepted to the Yerevan Zoo Veterinary Institute after finishing a village secondary school.  Yervand is married and has two sons.  Both of his sons live in Yerevan and work as rescuers for the MES (Ministry of Emergency Situations).  Yervand's wife works as an Armenian language teacher at a secondary school, and Yervand works as a secretary at the village administration office.  Yervand has been involved in agriculture in the Aghvani village since 1998.  He grows potatoes and beans for sale on his plot of land.  He also keeps bees and sells honey in the city of Kapan.  Yervand says that beekeeping is a fairly difficult business, but it brings in a good income, and this is why he wants to increase the quantity of beehives.  Thanks to his agricultural business, Yervand supports his family because salaries are often not large enough to provide the family with all of the necessities.  Yervand needs a loan in the sum of 300,000 dram to purchase 6 new beehives and also to purchase frames for honey, wax and new speciality clothing for the beekeeping business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":66.96,"image":{"id":985085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase 6 new beehives and also to purchase frames for honey, wax and new speciality clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yervand","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":23310},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":23630},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":23710},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24060},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24310},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24770},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":24910},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25570},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25890},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":26190},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":26680},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":26970}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.96,"local_amount":25919.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":26043.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404942,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T10:02:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382009,"name":"Eileen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eileen is aged 44 and married with  six children with two still attending school.

Previously, she worked for a company, but Luz Adriana didn't really like working for this company, because she did not feel that she was able to serve people as she would like.  In the company, they were more about making profit than serving people.  For this reason, she decided to leave this position and continue to work independently.  Now, Luz Adriana offers nursing services in people's homes, and in this way she feels that she can help more people.  Her customers state that her services are excellent compared to the services offered in the hospitals, and so they always seek out her services instead of going to the hospital.  Luz Adriana has always had the dream of being able to impact the lives of other people, and for this reason, she wants more people to be able to take advantage of her nursing services.  The problem is that many times people need her services, but because of their location she is not able to accept the work.

When she was 14, she decided to become a retailer, and had two initial experiences which led her to undertake her business venture of a store.  Today her store sells food, personal grooming products, and in general all the specific items a family needs.  She sells to housewives who meet together, chat and make their purchases at Nevys' store.\r\n\r\nNevys is an entrepreneurial young woman who generates income through her initiative.  She has managed to move ahead in life in spite of being orphaned, and so has supported her family and managed to keep her business going.  She plans to see it grow permanently, and for this reason she works on a daily basis with maximum determination.  \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she has come for a Kiva loan; her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan, she will purchase a greater quantity of food, beverages, personal grooming products, and paper goods, which are what her customers normally look for at this first school season of  the year.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have a house where she can use all the technology and modernity of her youth in her business.  In the meantime, she strives to work, and with her work she earns an average profit on her sales of not less than 28%, her inventory turns over every two weeks. and her accounts receivables is at 5 days.  This is because she sells the great majority of items for cash, and provides credit to only a few, profitable customers with whom she has good relations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":93.39,"image":{"id":985247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase a greater quantity of food, beverages, personal grooming products and paper goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nevys Johanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166546},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":172096},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":176112},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":180221},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":184426},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":190599}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.39,"local_amount":166546,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":171501.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325111,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T08:03:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382116,"name":"Fredrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fredrick is a resident of Mombasa, Kenya.

She has been working with 'Bancos de Emprendimiento' since 2006, in the group PIO XII. She is one of the most responsible members of her group. Adela lives in the area of the municipal district. In her family there are three members, her two school aged children and herself. More than a year ago she separated from her partner. She has a small restaurant out of her home where she cooks lunch and on Wednesday thru Sunday nights she makes 'silpanchos' [a traditional Bolivian dish that consists of rice, boiled potatoes, a thin schnitzel-style meat, chopped tomato, onion and parsley and topped with a fried egg]. Monday and Tuesday mornings she provides cleaning service to a business, and for the small amount of time makes a good income. Right now she wants the money to buy a refrigerator and other items for her business and to buy supplies at wholesale.  This is why she has asked for the loan and she is very happy and grateful to the institution for providing support when she needs it the most. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":25.59,"image":{"id":985257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase appliances (refrigerator) and supplies at wholesale\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T21:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela Paulina \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":49.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":60.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":70.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":76.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.59,"local_amount":25.59,"processed_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263295146,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T00:52:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382121,"name":"Edilia Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edilia del Socorro es una persona que se ha caracterizado entre sus familiares, amigos y clientes como una trabajadora que siempre se quiere superar.

The number of kilograms they buy depends on the quantity of products they are going to make, so they calculate their purchases precisely.\r\n\r\n2. Cut the fibers\r\n\r\n3.

She achieved this through her free and independent spirit, generated by her own creativity.  She initially worked for an important city company.  To make more money, she made clothes for her coworkers with her mother's working tools, taking their measurements, and helping them to buy the right fabric as well as supplies.  In the year 1998, she decided to create her own company and resign from her job.  This is how it has gone, with her savings and the sales of her products she has managed to negotiate more customers from the ones referred by purchasers until this moment.  Today, she not only makes things from measurements, from contracts on credit for her best customers, but also has contracts with elementary and high schools.  She also has customers in the north of the city that recognize the quality with which she works the clothing garments and her delicate design.  She is currently applying for her first Kiva credit, and also her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to buy wholesale fabrics with it, because she has a contract with a high school to make uniforms.  With the loan, she will continue in her goal of growing and enlarging the capital of her work, so that she can continue generating a better wellbeing for her family, made up by her 14 year old son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":43.44,"image":{"id":985270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"buy wholesale fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":77462},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80102},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81971},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83883},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85841},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87844},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89893},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91991},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94137},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96334},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":98582},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":101960}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.44,"local_amount":77462,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":79767.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325112,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T15:02:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382132,"name":"Mercedes Del","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes, vive en casa propia junto a su nieta de 17 a\u00f1os de edad, ella hace 15 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de zapatos, ropa y venta de oro el negocio lo comenz\u00f3 por iniciativa propia no tiene un horario establecido.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo lo necesita porque es la \u00e9poca de los \u00fatiles escolares y quiere comprar mercader\u00eda como: mochilas y zapatos el cual le permitir\u00e1 comprar por mayor de esa manera lograr mejores ganancias y tener variedad para ofrecerles a los clientes.\nLa aspiraci\u00f3n de Mercedes es tener el negocio en su casa ya que por el momento no tienen un lugar establecido y seguir trabajando con nuestra instituci\u00f3n para tener un buen recot crediticio.\n","en":"Mercedes lives in her own home together with her 17-year-old granddaughter.

He\u2019s a bricklayer\u2019s assistant, that is to say, he works building houses.  They had three children together who are 9, 8 and 6 years old.  All of them are attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth cycle Susana has taken a loan out in and she\u2019s satisfied with the results she\u2019s gotten.  On this occasion she\u2019s asking for the loan to invest half of it in the purchase of three sheep to raise and put out to pasture and the other half to buy yarn, needles, hooks, etc. to make tablecloths, vests, mats, sweaters and other knitted items.  This is the first time she\u2019s going to experiment with raising sheep at home.  She\u2019s attracted to this because she knows that if she takes care of them and causes them to fatten up she can sell them later on.  \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to invest your money in something so that when you need to sell your assets you recover your investment,\u201d says Susana.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the textiles, she has two years\u2019 experience.  This is her successful business because she says that she knows how to do it very well and what better thing to do than to put it into practice.  The way she makes these textiles is the following:  With a knitting needle.  \u201cLike any activity, knitting also requires much patience and dedication.  The \u201cganchillo\u201d is a method for knitting with yarn or thread using a hook and a ball of yarn.  One usually holds the hook in the right hand but even left handed people can learn to use the hook by just inverting the instructions.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo begin, make a slipknot.  \u201cPull on the thread of yarn in the center of the ball.  You pull a bow of about 12 to 15 centimeters from the end placing said end in front of the ball of yarn and then we let the rest of the end of the yarn to fall slightly behind the bow.  The hook is introduced through the bow.  The yarn is gathered behind the bow with the tip of the hook.  We pass it through the front of the bow.

Desde entonces, Elmer Jaime trabaja en fincas cercanas de su vivienda y poco a poco fue trabajando en su finca en una cosecha de caf\u00e9, yuca y pl\u00e1tano. Gracias a su buena experiencia en la actividad de la cosecha, adquirida mientras trabajaba en fincas, Elmer Jaime logr\u00f3 que su cosecha diera unos productos de excelente calidad, por lo que hoy se dedica por completo a la actividad de la agricultura con su cosecha de caf\u00e9 principalmente y la complementa con una cosecha de yuca y una de pl\u00e1tano. Elmer Jaime, actualmente con 50 a\u00f1os de edad, casado y con 2 hijas de 7 y 13 a\u00f1os, obtiene los ingresos con los que sostiene a su familia gracias a su trabajo en la agricultura, y sue\u00f1a con que sus cosechas sigan creciendo para que en un futuro sus hijos puedan tener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica. Elmer Jaime busca que su cosecha de caf\u00e9, que es la que mayores ingresos le genera, pueda dar productos de excelente calidad para poder venderlos a un buen precio, sin embargo, la temporada invernal ha hecho que sus cosechas se deterioren un poco y se vea en la necesidad de comprar abono para las mismas.

His father abandoned his mother, sisters, and brother when he was 13, and since his mother was in no condition to work, he and his brother felt obliged to take charge of the family obligations.  Since then, Elmer Jaime has worked on farms near his home, and little by little he worked on growing coffee, yucca, and bananas on his own farm.\r\n\r\nThanks to his good experience he acquired working on the crops, Elmer Jaime managed for his harvest to produce some products of excellent quality, which is why today he devotes himself completely to farming, principally with his coffee crop, complemented by yucca and banana crops.\r\n\r\nElmer Jaime is currently 50 years old and married, with two daughters, ages 7 and 13.  He earns the income with which he supports his family thanks to his work in agriculture.  He dreams that his crops will continue growing so in the future his children can have financial stability.  Elmer Jaime is looking for his coffee crop, which is the one that generates the most income for him, to give excellent quality products to be able to sell them at a good price.  However, the winter season has caused his crops to deteriorate a bit, and made it necessary for him to buy fertilizer for them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Elmer Jaime currently does not have the necessary capital to buy the bags of fertilizer he needs.

Now he is working hard to be able to offer his wife a better quality of life and to have a quiet retirement.  Segundo's work is repairing and maintaining air conditioners.  He generally works with a few public and private institutions, but when he's not working he's usually at home fixing things.  He's always waiting for his cell or home phone to ring because when it does it's because a customer needs him to go to his house or office to repair an air system.  He has been in this business for 31 years, during which he has gained experience and improved his technique.  He likes his work a lot because it allows him to have free time to spend at home and it also makes him good money because in his area the heat is intense and there are a lot of air conditioning systems, which mean a big market for him.

He is married to 51-year-old Mar\u00eda and has five children, four of whom are grown up and live independently.  Only 15-year-old Carolina still lives with them.  The family live together in their own home and Arquimides works hard to provide them with a better quality of life.  Arquimides' business is farming.  He grows bananas, rice, cassava and other crops.  He owns his own farm where he works the soil and prepares it well so that he can obtain better fruit and produce at harvest time.  He has been in this business for 15 years and he still recalls that he suffered a lot when he first started his business because he needed to put in a lot of effort and hard work.  Eventually he was successful and he feels that it is much better to work for yourself than to work for other people as he did in the past.  When he works on his farm, Arquimides has the help of people that he hires and others who help him unconditionally, for which he is very grateful.  He is preparing to carry out new projects and gradually expand his farm.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Arquimides' 13th loan from MFP.  He hopes to receive your cooperation so that he can continue achieving his goals.  He pledges, once again, to make his repayments on time as he has done with his previous loans.  He will use the sum that he has requested to buy manure, to fertilize his land.  He will also buy cassava root so that he can sow his crops and thereby start a new production cycle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.23,"image":{"id":985611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cassava root and sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T22:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arquimides ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":152.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":174.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":183.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":152.81,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":154.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246290,"comment":null},{"amount":56.93,"local_amount":151.81,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":153.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386299,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T00:27:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382273,"name":"Siatunuu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siatunuu is 22 years old.
