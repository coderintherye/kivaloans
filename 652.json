Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She brings up two daughters; the first daughter goes to school and the second is preschool age (under 7). In order to earn money to meet the family needs, Aida breeds cattle; her brother helps her in running the business. He resells the cattle on the cattle market, which works on Wednesday and Sunday. In this way, he earns about 5,000 soms per month. This profit made it possible for Aida to open a canteen near the university, where she prepares and sells food. Her monthly profit from this business is 7,000 soms. Aida applied for the loan because she needs additional financial funds to purchase a calf for breeding, fattening and further reselling. In the future, she wishes to expand her business and then purchase a piece of land to start building a house.\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From? <\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She currently lives with the youngest of her 6 children. Since she was a girl she has always been involved in agriculture. She plants a few vegetables but primarily she cultivates potatoes and corn, which produce the best selling harvest. She works every day but with the passage of the years she has also seen that it is more profitable to buy and sell livestock. This has been a business that she has had for the past 5 years, while she waits for the harvest to be ready. She sells on the weekends at the farmers fair. Whatever she doesn't sell she takes back to her stable and she uses for her own consumption. During these years of work she has seen that the sale of livestock runs fewer risks and earns greater profits. Therefore her goal is to increase her working capital. This is her eighth loan with MPF (Kiva Field Partner). She started out following a recommendation to work with loans so that she will profit from each investment that she makes in the field of livestock sales. Since then she has seen the great importance of having financial support in each project she sets herself out to do. At this opportunity the funds will be used to purchase more livestock because it is during this festive season of Santiago that the sales are most profitable."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":243.17,"image":{"id":847549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more livestock to take advantage of the festive season of Santiago.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T11:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":110.97},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":109.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":112.55},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":120.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":122.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":126.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":137.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":140.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.96,"local_amount":87.17,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":87.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851192,"comment":null},{"amount":40.46,"local_amount":110.35,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":111.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666368,"comment":null},{"amount":40.33,"local_amount":109.97,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":110.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621524,"comment":null},{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":112.55,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":113.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835593,"comment":null},{"amount":44.25,"local_amount":120.66,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":121.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245381,"comment":null},{"amount":44.91,"local_amount":122.49,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":123.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385468,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T17:05:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":326716,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn is 36 years old and is married with three children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a married woman with three children -- two attend school while one is still too young for school. She lives in a rental house that has electricity and piped water. Her greatest monthly expenses are food, electricity and school fees.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Evaline has operated a clothes selling business, selling from home to her neighbours and passersby.

She lives in Concepcion, a town in the \"departamento\" of La Paz.  She started working very young because she had to help her mother with various businesses: first, food sales and, later, sales of lottery tickets.  Dona Dalia now makes a living selling cosmetics door to door.  Her life isn't easy, partly because her children are in school and her former husband barely helps with school fees and other expenses, and partly because she sells on credit and her customers don't always pay on time.  She will use this loan to buy shampoos, deodorants, perfumes, combs, creams, soaps, nail varnish, eye shadow, lipsticks and other inventory.  The loan will help her stock her business so that she can provide a wider range of products to her customers.  Her biggest challenge is the distances she has to travel to sell her products.

She sells ice in bulk and \"boli\" (flavored water in small plastic bags).  This business came about as she observed great demand by the inhabitants of this municipality.  The area has tourist potential, being located by the sea and beaches.  It is also home to businesses such as restaurants and many vendors.  The area is also known for its warm climate, so inhabitants and tourists alike continually seek to cool off and quench their thirst, especially in the summer months,which is a major impact on sales.  Yolima's main customers are vendors who do not have refrigerators and often cool their drinks with ice for restaurants to purchase.\r\n\r\nAs Yolima is a young woman who is aware of opportunity, she also sells general merchandise such as shirts, shoes, pants and accessories for women. She buys the items in the city of Barranquilla and distributes them to her customers in the municipality by payment terms tailored to their needs.  She enables her customers to access the goods they need by allowing them to pay in several payments.  Her working capital is not enough to grow both businesses; the first requires a freezer and the second requires responding to her growing clientele seeking a variety of goods, and it is very difficult for Yolima to be timely. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Yolima is applying for a loan with Kiva and this is her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Ella es una persona muy simpatica y muy orgullosa de sus tres hijos porque son muy buenas personas y muy buenos estudiantes. Elvia inici\u00f3 con su peque\u00f1a pulperia en el 2005 y le dio el nombre de Pulperia Gerson, la cual atiende desde las 7:00 am hasta la tarde-noche. Su mayor ventaja es que no hay mas pulperias en la comunidad y sus vecinos realizan las compras diarias en su negocio, aunque ultimamente sus ventas han bajado ya que cada dia los productos de la canasta basica son mas caros. El prestamo que Do\u00f1a Elvia solicita lo necesita para la compra de arroz, manteca, embutidos, lacteos, refrescos, azucar, frijoles, dulces, pan, churros, entre otros. Con el apoyo del prestamo podra surtir de mas y variados productos y con ello sus clientes siempre encontraron lo que necesitan. Su meta es apoyar a sus hijos con el estudio, aunque siente un poco de temor de que al graduarse no encuentren un empleo, asi que espera que ellos se decidan a tener un negocio propio al igual que ella. Este es el primer ciclo de Do\u00f1a Elvia en FAMA y espera cumplir de manera puntual el pago de sus cuotas.   ","en":"Elvia is 37 years old and her family consists of her husband who works in agriculture and with livestock, and her three children, 2 of whom are females.  She is a very caring person and proud of her three children because they are good people and good students.  Elvia started her small store in 2005 and named it Gerson Store which operates from 7AM until dusk.  Her greatest advantage is that there are no other convenience stores in the community and her neighbors carry out their daily shopping at her store.  Ultimately, her sales have dropped due to the daily increasing cost of staple goods.  Elvia solicits a loan to purchase: rice, lard, sausages, milk, soft-drinks, sugar, beans, sweets, bread, and churros amongst other things.

She earns a minimum of 393 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

In this place, she attends to her customers with much kindness and courtesy, and they visit her all the time because of the well-cut and fashionable clothes that she personally imports from Lima. What she most likes about her work is advising her customers about the clothes that will best suit them, as this is a good distraction. She has been running this business for 30 years and thinks that the most difficult thing is having to be on her feet all day long.

In time, she would like to open a larger store where she could offer a better service to her customers.

What she most likes about her work is showing her customers what is in fashion in the different cities of Peru, as she feels that this gains her the confidence of her customers. She has been doing this work for 33 years and thinks that the most difficult thing is having to transport heavy bundles of clothes to different markets, but, even so, she is not defeated as she knows that her family depends on her doing this work. She will use the loan she is requesting to buy more clothes, and she will have to travel to Lima to select good quality clothes and she hopes to be able to depend on the support of her financiers. In the future, she hopes to have the same strength, and so she has asked the Almighty to keep her in good health so that she can keep working with the impetus that characterizes her.

She lives in her own house with her 67 year old husband, Fortunado. What she most want is to live a peaceful old age. The business she works in is selling clothes and she has a stall in the \"Gamarrita\" market in the city of San Francisco in the department of Ayacucho-Peru. Every day she serves many customers who know that the clothes she brings from Lima are good quality and in fashion so they don't hesitate to buy in large quantities. What she most likes about her work is distracting herself with each of her customers and taking the opportunity to advise them about the clothes that will best suit them. In this way, she gains the confidence of each customer. She has been doing this work for 45 years and thinks that the most difficult thing is that she has to work long hours waiting on customers. Leoncia is grateful for the support of the financiers as, thanks to their support, she is progressing and is able to afford some comforts. In the future, she hopes to have the same strength she has had in previous years as her business is her only financial support. This will be her 6th loan from MFP and she hopes this collaboration will enable her to buy the merchandise and at the same time she promises to make her repayments on time as she wants to be able to access more loans later. She will use the $375 she is requesting to buy more clothes in the city of Lima to better stock her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":208.98,"image":{"id":848854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothes from the city of Lima, to better supply her business.

She has operated a business selling jewelry and cosmetics for a year.  She sells the products in her own store.  She decided to start the business because she needed an income of her own, one that she would control and be responsible for.  She also wanted to be able to set her own hours.  She is notably persistent, a trait evident from the years she has worked already, work that she can now see bearing fruit as the value of her business grows.  She plans to continue growing the business and the revenues it generates by adding to the variety of products she sells.

Donatilda worked on her parents' land from a very young age.  With some savings that she had and her inheritance from her parents, she now owns four hectares of land which she works diligently and has managed to make very productive.  \r\n\r\nAmongst the crops that Donatilda grows are cacao, coffee and coca leaf.  She takes her produce and sells it wholesale to middlemen in the towns of San Francisco and Quimbiri.  Her crops have provided her with the income she needs to support herself and cover her family expenses.  What she most enjoys about her work is caring for her crops as she feels very happy doing this.  She has been in this business for 23 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her crops from her farm to the warehouse centers where they are dried.  For this reason, she hires laborers who help her transport her crops. \r\n\r\nDonatilda will use the loan she has requested to buy more cacao plants which she will graft and thereby profit from their fruit quickly.  In the future, Donatilda would like to buy more land so that she can increase her crops.  This will be her 12th loan from MFP and she hopes to receive this small loan so that she can achieve her goals.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loan.  \r\n\r\nDonatilda enjoys being part of her community bank because all of the members are responsible people.  She will use the 3,000 Peruvian soles to buy cacao plants so that she can graft them and thereby profit from their fruit more quickly."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":848933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cacao plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-20T06:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Donatila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T13:30:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":327075,"name":"Ma.

She is the mother of three children, the oldest is already working  while the youngest stays at home. She manages her household while operating the business. She is currently working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJoy Ann operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Joy Ann earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling individual items. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJoy Ann hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she hopes to provide the daily needs of her family and give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.
