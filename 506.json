It is located in the community of Jaloxtoc, in the city of Ayala, which is in the state of Morelos, Mexico. It consists of four members, who are women and are neighbors. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: Dolores B. V., who is going to use her loan to buy men's and women's perfumes to fill the orders she has received from catalog sales; Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Guadalupe F.

M. is going to buy soft drinks and vegetables to increase her business, which is selling Mexican snacks and clothing through door-to-door sales. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Graciela is 35 years old. She studied in the open junior high school for one year and obtained her certificate. She is married and has 3 children: Ren\u00e9 Josu\u00e9 is 14 and is in secondary school; Andr\u00e9s is 13 and is in secondary school; and Anai is 11 and is in primary school. Se\u00f1ora Graciela has two businesses; she sells clothing door-to-door and she sells snacks such as tostadas, prepared chicharrones, and tamales. She is applying for the loan to increase her business. She is going to buy soft drinks and vegetables to prepare the snacks that she sells. In her clothing business, she offers her customers shoes and clothing such as pants, blouses, handkerchiefs and skirts. She began her business a year ago. She was instructed by Se\u00f1ora Guadalupe, who is also a member of the group and invited her to join. Se\u00f1ora Graciela liked it and decided to sell clothing door-to-door. Her husband lent her the money to buy the clothing, and she remembers that when she began to sell she was very happy. Her business is important because it has helped her earn money and they are better off, and it is a help when they need to buy something. Her favorite part of her business is when she goes out to offer clothing to her customers because it is relaxing and she meets more people. She calls on 20 to 25 customers a day. In addition, she feels proud when she makes sales and has money. She uses the earnings from her business to improve her house and to buy more clothing to sell. She wants to buy a three-wheeled vehicle to use in transporting her merchandise, and she thinks she can do it with loans. Her children help her in her business. When she sells tostadas, they help her carry her things to the corner, because not many people pass by her house. The improvements that she wants to do on her house are to finish the bathroom and tile it. Her plans and hopes are that her family will live better and that her business increases. Se\u00f1ora Graciela is very happy with the loan that she will receive because it is going to increase her business. Her goals for her children are that they excel and that they study for careers so that they live better. This loan will help her because she knows how to make good use of it.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad (Reality Foundation) \"many thanks for having confidence in us and lending us the money to excel in our businesses.\" Jaloxtoc is a pretty, peaceful, united, and community-minded town.

It is located in the community of Nueva Olintepec, in Ciudad Ayala, in the State of Morelos, Mexico.  The group has 5 female members who know each other and are neighbors.  They are:\r\n\r\n** Mrs Mar\u00eda Guadalupe G. C. who will use her loan to buy milk by the crate, flour in bulk \u2013 10kg, sugar in bulk, baking tins and iron cake stands for her cakes.\r\n\r\n**  Mrs Reyna S. Ram\u00edrez who will buy corn in bulk and have maintenance work done on her three-wheeled cart (which is the vehicle she sells from).\r\n\r\n** Mrs Josefina M. S\u00e1nchez who will buy merchandise such as soap, oil, diapers, coffee, soft drinks, water and sugar in bulk to stock her grocery store.\r\n\r\n** Mrs Lucia M. S\u00e1nchez who will buy boxes of merchandise wholesale: tomatoes, serrano chili peppers and jalape\u00f1os\r\n\r\n** Mrs Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Rodr\u00edguez R. who will buy merchandise: vegetables, tomatoes, chili peppers, rice, onion, corn, oil, and soup pasta so that she can make her Mexican 'antojitos' (traditional Mexican snacks generally sold at street stands).\r\n\r\nMrs Mar\u00eda Guadalupe G. C. is a member of the group.  She is 47 years old and studied up to the third year of her secondary education.  She is married and has 3 children: Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n is 26 and works, Maritza is 20 and works and Pedro Ivan is 18 and he is studying computer engineering.\r\n\r\nMrs Mar\u00eda Guadalupe has a confectionery and desserts business.  She requested this loan so that she could stock up with ingredients such as flour, sugar, boxes of condensed milk, peaches, eggs, whipped cream, jam and chocolate for making her cakes and desserts to sell in December and January which is when people buy her cakes the most.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Guadalupe started her business 9 years ago although she learned when she was in high school.  There they taught her to make cupcakes, cakes, desserts, pineapple 'carlotas' and 'ni\u00f1o envuelto' (literally 'wrapped child', a type of jelly roll \/ Swiss roll).  She has loved making these since she was a child and her family suggested that she sell them.  She started selling 'panques de naranja con nuez' (a type of orange sponge cake with nuts).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, her husband gave her money to buy her ingredients, then she started group saving with her neighbors (this is a very informal and traditional way of saving in Mexico).  She saved up so that she could buy from large stores.  She bought by the box load which helped her to make more profit.  Her customers are her neighbors, family members and other people who her customers recommend her to.\r\n\r\nOnce a young boy bought a cake from her for another community in Cuautla.  Now there are people who travel from Cuautla to Maria Guadalupe's town only to buy cakes from her.  The business is important to her because it has allowed her to help her husband, to help her children when they were studying at school, and to contribute to household expenses.  The business also makes her feel very proud because when it is one of her children's birthdays, or her husband's or some family member of her husband's, they give them a cake and no longer buy one.  This makes her feel very satisfied indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen they once had problems at home and things weren't going very well she managed to cover their food expenses and their household expenses and she didn't have to ask her husband for any money.  Her business is popular because people always find her quickly.  They ask for \u201cLupita de los pasteles\u201d (Lupita the cake lady) and find her easily.  The challenges which she faces in her business are that sometimes she doesn't have the money she needs to stock her business.  This is the reason she left the group saving process and looked for a loan instead because she wanted to be able to buy enough ingredients to that she could sell her cakes in the months of December and January.  With the profits from her business, she invests some, pays off her loan, buys supplies and buys food.  She would like to rent premises and set up a refrigerator display case but her husband tells her to wait and he will help her.  Maria Guadalupe's husband helps her in her business.  He helps to buy the things that she needs.\r\n\r\nOlintepec is a town which is still very rural.  It is also a tourist area.  There are springs which bring forth water and the Axocoche and Colibr\u00ed spas.  The streams of these spas pass through Olintepec where their water is used to irrigate crops in the fields.\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe would like to make some improvements to her home.  She would like to plaster her house but that will have to happen later.  Her dreams are to have an established business and to have premises in a busier area, where more people pass by.  Right now she has her customers but she would like to have an established business.  The improvements that she would like to make for her children's future is for them to be able to live more comfortably and for her youngest son, who is single, to finish his studies.  She plans to achieve all this by being persistent, selling her products and doing her best.\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe is happy to know that people around the world are helping her group and have faith in them.  \u201cThanks to your support we will do well\u201d, she says.  The members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \u201cMany thanks for your support.  Thank you for this opportunity to grow our businesses and thank you for having faith in us.  We will make our repayments on schedule so that you support us again in the future.

Rowena D. is from the Barangay of Pulot, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 37 years old, married to Roberto D. and blessed with two children who go to school. To make a living, she sells snacks and runs a sari-sari (variety) store. She also receives regular support from her husband who earns an average of 300 PHP per day as a driver. She has been engaged in her snack vending business for the past five years. She earns an average amount of more than 3,000 PHP a month from her businesses. \r\n\r\nOn December 16, 2009, Rowena joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rowena is an active member of Paglaum MPC under the PDP-LP, a microfinance program that reaches out to rural communities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,500 PHP. She is now requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP as her third loan, which she will use as  additional capital for her snack vending and sari-sari store businesses. The future income from these businesses will be used to meet the family's basic needs, to repay loans, and to educate her children. She also joined Paglaum MPC because of the savings and insurance programs offered to its members. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 34 years old and married; although, she is currently separated from her husband. They have been blessed with three children, all of whom attend school. To make a living, Shiela sells fish. She has been engaged in this kind of business for the past five years. She currently earns an average of more than 15,000 PHP per month.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shiela Alona joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Shiela Alona is an active member of Paglaum MPC under the Regular Loan Program and has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP. She is now requesting a loan of 40,000 PHP, which will be her third loan. She will use the loan as additional capital for her existing business selling fish. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family (meeting their basic needs), to save for the future, to make loan payments, to educate her children, and possibly to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":652598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Additional capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"P8 Carmen Annex, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental, ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2010-11-30T02:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shiela Alona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188738745,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191476881,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195902691,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201344023,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T08:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206212167,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211287419,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216567445,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221737198,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227107488,"comment":null},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4099.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232868844,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-30T15:27:51Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T10:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253675,"name":"Saren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Saren C.

C. is a married woman who lives in Purok 5, Brgy. Bal-os, Basay, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:  hog raising, selling of palm toddy (wine), and livestock businesses. Her husband Beato, who is 54 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children who are between 14 and 34 years old.\r\n\r\nThelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,900, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy feed, medicines, and vaccines for her livestock so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of business and home repairs. Thelma C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her husband Ramil, who is 40 years old, works as a Boat Captain to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 8 and 15 years old.\r\n\r\nRose joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rose has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the food stall and gasoline sales, so that she can continue to save up for future improvement of business and for the education of her children. Rose B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

E. is a married woman who lives in Purok 1, Brgy. Culipapa, Hinobaan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  fishing and fish vending businesses. Her husband Vito E., who is 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 4 and 21 years old.\r\n\r\nMarites joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marites has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy fishing gear and equipment for her fishing boat, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Marites E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nemesia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 9th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future to provide her with more income and to support the needs of her family. Nemesia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 42 years old. Bernadette is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nBernadette is married and has two school age children. To make a living, Bernadette owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Bernadette has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bernadette joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

G. is a married woman who lives in Barangay Pi\u00f1on, Samboan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a videoke business. Her husband Eric G., who is 47 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have 5 children who are between 9 and 25 years old. One child already has a family, 3 are working and 1 is currently going to school. \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, with which she intends to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and put up an additional business(poultry). \r\n\r\nGina G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use to pay for more additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future to have more income for the family.

A. is a married woman who lives in Purok 6, Barangay Liptong, Bacong, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  livestock and a vegetable plantation. Her husband Alejandro, who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are between 5 and 19 years old. \r\n\r\nLiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, with which she intends to obtain additional capital for the livestock and vegetables plantation so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business and for the education of her children. Liza A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lynsey Maness has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,300, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use for maintenance of tricycle so that she can continue to save up for the future, to build a new house.

Looc, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: a bakery, a general store and a hog raising businesses. Her husband Danilo N., who is 59 years old, works as a baker to earn his living. They have 6 children who are between 18 to 35 years old. 4 of their children are married and 2 are currently going to school. Cynthia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cynthia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. A previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to pay for more additional working capital for the business so that she could continue to save up for future to support the expenses of the family. Cynthia N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ni\u00f1o, Malabuyoc, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a peanut products business and a fish vending businesses. She has 5 children who are between 9 to 25 years old, 1 of her children has a family, 2 are working and 2 are currently going to school. Evangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 19000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 24000, increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29500, which she intends to use to pay for the  purchase of raw materials. Evangeline T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in Prk Tagaytay, Brg. Jolomaynon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a business raising pigs. Her husband Jonathan C., who is 29 years old, works as a OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) to earn his living. They have 1 child who is 3 years old. Guillerma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Guillerma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 7000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2230. This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use as working capital  to pay for business operations.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":654756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

I. is a widow who lives in Sitio Cansusi, Brgy.Tapon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by raising hogs. She has eight children who are between the ages of 9 to 29 years old.  Myrna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myrna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,400 PHP, raising her family's standard of living.  For her fifth loan, she is borrowing  15,000 PHP, which she intends to use for capital in her business so that she can continue to save up for the future and for the education of her children. Myrna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

call him, has been a businessman for ten years. He sells fresh and frozen products at the Plateaux de 15 ans market where he has a shack. \r\n\r\nThe previous loan he received allowed him to buy products such as: garlic sausages, summer sausages, cans of peas, mixed vegetables, natural fruit juices, pots of mayonnaise, refined oils for cold dishes, and vinegar. All these products were often requested by his customers, who came to stock up in his butcher's\/fish shack. \r\n\r\nHe has had training and now understands certain aspects of business such as stock management, keeping a cash register and feasibility studies; he has also learned how to save.\r\n\r\nHis daily turnover has gone from 100,000 francs to 200,000 francs. With the next loan he is going to buy more boxes of: chicken legs, chickens to boil, hind and front quarters of meat, oxtail, pigtails, beef tripe, beef tongue and various types of fish. \r\n\r\nHe is expecting to make more profit in order to be able to open a sales point in another market. His living conditions have changed since he has not rented for two months and now lives in his own home.

When others call him for help, he goes to fix their cars.

He is a single man. He was introduced to KADET by the credit officer in charge of the Kitengela office.\r\n\r\nDaniel has been selling quarry stones for a period of 10 years and his monthly profit is Kshs 15,000.

Kiva borrower is a 39-year-old married woman and the mother of three children.

She was lucky when she opened her shop to be able to buy computers from a wholesaler at a good price. Since starting her own business, her family situation is getting better.

He has a good credit history with Al Majmoua, but needs more financial assistance to further develop his business. Therefore, he is currently seeking a loan from Al Majmoua to purchase a lift so that he can tow cars.

Esta actividad dej\u00f3 de ser rentable y el microempresario decidi\u00f3 estudiar culinaria en Barranquilla, el oficio que desde joven le apasion\u00f3. Para ejercer su nueva profesi\u00f3n, el se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 elaboraba comidas por encargo de sus amigos para fiestas y eventos sociales. Posteriormente abri\u00f3 al p\u00fablico su propio restaurante y la aceptaci\u00f3n ha sido grande, porque el lugar es acogedor, la comida es exquisita y los precios son econ\u00f3micos. La especialidad de la casa son los platos t\u00edpicos de su natal Guajira como: arroz de camar\u00f3n, productos del mar en salsa de coco y pernil de carnero asado. Este es el primer cr\u00e9dito que tramita el  empresario con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y lo invertir\u00e1 en comprar v\u00edveres al por mayor y un enfriador nuevo que remplace la peque\u00f1a nevera que tiene en la actualidad. Mensualmente en el restaurante se venden aproximadamente 1500 comidas a un precio promedio de $4.500 COP, lo cual arroja unas ventas mensuales de $6.840.000 COP. El margen promedio de utilidad en las ventas es del 46.7%, \u00e9sta cifra demuestra la buena rentabilidad del negocio. El se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 planea ampliar las ventas ofreciendo sus comidas a domicilio en  medianas empresas y ya est\u00e1 haciendo los contactos necesarios. Por la cercan\u00eda de la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o, los pedidos de comidas especiales se han incrementado considerablemente. El microempresario se define como un hombre feliz que se dedica a deleitar el paladar de sus clientes con las mejores recetas de la gastronom\u00eda Colombiana.\n\n","en":"Jose has a restaurant located in the north of the city of Barranquilla.  He is from northern Guajira Department, and until the year 2006, he sold clothes and shoes between the cities of Bogota in Colombia and Caracas in Venezuela.  The activity ceased to be profitable and this micro-empresario decided to study culinary arts in Barranquilla, a skill that had been his passion since his youth.\r\n\r\nTo exercise his new profession, Jose elaborated meals for his friends' fiestas and social events.  Subsequently, he opened his own restaurant and the public acceptance has been great, because his location is attractive, the food exquisite, and the prices affordable.  The specialties of the house are the typical dishes of his native Guajira, such as shrimp and rice, seafood in coconut sauce, and leg of pork.\r\n\r\nThis is his 1st loan with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, and he will invest it in provisions at wholesale, and a new refrigerator to replace the small icebox he has at present.  Monthly, the restaurant sells approximately 1,500 meals at an average price of 4,500 COP, which results in monthly sales of 6,480,000 COP.  The average profit margin is 46.7%, demonstrating the good profitability of the business.\r\n\r\nJose plans to expand his sales, delivering his meals to homes and medium enterprises, and he is currently making the necessary contacts.  In the short term, during this end-of-the-year season, orders for special meals have increased considerably.  This micro-entrepreneur can be defined as a happy man dedicated to satisfying the tastes of his customers with the best recipes of Colombian gastronomy. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":655105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"TO BUY PROVISIONS AT WHOLESALE AND A NEW REFRIGERATOR, TO REPLACE THE SMALL ICEBOX HE CURRENTLY USES","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-30T16:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":132721},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140057},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":142741},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145477},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":148265},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":151107},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":154003},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":156955},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":159963},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":168711}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.71},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.78,"local_amount":132721,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135340.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427723,"comment":null},{"amount":74.7,"local_amount":140057,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":142820.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001145,"comment":null},{"amount":76.13,"local_amount":142741,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":145557.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289155,"comment":null},{"amount":58.44,"local_amount":109574,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":111736.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157298,"comment":null},{"amount":78.3,"local_amount":146806,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":149702.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230309,"comment":null},{"amount":62.46,"local_amount":117117,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":119428.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673401,"comment":null},{"amount":55.94,"local_amount":104886,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":106955.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614205,"comment":null},{"amount":51.26,"local_amount":96106,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T08:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":98002.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568969,"comment":null},{"amount":271.99,"local_amount":509992,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":520055.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188845,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-07T21:34:40Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253923,"name":"Baloon Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Telesia D. is in her mid-thirties and is married with four children.

The group has 7 female members who are determined to get ahead in life.  The group was founded four months ago and the women have shown that they have the necessary drive to succeed.\r\n\r\nOne of the group's members is 33 year-old Mar\u00eda Santill\u00e1n.  She is a single mother and has three children who are the driving force in her life.  Every morning she takes care of her housework and in the afternoon she sells 'anticuchos' (a type of kebab - a traditional food in this country).  This is how she makes money and it is the only source of financial support for her household.\r\n\r\nThrough her hard work selling 'anticuchos', Mar\u00eda has been able to get ahead in life and give her children an education (they are in high school).  She has also been able to buy a plot of land on which she plans to build a house in the future.  She plans to invest her loan in improving the building from which she sells her 'anticuchos'.  Just like Mar\u00eda Santill\u00e1n, each member of the 'Dios nos Ama' community bank has their own story to tell but what they have in common is their enthusiasm and their desire to get ahead for the good of themselves and their families.

She is a homemaker and a businesswoman and she will invest her loan in galvanized metal for making novelty items.\r\n\r\nShe started her home with a pair of modest rooms made only from brick and pegboard.  She used to have a small grocery store (for almost six years) and this is how she got into business.  She also sold sweets and soft drinks.  In order to establish her business, she had to reduce her home to only one room.  Later, she decided to close the store because of space reasons in her house.  Thanks to her savings and the loans she received, she undertook her current business of selling novelty items, which she is able to do in her free time.  She intends to use this loan to grow her business and, in the future, to expand her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":655301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy galvanized metal for making novelty items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Atlacomulco, Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Natalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remedios","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crisanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1848},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1895},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1944},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1994},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2045},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2097},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2151},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2207},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2263},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2321},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2381},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2442},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2505},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2569},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2635},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2703}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.65},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.93},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.27},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.79},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.3},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.8},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.72},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.27},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":783.48,"local_amount":9726,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9785.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660135,"comment":null},{"amount":702.29,"local_amount":8718,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8770.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403404,"comment":null},{"amount":777.28,"local_amount":9649,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":9707.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195982046,"comment":null},{"amount":636.95,"local_amount":7907,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7954.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264094,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T12:39:47Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:44:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253981,"name":"Monserrate Encarnacion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Monserrate de 45 a\u00f1os, vende ropa y peluches recorriendo las calles del Guasmo.

She established her business selling handicrafts from San Jacinto, in Bolivar department.  Here they make handicrafts such as hammocks, bags and knitted items with special painting techniques which are only made with such commitment and good taste in this particular town.\r\n\r\nMilena started out with only a little bit of capital and a very small quantity of handicrafts but she found a big consumer market in Soledad which is where she lives with her two children aged 7 and 4 and where her business grew both in terms of number of customers and in infrastructure because she now displays the handicrafts in display cases in the living room of her home.  Her main goal is to have independent premises where she can display and sell her products.  She would like to have a specialized retail outlet for arts from Los Montes de Maria.\r\n\r\nMilena is applying for her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and it is a Kiva loan which she will use to buy beautiful musical mobiles adorned with flowers, hammocks, traditional sandals and coffee tables.  Her average sales are 2,743,857 Colombian pesos.  Her debt (with the loan) would be 35.4% and she maintains a profitability of 31%.  Her accounts receivable turnover is every 18 days and her inventory turnover is every 23 days.  She will use her loan to increase her working capital and, consequently, her profits because the sales seasons for these products which are very much in demand with families in Soledad are approaching."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":655369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy

During high tourist seasons they go all the time as well as at the end of the year and at the middle of the year.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the large number of tourists, both from all of Colombia and foreigners alike, that enjoy their rest, she also offers other products like delicious cakes, sweet hayacas (a type of tamale) and water thereby earning additional income, especially during the  high season that\u2019s about to start in this tourist destination.\r\n\r\nNelsis wants to buy 40 beach chairs and this is precisely why she\u2019s applying for a Kiva loan, her second loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, because she wants to increase profits with a larger number of beach chairs to relax in during this good season.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to buy a vehicle to use in the business because that would help transport and would pay for itself.  This is why she works so hard so that in the not too distant future she will meet this great challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":655390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To buy 40 beach chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-30T23:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelsis Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":37984},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":38617},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":39260},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":39915},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40580},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41256},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41944},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42643},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43354},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":44076},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":44811},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.59},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.45},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.89,"local_amount":37984,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":39943.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688491,"comment":null},{"amount":21.24,"local_amount":38617,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40609.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001149,"comment":null},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":79175,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83260.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289160,"comment":null},{"amount":22.32,"local_amount":40580,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42673.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157302,"comment":null},{"amount":22.69,"local_amount":41256,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":43384.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230314,"comment":null},{"amount":23.07,"local_amount":41944,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":44108.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673406,"comment":null},{"amount":23.45,"local_amount":42643,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":44843.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319966,"comment":null},{"amount":23.84,"local_amount":43354,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":45591.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803114,"comment":null},{"amount":24.25,"local_amount":44076,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":46350.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614210,"comment":null},{"amount":24.64,"local_amount":44811,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":47123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568199,"comment":null},{"amount":25.06,"local_amount":45560,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":47910.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779555,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T05:48:37Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":254012,"name":"Maria Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 55 a\u00f1os, tiene una tienda de v\u00edveres en la parte delantera de su casa.

The official name of this borrowing group is Millions.\r\n\r\nNilda is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Nilda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a clothing business.

Nilda has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nilda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nilda is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Nilda from GDMPC.
