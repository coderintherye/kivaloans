Since she was a child, she had to work with her mother in the markets, selling vegetables, fruit, and clothes. When she got married, she didn't stop working because she had to support her husband in walking sales. Thanks to the effort of the two of them, they were able to save and bought a piece of land for their home in the Isla Trinitaria neighborhood. The business is located in their home, and they work there every day of the week from 5:00 am to 9:00 pm. In the bakery they also sell other products to go with bread such as: milk, cheese, butter, juice. Rosa also saw the opportunity to sell fast foods, so she goes out every afternoon with her cart and her stove to the corner and brings in more income for her household. Rosa wants this loan because she needs to increase her inventory to make bread. She needs certain utensils, and also wishes to renovate her display case for bread, which will certainly help them increase their income. \r\n\r\n<p> Rosa is 59 years old. She has one child who has already finished university. Her husband is her right hand in the business, and he has always supported her in everything. They are a family who come from the mountains, they are very humble, they were never able to go to school which is why they don't know how to read or write but they manage the accounts very well. Their charisma has helped them in dealing with people. Currently they have their house, which at first was made of cane, and bit by bit has been changed to cement. Their greatest satisfaction is to have given their daughter her education. Now she is a professional, who also helps with the business.\r\n\r\n<p>(Translated from the Spanish by Naomi Johnson, Kiva volunteer)\r\n\r\n<p>Rosa  actualmente se dedica con su esposo hacer pan, pasteles y bocaditos, desde ni\u00f1a tuvo que trabajar con su madre en los mercados vendiendo legumbres, frutas, ropa; cuando se caso no dej\u00f3 de trabajar porque tuvo que apoyar a su esposo en las ventas ambulantes, gracias al esfuerzo de ambos pudieron ahorrar y se compraron un terreno para su casa en la zona de la Isla Trinitaria.

He received his pharmacy certificate after finishing secondary school in 1993, and, for 13 years now, has been working in the same area (pictured).  As a result of the long years of his work, the community knows Patrick personally. The next closest dispensary in the area is far away; therefore, people prefer to go to him for advice and drugs.  Patrick has also been trained as a community health worker, and has been providing home-based care for people living with HIV\/AIDS for the past three years. He sells drugs at lower prices than his competitors, and often gives free drugs to his clients or those in need. His best-selling products are painkillers, anti-malaria and family planning drugs, allergy medications, ulcer, worms and skin infection treatment, and various syrups for children suffering from malaria and upper respiratory infections.

owns a small store where he sells basic school and office supplies.

His business has gone well despite his difficulty in accessing capital. He has slowly been introducing new products to his store and has found success.

She does not have a husband because he left her and the kids when they were still very young. She has had to take care of the family; with her income she was able to buy a property and build a house made of cane, which she later improved using cement. At the same time, she has another source of income from a property she is renting out.

Lucy was born in 1965 in Tinganga, Kiambu. She is married with five children. Two are out of school and in college while the other three are still in primary and secondary school. Lucy is an active member of Kaspat Catholic Church. Her colleagues formed a group in 2002 and registered with WEEC the same year. \r\nShe has been the group discipline mistress since its formation. Lucy has been a farmer since her youth. She is a role model to many young women. \r\nWhen she was young, she used to look after her father\u0092s cow after school. Today Lucy keeps dairy cattle. She is also a poultry farmer.

is married. She has a grown son who is 26 and is fostering a 10-year-old orphan boy from a disfunctional family of alcoholics. She also takes care of an elderly lady who doesn\u2019t have a family. Irina\u2019s business selling office supplies and providing copying services is the main source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nIrina is very sociable. Her friendliness and respectful attitude have given her a good reputation at the market. Irina has also proven to be a good manager of her finances. She has received and promptly repaid 12 loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Loans have enabled a gradual expansion of Irina\u2019s business. Originally she had only one portable table with office supplies. Lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped her purchase inventory in bulk and rent a storage room. Recently she bought two copier machines and now provides copying services.\r\n\r\nIrina is requesting a loan of $1,200 for several purposes. She is planning to purchase a range of office supplies, toner and copier paper. Financial assistance will help Irina secure good maintenance for her copy machines so that she can provide a high quality copying service. It will also help her cover some necessities at home to improve the quality of life for her family. Increased sales and services will generate more profits allowing Irina to save money and eventually buy a facility for her business which has always been her dream.

is divorced with three kids. Her husband was an alcoholic and left the family 7 years ago. As the one left with the responsibility of raising her children, Olga was forced to find ways to provide for her family. The owner of the grocery store where she worked was moving to a different city and decided to sell the store. Olga took a risk and used her savings to purchase the store which is located on one of the main highways in town. \r\n\r\nLending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped promote the growth of Olga\u2019s business. She was able to remodel the interior of the store and hire three people to help her run it. Olga received her first loan in 2005 and since then has never had a single late payment \u2013 even when it\u2019s been freezing cold and her sales were down. The loans have enabled Olga to increase her business income allowing her to buy a comfortable, private home for her family.\r\n\r\nOlga is requesting a loan of $1,200 to expand the selection of groceries in her store.

is married with one daughter, Natasha, who is a college student. Zhanna\u2019s store which sells men\u2019s sweaters in the winter and T-shirts in the summer is located at one of the busiest city markets. She\u2019s been in this business for 9 years. \r\n\r\nZhanna is a serious and prudent business owner. Her perseverance together with lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d has enabled her to gradually expand her business. Today Zhanna owns a store and three containers. Containers are large metal shipping containers often used for overseas shipping. They can be used for storage, but make an ideal shelter for market vendors sell merchandise from. In Nikolaev most market entrepreneurs own little stores or such containers. Zhanna\u2019s working capital has grown from $6,000 to $15,000 since she received her first loan from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. There are many vendors and competition in clothing sales is high, however, Zhanna\u2019s pleasant manner and willingness to meet client\u2019s needs have helped her keep loyal clientele. The fact that she accepts plastic credit or debit cards, which are gaining popularity in Ukraine, attracts even more potential clients to her business. \r\n\r\nZhanna is requesting a loan of $1,200 to purchase an assortment of clothing items in bulk to sell in one of her container-stores. She is planning to buy warm sweaters, pullovers and jerseys that are in high demand in the cold winter season. Eventually, Zhanna plans to invest her profit into the construction of her own store building somewhere in busy, downtown Nikolaev. Her responsibility, stable business growth, and prompt payment record characterize Zhanna as a consistent and serious entrepreneur capable of loan repayment. \r\n\r\n<p>

to a fisherman, Mrs. Ahoefa H. is the mother of four (4) children and is also responsible for her own two (2) younger brothers and one of her husband's brothers. Her business is producing palm oil. This is a very profitable buisiness that allows Mrs. H. to contribute to the household expenses. Because of the high quality of oil she produces, she has so many customers that she can no longer supply them all. It takes a large amount of money to acquire palm nuts for preparing the oil. Since she does not have this money, Mrs. H. cannot put enough palm oil on the market. In order to fill this gap and improve her family's income at the same time, she is asking for a credit of $850 to purchase a supply of palm nuts and improve her production facilities. This will help her better meet the needs of her family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMari\u00e9e \u00e0 un p\u00eacheur, Madame H.

In order to be able to meet the expenses of her family, Mrs. T. produces doughnuts every day and then sells them along the side of the roads in her village. She is an assertive woman, very involved in community life, and was able to pay back her initial credit of $350 promptly and without any difficulties. She is hoping to receive a new credit of $650 to improve her business by buying a supply of wheat flour, sugar, oil, and firewood to produce her doughnuts. This credit will undoubtedly change the course of her entire family's life.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame T.

In the textile trade, one must stock the latest patterns and designs. Otherwise, a retailer can easily lose clientele. The means that Mrs. D. has today don\u2019t allow her to keep up with these trends to satisfy her demanding customers. To overcome this shortfall, she is seeking an $850 loan to enlarge her fabric display to meet market demand. This project\u2019s financing will allow her to increase her income, which will have a positive impact on her family\u2019s standard of living. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame D.

Ay\u00e9l\u00e9 F. is a young mother of three (3) children. She is married to a bicycle mechanic. Early on, Mrs F. understood that the revenue of her husband wouldn't cover the expenses of the household. In order to do this, she started a business and opened a small restaurant. The quality of her service and the cleanliness of her restaurant mean a parade of many clients throughout the day. Mrs F. has demonstrated honesty and has proven herself a trustworthy woman, paying back her first two loans without incident. Today, she is hoping to newly impress her clientele by introducing new meals into her menu.  To do this, she needs more consistant financial support. The loan of $700 that she is asking for will be used to fix up her restaurant. It will also be used as permanent business capital to acquire the raw materials for the preparation of her meals. This will definitely increase the revenue of Mrs Ay\u00e9l\u00e9 F. to the benefit of her family. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Fench by Susan Bell, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n Madame F.

The realisation of this project will increase her revenues and improve the living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from FRENCH by Susan Bell, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame L.

She is very courageous and ambitious and would like to become a wholesale seller and go to onion-producing villages herself to buy her supplies. This would require additional funds, but Ms. A. does not currently possess the capital needed. She is thus requesting a loan of $700 to build her supply in these times of high production in order to increase her profit during times of need. The loan requested will allow her to buy onions wholesale, stock them and sell them during periods of high demand. This will be very profitable both financially and morally but will most of all allow her to provide better living conditions for her family.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nMadame A.

His wife does not work and does not contribute to the household income, which makes life difficult for Mr. D.. He has been noted for his ability to repay loans before the deadline and especially for his energy and over thirty years of experience in making sodabi.

Essenam S. is a married mother of four children.

Her husband is a moped and motorcycle mechanic who is unable to pay the household expenses due to a lack of customers.

She is requesting a new loan of $800 to increase the size of her shop and display window. The amount requested will serve to buy and sell new lines of secondhand clothing. In light of the existing needs of her family, this loan will be very beneficial as it will allow her to increase her income, something that will have a large effect on her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nMadame S.

She tried the pancakes but it didn\u2019t work, so she saved the rest of the loan. She said that one day while she was in the shop, a car stopped by her shop and asked if there\u2019s any nearby Laundromat in the area. That is when she got the idea of extending the building for the Laundromat. So she hurriedly paid up her loan, and ready for the next loan.\r\n\r\nOn Leutu\u2019s 3rd loan that she saved, plus this 4th loan, she was able to buy 2 washing machines.

Her husband works long days at the village Mayor\u2019s Office and has no time to take care of the animals. Larisa lives on the edge of town and the closest well is downhill from her property, which makes it extremely difficult to bring water for her family and her livestock. Behind her house are her animals and their pens - pigs and piglets, 2 cows for milk production, countless chickens and 2 sheep. All these animals require a tremendous amount of water per day and bringing that water up the hill occupies a good portion of Larisa\u2019s day.

is divorced with a teenage son. After her husband left the family, Ludmila was forced to find ways to provide for her family.

At her kiosk patrons always feel welcome as she gives each one her full attention and serves them politely and with respect. Her reasonable pricing and variety of inventory appeal to many modest clients. Ludmila has promptly repaid all 8 loans she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. She understands the value of lending services that have helped her business grow and become self-sustainable.   \r\n\r\nLudmila is requesting a loan of $1,000 to increase her retail inventory. She is planning to purchase a variety of weatherproof, insulated jackets, parkas, and vests as well as jean outfits that will be both durable and practical for a variety of customers.

L. runs a small market business selling cosmetics and household chemical products. She is married with two children. After attending college she worked as a design engineer, but was unable to earn a stable salary. Seeking another source of income, Klavdiya decided to start her own small business. When Klavdiya first rented a kiosk at the central city market there were very few other entrepreneurs selling these types of products. She recognized an opportunity and decided to fill the market niche. \r\n\r\nKlavdiya is very client-friendly and sociable. She\u2019s been in this business for 12 years and can easily guess the preferences of her customers which helps build customer loyalty. Many times Klavdiya has been able to fill special orders for her customers. Her business has done well through the years. Presently, Klavdiya has around $1,500 of working capital.  Her integrity and responsibility have helped her keep her business stable allowing her pay back all of the loans she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d.     \r\n\r\nKlavdiya is requesting a loan of $1,000 to increase her inventory and purchase modern brands of cosmetics. She is planning to purchase moisturizers, hair sprays, toners, body lotions, shower gels and a variety of other premium cosmetics to appeal to the tastes of new clients. A good array of beauty-oriented products will help Klavdiya better serve the needs of her clients, making their body and hair care experience more enjoyable and pleasant. Expanding her selection of beauty products will promote further growth in Klavdiya\u2019s business and will help her support her children and family which she believes is her first priority as a mother. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0456\u044f \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f \u0431\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443 \u0437

Christina believes in independence and wanted to set up a business to provide a good future for her husband and her self. With no children she wanted to start saving and building a good stable home before children arrive into the picture. So she joined the programme in 2003. Her first loan was used to start a small grocery store, which was operated from at home. The only grocery shop in her neighborhood Christina was able to use the following loans to build a permanent place for the shop in front of their home. Being the sole breadwinner of the family, she carefully budgets her earnings to sustain her family needs and set aside some cash for savings and loan payment. It is quite difficult for her to support an extended family but expanding her grocery will help ease her burden. Christina hopes to use her loan to improve her small grocery store and purchase more stocks.

Salim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Jose Salim M.  is a farmer from a rural town named Salitre. He is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but it is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salim, as he is most commonly known, owns a ranch named <em>Hacienda Voluntad de Dios<\/em>. He has more than 20 years of experience in agriculture and ranching. His staple crop is rice, but he also has several cows and bulls. He and his wife have 3 kids who all help their father with the duties on the ranch. Salim hopes to provide them with an education so that they may expand their horizons.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":15458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"He is a farmer who will use the loan to cultivate rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-02-19T01:31:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Salim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-08T02:36:51Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T15:02:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13841,"comment":"Primer pago"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:43:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19612,"comment":"2do pago de asociacion resistencia de salitre"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:59:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26603,"comment":"3er pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:01:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36150,"comment":"4to pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:24:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47468,"comment":"5to pago resistencia"},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59568,"comment":"6to pago asoc resistencia"}],"funded_date":"2007-02-22T02:36:51Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":4586,"name":"Wilman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Wilman S. is a rice farmer from a rural town named Salitre.

His father taught him how to grow rice and he has been working in the fields his whole life. He is very proud to be from Salitre, a small rural town in Ecuador known for its heavy rice production. He is seeking the loan in order to improve the infrastructure on his farm. He has 5 children for whom he works very hard to educate. His personal goals are to provide his children with a much better education than the one he received. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edgar is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad.

The current loan of US$1200 will enable him to prepare his shamba (small farm) for the planting season. The loan will be repaid from the sale of his existing stock of maize. Rather than sell his maize at this time when there is excess on the market and prices are low, the loan will bridge the gap, enabling him to get the best price from his produce later. In view of the important role that agriculture plays in the lives of the local community, PEMCI is considering providing such loans, commonly known as inventory credit, again in the future. This will enable the farmers to regain control of their finances and sell their produce when the market is at its best.

Through her business she has gained a wide range of knowledge and skill, allowing her to teach other local women how to run and manage a business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":15545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Buy beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Malaba - Teso District","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":27,"posted_date":"2007-02-19T01:37:56Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-05T18:00:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-05-05T09:25:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-05T09:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15212,"comment":"scheduled repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-06-05T09:16:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-05T09:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T09:16:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-05T09:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29204,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-08-05T09:17:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-05T09:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39156,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-09-05T09:16:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-05T09:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50706,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-02-19T18:00:17Z","paid_date":"2007-09-05T09:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":4602,"name":"Yelena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yelena is married with a grown daughter. She started her business selling leather gloves, wallets and purses 6 years ago. Low competition and high market demand have enabled rapid growth in the business. Currently Yelena has 4 container-stores at one the busiest city markets. \r\n\r\nYelena is a very hard-worker. She has a saying, \u201cYou are a bad market vendor if you don\u2019t get income by the end of a working day.\u201d Yelena has proven to be very prudent client of \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d \u2013 she never asks for a bigger loan than she can pay back. Lending services in combination with her perseverance, trustworthiness and responsibility have helped to guarantee success in her business.\r\n\r\nYelena is requesting a loan of $1,200 to increase her inventory. She would like to purchase assorted leather gloves at wholesale prices to re-sell in her container-stores. She is able to reduce her transportation expenses by purchasing more inventory in bulk when she travels to remote wholesale centers. Yelena\u2019s long term goal is the continued expansion of her business. She would like to purchase another container-store in the Nikolaev area and eventually open a whole network of leather goods stores in Nikolaev and further away in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.

Arweya is a 45-year old father of five children (4 sons and a daughter). He lives with his family in one of the slums of Kisumu, Kenya.  He initiated his tayloring business in 1989 with the help of a sewing machine that he rented for US$ 2.86 a month. Through hard work, he managed to purchase his own machine in 1990. He specializes in making women's dresses and school uniforms. The central location of his shop, in addition to eight years of successfully doing business within the community, has gained him a good reputation and a wide customer base.
