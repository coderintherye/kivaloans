Being a saleswoman is a trade that Lesbia learned when she was very young as she used to sell clothes, shoes and cosmetics as an itinerant vendor.  At the age of 35, she decided to set up her grocery store and she has been in this business for ten years now.

He has been in the farming business for 20 years, selling all his produce at the local market. Farming has been his main source of income. His major challenge has been lack of a ready market for farm produce, which affects his cash flows. \n\nCharles has requested a loan of 70,000 Kenyan shillings in order to cultivate his banana farm. He specifically wants to expand the acreage under bananas by acquiring more land. He says that this will improve his banana production and enable him to enjoy the economies of scale.

The couple are together in coping with household expenses. Gilberte is a merchant and has been in this business for five years and has a certain amount of fame. She mainly sells various items of dress, such as bead necklaces, footwear, ready-to-wear, decorative objects, and more. She makes her purchases according to her actual turnover rate and the needs of her local customer base at Tokpa, the largest market in Benin, and in Togo, a country bordering Benin. \r\n\r\nOur client makes the beads herself. To do so, she buys the raw materials and makes use of a few tools that help her make them. She has a variety of customers made up of people who live in her commercial district and nearby. \r\n\r\nThe burgeoning requests from her customers compels her to turn toward the micro-financing that FINADEV grants her in order to develop her business and to maximize her profits. With this loan, Gilberte will be able to cope with the financial needs of her family. She would like her business to progress, so as to allow her to send her children abroad for school.

She also receives a grant from the South African government to support her children.\r\n\r\nLungile requested a loan from WDB and Kiva to add to her stock of airtime and cold drinks. Eventually, she would like to use the earnings from her business to purchase a car, which will greatly help her business expand even further.

Since her youth and adulthood, farming has been part of her life, allowing her to support her family for several years. The constant training she has received during these 15 years has been applied in her fields in an increasingly technical way and in this way she has been able to increase her capital.   \r\n\r\nShe also works raising and selling cattle, an activity that she has been doing for 7 years.  This activity provides more income to support herself while she is waiting for the months of growth for her crops, which are mainly corn, potato, onion, carrot and spinach.  \r\n\r\nCurrently the price of the sacks of manure and quality seeds have increased, making it necessary to increase her working capital beyond what she has currently available.  She has decided to grow hand in hand with MFP, because she felt it was an interesting proposition for progressing her business. Since then she has had 11 opportunities to apply for loans, which have always served to increase her working capital.

He began his business because his late father used to deal in fish trading, so when he grew up he joined him in the business until he became perfect at selling fish. He is making good profits. Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, he earns about 1,100,000 leones (SLL) every month from his business. Amadu serves retailing business women from the villages and in town. Amadu trades on the west coast where he gets a larger quantity of fish. He travels by vehicle at least twice per month for his business. Rise in transport costs affect him greatly and, though competition is high, he interacts well with his customers so usually he gains more customers. \r\n\r\nAmadu would like a loan in the amount of 4,500,000 SLL. He has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy one basket of herring fish for 2,000,000 SLL and two baskets of assorted fish for 1,200,000 SLL. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 300,000 SLL. In the future, Amadu plans to improve on his business and also see that his children go through university. He plans to save some of his profits for his children's education and to add some on to his capital. He is hardworking and honest.

When she became an adolescent she moved to the city of Huancayo seeking better opportunities.  However, she opted to sell cattle at the commercial markets, the activity that most pleases her.  This is how she buys animals at a lower price and after a rigorous period of time feeding them she resells them at the same market for a higher price.  With all these years of experience she knows which animals to buy and which ones to pass on and she is not fooled by animals that might be sick and affect her profits.

I do not yet have children, but I will soon be a mother.  I live in the city where I was born and where my primary business activity is selling food.\u201d  Ruth Mery has a small restaurant where she sells breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  At the moment the business is incapacitated because they are refurbishing the place.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the business for one year, and it is going very well for her thanks to the effort she puts into her work.  At this time Ruth Mery is working in a laundry washing clothes from seven in the morning until midday on Mondays through Fridays.\r\n\r\nHer father invited her to participate in the communal bank.  Her first loan was for 800 soles, and she used it to buy supplies.  This time she needs the loan to equip her restaurant, and she wants to buy chairs, tables, and utensils.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":821064,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2425,"youtube_id":"MmMSDdzufiI"},"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to equip her restaurant and buy chairs, tables, and utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Echarate - La Convencion - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-07-23T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ruth Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antoquia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jhonn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Honorata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neftali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8500,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1284.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1334.97},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1387.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1442.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1500.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1549.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":472.07},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.8},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":551.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":569.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":472.07,"local_amount":1284.04,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226988985,"comment":null},{"amount":490.8,"local_amount":1334.97,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1341.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232747689,"comment":null},{"amount":510.26,"local_amount":1387.89,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238551764,"comment":null},{"amount":530.5,"local_amount":1442.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1450.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244510586,"comment":null},{"amount":1121.37,"local_amount":3050.14,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3065.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250718161,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-14T12:23:50Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:25:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":320534,"name":"Ketty","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ketty vive en su tierra natal en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo  y sus 2 hijos en su propia casa.
