However, her store is poorly equipped and she is unable to satisfy in a timely manner her customers, who appreciate her styles and fashions, which they find impeccable. She runs her store modestly and has demonstrated her assured honesty through her first two loans of $350 and $550, obtained and repaid without incident, despite bearing all the familial responsibilities, since her husband has been unemployed for two years. She deserves to be supported financially in the growth and development of her store.

in 1963 in Lom\u00e9, Yawovi A. is a trained launderer. He is a married father of two children. Not having had the opportunity to go to school, he began learning the laundry business in Ghana at a young age. When he returned to Togo 20 years ago, he worked as a launderer for several dry cleaning companies for very low wages. Realizing that he was being severely exploited by his employers, he decided to work for himself but is facing extreme financial and material need in starting the business. He has a good reputation in his neighborhood and even in far-away areas, thanks to the quality of his work and his customer service. He has thus succeeded in earning the trust of his customers, who are growing in number along with an ever-growing number of orders. He is very clever and has the mindset of a good business manager. He also realizes that subcontracting is not very beneficial to him, as he only earns 40% of the profits. After researching the area, he has found a good location for his business and is seeking financing to move in.<p>\r\n\r\nTo do so, Yawovi A. is requesting a loan of $1500 to rent a shop and buy a washing machine and irons. The successful completion of this project will allow him to stabilize his income and improve his family\\'s living conditions. Even though he does not yet have his shop, he already employs three apprentices. Such a project deserves to be quickly funded in order to encourage young people to take up this promising profession.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1963 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9, A. Yawovi est blanchisseur de formation. Il est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de deux (02) enfants. N\u2019ayant pas eu la chance de faire des \u00e9tudes, il s\u2019est lanc\u00e9 tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t dans l\u2019apprentissage de la blanchisserie au Ghana. Revenu au Togo, il y a 20 ans de cela, il a exerc\u00e9 ce m\u00e9tier dans plusieurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de pressing avec des salaires d\u00e9risoires. S\u2019apercevant qu\u2019il se fait s\u00e9rieusement exploit\u00e9 par ses employeurs, il d\u00e9cida de s\u2019installer en son propre compte, mais il fait face \u00e0 un besoin financier et mat\u00e9riel s\u00e9rieux pour s\u2019\u00e9quiper. La qualit\u00e9 de ses prestations et son bon accueil font sa r\u00e9putation dans son quartier et m\u00eame des quartiers lointains. Ainsi, il su gagner davantage la confiance de sa client\u00e8le qui devient de plus en plus important et les commandes sans cesse croissantes. Tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieux et ayant l\u2019esprit d\u2019un bon gestionnaire, il se rend compte \u00e9galement que la sous traitance ne lui est pas tr\u00e8s avantageux car il ne gagne que 40% de sa marge b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.

Most people in rural areas rely to a large extent on production of some agricultural good as a source of income. Gheorghe B. is a farmer in pork meats who lives in the tiny village of Cabaiesti, which practically has no infrastructure whatsoever and is hard to even reach with public transportation. What has been missing in many agricultural sectors has been sufficient value-added processing, especially among small producers, like Gherorghe who often lack the resources to take those additional steps. Harvests are usually sold in bulk and without much differentiation or additional input. More recently, however, even small farmers began noticing the profitability of further processing, experimenting with various forms of conservation and enhancement. Gheorghe began a small-scale operation drying of plums to try to supplement the income generated by his pork raising activity, which has fallen dramatically due to lower pork prices. Gheorghe still has 8 pigs and many piglets which he will continue to raise as he begins his new venture. He has one half hectare of orchard himself and wants to buy more plums from others to dry and subsequently sell in bulk to wholesalers in the city. Gheorghe has a positive outlook and hopes that this new venture will add to his earnings from his pork business. To realize these plans, he needs a loan to purchase 1 ton of plums for drying and 5 tons of concentrated feed to nourish his pigs during the winter months.

Mihail\u2019s family has always had a small farm, but he has not been involved in more commercial production. He would like to start now, having seen others in the area become successful entrepreneurs in raising animals. His brother owns a large barn formerly used in a collective farm, which, is already outfitted with most of the necessary equipment he needs and is an ideal location for Mihail\u2019s planned business. The operation would encompass 30 sheep, which would be used for milk production, cheese making called Brinza, as well as for wool, and 10 calves, which would be raised in part for reproduction and in part for meat. Mihail already has land on which he grows wheat and hay, which will serve as good feed for all the animals. He has thought through the market prices for the various products he will have and is aware of the risk involved should they change, but believes he will be able to make a decent profit.

Gheorghe O. lives in the town of Sipoteni, rather than joining the many farmers already involved in production, he decided to take a further step and begin processing the produce into a higher value good. The main focus and cash crop of his business is drying plums into prunes, but his equipment can be used for many different kinds of fruits and vegetables. Gheorghe also produces dried apples, eggplant, squash and tomatoes to name a few.  For this he uses a high efficiency drying machine, powered by a gas furnace and multiple fans. It takes only one and a half hours for a batch of fresh produce to dry completely. After dehydration, the goods can be stored, packaged and shipped much more efficiently and obviously brings higher prices. His products are sold around Moldova and are bought by wholesalers as well. \r\nThe scale of the operation has really grown lately, now having reached a level of production of 300 kilograms of fruit or vegetables per shift. The process of cleaning, de-seeding, and drying requires about a dozen workers per shift for this volume (these workers are all women from a local village), so his company currently employs 25 people. Gheorghe now needs a short term loan to fund the purchase of the last harvest of plums to fill a large order.

is divorced. She has two grown up children: a son and a daughter. She is a Technical school graduate. She studied industrial manufacturing in college. After school Tamara worked at the factory as a production engineer. The money she earned wasn\u2019t enough to feed her family. That is why Tamara decided to start her own business and become self-sustainable. \r\n\r\nTamara sells a range of clothing for women, paintings and souvenirs at one of the local outdoor markets. She is very open-hearted, sociable and polite. She has been a salesperson for several years and is very good at her business. Tamara has been a client of \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d since 2005. She received and repaid 6 loans without any delinquencies. She has perfect credit history in \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d and good reputation among other market vendors.  \r\n\r\nTamara wanted to get a loan of $600 which she will invest in increasing her inventory and purchasing new clothing items in bulk. She wants to buy warm sweaters, pullovers, jerseys and jackets for the cold winter season in Ukraine. This will help her meet the needs and demands of her customers. Tamara would also like to purchase watches, perfumes and a variety of souvenirs which always sell well before this holiday season. The loan will give Tamara a chance to expand her trade and increase sales. Tamara will be able to use the profits to invest in her family\u2019s welfare and further growth of her business.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0422\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0430

She got married at age 18 to her only husband, with whom she had three children. They are currently separated and she says that she's been divorced for 15 years. After the separation from her husband, she worked with two companies, one a chicken breeder. During the 16 years of war between Frelimo and Renamo, she took refuge in the Kingdom of Swaziland, where she worked at a wood processing company as a peeler until 2003, and then the company went bankrupt and she was given severance pay. With that, she returned to Mozambique, having built a commercial establishment, and then she didn't have enough funds to acquire stock and through her sister found out about HLUVUKU.\r\n<p>\r\nThe first loan was for the purchase of basic goods, so she was able to grow up to now.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she plans to acquire a means of transportation to make purchases for her establishment, while also being able to transport goods for other merchants in her area, since Macassane is 50 km away from the city of Maputo.

Nancy is 45 years old. She is married and has 5 children. Nancy had benefited from Kiva by receiving a loan of USD 300 that enabled her to buy a dairy cow to improve her family income level. Nancy has also been voted in as the new treasurer of Queen Esther women group. The group elected its new official as per the group constitution. Nancy is one of the strong members in the group. Before the closure of the year, the group approved a loan of USD 300 for Nancy to enable her pay her son\u2019s secondary school fees. The son is sitting for the final secondary school exam in 2007 and repayment of the school fees will enable him to concentrate in his studies without interruptions.

She then learned to sew, and for five years she has been running her own dressmaking shop, called \u00abVivre Ensemble\u00bb, or Live Together, thanks to an initial loan of $350, which she repaid without a problem.  She is in a common-law marriage with a plumber who left in search of work in B\u00e9nin.  That is why Mrs. G. has been alone for 16 months with her 3-year-old daughter.  There has been no news of her husband.  She courageously deals with household expenses by herself.  An adroit and very energetic woman, she puts everything she knows into her work, and she is renowned in her neighborhood for the quality of her services.  She would like to include among her goods for sale various fabrics and other boutique items not currently available in her area.  This will provide a comprehensive range of goods for her customer base.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, she is requesting a loan of $950 to stock and sell traditional skirts, bags, and shoes for women.

Ms. A.\u2019s income has dwindled to next to nothing, and she is no longer able to meet the needs of her family. She fears that, because of a lack of financial means, her children will stop going to school and will become delinquents.<p>\r\n\r\nTo strengthen and develop her business, Ms. Essi A. is requesting a loan of $950. The loan she is requesting will allow her to order charcoal wholesale from production areas, to transport it, to stock it and to resell it. This will allow Ms. A. to increase her income, to better her family\u2019s living conditions and above all to ensure her children\u2019s education, which is her greatest concern. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nAg\u00e9e de 40 ans, Mme A.

She is married and has three children. Not having had the chance to continue her secondary education, she engaged in trading small household items. Unfortunately, her husband, a taxi driver, no longer has a car, and his irregular income does not allow him to meet the needs of the household. Thus, more than 80% of the household expenses rest on his wife, who also needs to finance the growth of her business. As a result, misery has settled on this household where, paradoxically, there also reigns a good marital atmosphere. Very courageous and dynamic, she benefitted from a loan of $150 which allowed her to restart her business.

Although she is single and has no children, she is responsible for her mother and two cousins. With her pale skin and enviable beauty, she does not want to leave herself open to abuse by men. Her small savings and a $300 standby credit allowed her to buy a portable computer to do travelling secretarial work. This service would do more to increase her success and help her if she could receive more consistent financial support. This is why Ms. A. is currently asking for a $2000 credit to open a business center. The credit will be used to buy a microcomputer and a photocopier, and to install a telephone. Financing Ms. A. would act as encouragement and a good example for girls who succumb to debauchery, prostitution, and easy money, with all the problems that brings today like AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. A plan like hers deserves to be financed right away.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSecr\u00e9taire st\u00e9nographe de formation, Mlle A.

He had to drop out of his primary studies, and at the age of 15, he started his training as a tapestry-maker. At the end of his training, he could not get set up because he had no money to buy the necessary equipment, so he has to rent a sewing machine by the day, which he sets up on the side of the road to work. This is not at all profitable for him, because the cost for renting the machine is too high. Mr. A. therefore keeps sinking further into poverty with each passing day, despite his intelligence and creativity. He is currently asking for $950 in financial support, which would allow him to open and equip a workshop. The credit he is seeking would be enough to rent a workshop, and also to buy a sewing machine and other tapestry tools. With all of this, he would be able to have a stable income to meet the needs of his family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur A. Y. Nestor est n\u00e9 le 26 F\u00e9vrier 1979 \u00e0 Porto-Novo (B\u00e9nin). Il d\u00fbt arr\u00eater ses \u00e9tudes aux cours primaire et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 15 ans, il entra en formation de tapissier. A la fin de cette formation, il n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 s\u2019installer car n\u2019ayant aucun moyen pour s\u2019acheter le mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire, il est oblig\u00e9 de louer quotidiennement une machine \u00e0 coudre qu\u2019il installe au bord de la rue pour travailler. Ce qui ne lui est pas du tout rentable car les co\u00fbts de location de la machine sont trop \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Monsieur A. continue donc de sombrer dans la mis\u00e8re au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les jours passent malgr\u00e9 son intelligence et son esprit de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9. Il sollicite \u00e0 ce jour un appui financier de $950 qui lui permettra d\u2019ouvrir un atelier et de l\u2019\u00e9quiper. Le cr\u00e9dit qu\u2019il demande va servir \u00e0 louer un local pour son atelier, d\u2019acheter une machine \u00e0 coudre et autres outillages pour la tapisserie. Ce faisant, il pourra alors avoir des revenus stables pour subvenir aux besoins de sa famille."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":10921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy a sewing machine and small tools for tapestry work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Lom\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2007-01-07T20:27:50Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Y.

Paul T. was born on June 29 1975 in Lom\u00e9.  From a poor family, he had to abandon his studies once he reached secondary school in order to learn hydrolic mechanics.  He specialized in the repairs of shock absorbers and others, allowing him a fairly regular list of clients that he is sadly unable to satisfy due to a lack of performance materials.  This makes it very difficult to do his job since his clients are often not pleased with the time lag in their repairs.  In order to chance this situation, he would like to acquire other equipment in order to improve his performance and make his clients more loyal to him.  In order to accomplish this, Mr. T. is asking for a loan of $1200 which would allow him to buy, among other things, two table clamps and other tools.  This would enable him to improve his workshop, generate more profits and tend to the needs of his wife and two children.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur T. Paul est n\u00e9 le 29 juin 1975 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9. Issu d\u2019une famille pauvre, il a d\u00fb abandonner les \u00e9tudes au niveau secondaire pour apprendre la m\u00e9canique hydraulique. Il s\u2019est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9paration des amortisseurs et autres. Cette sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 lui a procur\u00e9 une client\u00e8le assez importante qu\u2019il n\u2019arrive pas malheureusement \u00e0 satisfaire convenablement par manque de mat\u00e9riels de travail performant. Ce qui rend tr\u00e8s difficile l\u2019exercice de son m\u00e9tier car les clients sont souvent m\u00e9contents du retard pris dans les prestations. Pour sortir de cette situation, il d\u00e9sire acqu\u00e9rir d\u2019autres \u00e9quipements en vue d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses prestations et fid\u00e9liser sa client\u00e8le. \r\nPour ce faire, Monsieur T. Paul sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $1200 qui va lui servir \u00e0 acheter entre autres, deux (02) \u00e9taux de table, une (01) cl\u00e9 \u00e0 griffe, une paire d\u2019arrache. Cela lui permettra de renforcer son atelier, d\u2019am\u00e9liorer son revenu et de pouvoir subvenir aux besoins de sa femme et de ses deux (02) enfants.

He began an apprenticeship and never stopped wowing people with his great work.  Very dynamic and an entrepreneur, he was able to open his own salon just after his apprenticeship ended, thanks to a loan of $150 that he obtained and regularly paid back.  The efficacity and quality of his work makes him an excellent hair stylist in his community.  Facing clients that are more and more demanding, Mr. M. now feels the need to update his equipment in order to be line with their requests.  IN order to do this, he is asking for a $1200 credir to improve his salon and his equipment.  This credit will alow him to buy electric razors, hair dryers, wash basins and cosmetic beauty products.  Financing this young man to improve his salon will be a great encouragement for others in the community to follow in his footsteps and take charge of their own destinies and not fall into juvenile deliquency.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur M.

He holds a high school diploma, but his parents had no money left to provide a university education for him.  He found employment in a shop, earning a little money to help support his three brother and his retired parents.  Household expenses continued to grow, so he used the little he had saved, plus a $350 loan, to open a hardware shop that he manages strictly and efficiently.  The location of his shop brings him a good number of customers, and he often runs out of certain items for sale.  He buys his merchandise locally, in Lom\u00e9, which does not leave him a profit margin in proportion to the size of his business.  Finding that more and more of his customers are disappointed, he has decided to stock goods from Nigeria.  Now, in order to do this, he needs more financial resources.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSo, to expand his business and augment the income he needs for his family that depends on him alone, Mr. A. is requesting a loan of $1,500 to enlarge his shop and to diversify the range of goods offered.

A., who is also called Yoyo, was born on March 25, 1977, in Badou (Wawa prefecture).  Coming from a family of seven children, she left school very early because her parents, short on funds, had preferred to send the boys to school to the detriment of the girls.  So she turned towards an apprenticeship in dressmaking.  Unfortunately, since completing her apprenticeship five years ago, she lacked the money to open up her own shop.  She worked outdoors at home using sewing machines she rents from friends and acquaintances.  But with the quality of her work, she received a lot of orders that are filled late just because of a lack of machines available.  Her customer base continued to grow and grow, so using the little money she saved, she decided to lease a shop of her own called \u00abYoyo Couture\u00bb.  But she still runs up against the problem of finances.  Her husband, a furniture maker without a steady income, finds himself unable to help her despite his willingness to do so.  A very level-headed and energetic young woman, Yolande needs financial support to make things work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nYolande is requesting a loan of $950 to renovate her shop and to buy two sewing machines.  Financing her means helping her improve the living condition of the four people she under her care, plus her parents weary with age.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMme A.

Coming from a family of nine children, she could not continue in school.  So, at a very early age, she started learning how to make and sell corn mush.  She was able to save a little money from this business and expanded into general grocery items sold from a display located in front of her house.  Business is booming, allowing her to help with household expenses, since she is married and the mother of four.  Today, Ms. A. would like to go professional by opening up a shop, but she lacks the funds to do so.  She is therefore requesting a loan of $1,000 to open a shop, that she will call \u00abChez Yawano\u00bb and to widen the range of goods for sale.  Her experience as a merchant to-date will guarantee the success of her plans.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nMadame A.

With his modest savings, he succeeded in opening a shop in Tabligbo.  Despite his impeccable work, he has trouble meeting customer expectations on time because he only has very basic equipment.  The situation has begun to discourage customers, so he could lose a good part of his customer base.  This has already had serious repercussions for his household, since his income is insufficient to cover all his bills.  To perfect and grow his business, Mr. A. has a pressing need to acquire new equipment, in order to better serve and regain the trust of his customers.  This requires financial means he currently does not have at his disposal.  So, he is requesting a loan of $850 as capital for modern tools to equip his shop, thereby enhancing his business.

With this second loan of US$150 he plans to diversify his stock of bicycle parts to include larger components. Bicycle transportation is the major mode of transportation in this part of the country and demand for spare parts for repair and maintenance is high.
