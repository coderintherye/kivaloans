When she started joining the fund, she invested the loan in breeding animals and got a small profit. However, because of small breeding area, she could not expand her project. During recent years, regional people\u2019s businesses are better than before, thus, carpentry has developed. Mrs. S. discussed with her husband and decided to invest borrowed money to buy wood. Since she changes her activity, her husband does not have to work away from home anymore. She carves the wood into furniture and her husband makes tables and chairs. Her business goes very well. Because of heavy workload, she has to hire 4 more workers.

She has been in this business for more than 30 years. The national dress in Tajikistan is very beautiful and is one of the most important items in the dowry of a girl. Tajikistan is located in Central Asia and the spring is the most beautiful season for this region. When you see all these national dresses it seems that you are admiring the scenery awakening from a cold winter; the green leaves and grasses, bright red and yellow tulips in the mountains, and a blue sky which is so close to you in spring.  <p>\r\nMusharaf has a very good taste and she is ready to advise her clients which textile to choose for this or that occasion. That is why she has customers.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, they require little start-up capital, you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals?

We now plan to expand our business so that we can have a steady source of income and we can save for our daughter\u2019s future.<p>My group members are Shahnaz A., who plans to invest loan in their electric store; Khursheed B., who requires a loan for her son who needs to buy motorcycle spare parts; Rafia S., who requires a loan for their shoe business; Yasmeen K., who needs a loan for her son\u2019s embroidery business. All of these are very cooperative and they strive hard to bring incomes to their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":110869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Open up a

She joined the TYM Fund in 1999 with her first loan of 100USD to invest in the family\u2019s poultry business and the brick manufacturing. In subsequent years, she took out bigger loans and concentrated in poultry farming more. In 2005, the family decided to build a big poultry farm. The business booms. Now she has a flock of 1300 hens for egg and 2000 quails which provides a comfortable income of 200USD monthly. The family\u2019s economy is steady and she has purchased a half acre lot for fruit trees. Mrs  B\u1ea9y would like to take a loan of 950USD to buy feed and invest in a incubator that would avoid sending eggs to other farms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n <p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/>\r\n\r\n<p>M\u1edbi g\u1eb7p ch\u1ecb B\u1ea9y, ai c\u0169ng ng\u1ea1c nhi\u00ean khi th\u1ea5y m\u1ed9t b\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 tr\u1ea1i ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i g\u00e0 v\u00e0 chim c\u00fat v\u00e0o lo\u1ea1i nh\u1ea5t nh\u00ec x\u00e3 T\u00e2n H\u01b0ng l\u1ea1i tr\u1ebb v\u00e0 nh\u1ecf nh\u1eafn \u0111\u1ebfn v\u1eady.

It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":111558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional stock of rice, beans, and charcoal in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-10T01:45:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chiku","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-24T03:34:11Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-02-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":141476,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":165233,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190948,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218512,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247499,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276148,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305698,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-25T07:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336706,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":23,"local_amount":25090.91,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":26841,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":370822,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Sero Lease and Finance Ltd.

You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally. Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.

This is 30 year-old Eisha N..  She is married with three children aged 7 and 9, and has two other dependents who are her niece and nephew.\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Eisha established a livestock business and in 2007, added a grocery business to her workload.  Eisha has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now requires a loan of $850 in order to purchase additional stock in bulk.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nEisha is a perfect example of why microfinance works and why the large majority of clients repay their loans.  A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time, ask anxiously, \u201cBut how do you make sure people pay back?  Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d  The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually the \u2018poor\u2019) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people.  Whether or not this is true is somewhat irrelevant for a number of reasons.  \r\n\r\nFirstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk.  More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive.  The incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026 The incentive to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":111842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase additional livestock and grocery stocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-09T17:45:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-23T22:43:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-02-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":141492,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":165249,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190964,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218528,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247515,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276164,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305713,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":83529.41,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83638,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336721,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":70,"local_amount":82352.94,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":82460,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":370837,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Sero Lease and Finance Ltd.

One of the advantages of having this business is that it is located in an area ov about three and a half acres where there are only two shops, therefore there are many customers.  Like many similar shops, Dona Norma sells to her customers on credit, but only to those that are good payers, since in the past some were slow with the business.
