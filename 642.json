The eldest child is in class one and the second child is not of school-going age yet. Her husband works in the factory at a meager income. In order to fulfill the needs of her family, Samina does embroidery. She is very skillful in her work and receives regular orders every month. She prepares beautiful dresses by crafting beautiful embroidered clothes. She also carries out her responsibilities of a housewife very well and has proved herself as a very responsible housewife. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the further expansion of her embroidery business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. Mirasol earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the unit. Her store is adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMirasol hopes to be able to expand soon.

in 1980 in the town of Kapan where he graduated from secondary school. Davit is married and has two daughters: his oldest daughter is three years old and youngest is one. During working hours the children are looked after by grandmother because Davit's wife works in the Suniksky police department as a warden in the female prison.\r\n\r\nDavit does own business since 2008. On his own KAMAZ truck he transports freights from Kapan to the town of Djulfa in the Iranian republic. In a month Davit makes two trips by route Kapan-Djulfa-Kapan each trip lasting 8-10 days. Davit says that the job of a trucker is very difficult and demands high level of concentration during the entire length of the trip. Davit is proud that because of his business he can support his family. Thanks to the income he receives from the freight transportation he is able to do that.\r\n\r\nDavit needs a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 dram to repair the engine of his KAMAZ vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":446.71,"image":{"id":823989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

she now lives. She was born and raised in the middle income class family and after graduating from school she got married and gave birth to her first son in 1986. To provide for her family with all the necessary things she had to work very hard.\r\n\r\nRight now she has three children - a daughter and two sons. Her youngest son and daughter go to school. In 2004 Mavluda decided to start her own business in the trade of consumer goods. When she began her business with a starting capital of 20,000 soms (KGS) she was able to develop her business and to this day her monthly profit is around 10,000 soms.\r\n\r\nMavluda's small trade pavilion with a size of two by three meters is very popular due to a good variety of products offered, but unfortunately it does not allow to increase the volume of sales. This is why Mavluda decided to come to Bai Tushum and Partners to ask for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to increase the variety of her products.

","en":"Enith is 65 years old and lives in Polo Nuevo, located in the northeast zone of the Department of the Atlantic, in the geological basin of the Magdalena River. She lives there with her husband and has 2 children. She is in the retail traD.. She sells a variety of merchandise on a retail basis from a sales point located on a highly traveled road, which is good for her sales volume. Enith started her business in 2006 when she became unemployed, and thanks to the initiative of her daughter who already had this kind of business, she began to sell products ordered from specialty catalogs. She bought a display case and stocked it with products provided by her daughter. Gradually she built up some capital, which she used to add shoes, women's clothing and other products in demand among her domestic customers. Currently, she sells retail on a cash basis and also on credit based on orders from her customers, with whom she works out the form of payment. Her goal for the future is to expand her business until it becomes a well-known store in Polo Nuevo, stocked with everything that the local inhabitants need and are able to buy. With her Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she will buy paper goods and clothing products, for which there is very little competition in the village, and which will make her investment successful.

At first they stayed with her brother-in-law, then after three months she rented a shop and worked for the next five years at generating an income for the family. After that she, her husband and her bother launched the business that they still run today, making and selling bread for the shops and businesses in the community. \n\nHer dream for the future is that her children should achieve a personal and professional education. She would also like to build a second floor so that she can separate their living and working spaces.  \n\nCurrently her business has a one-day inventory turnover, because her product is purchased daily. She sells daily to her client base which is made up of bread distributors who arrive at her business with their motorcycles or bicycles to fill up their baskets, and from there they go from business to business to sell bread throughout the city. They buy the bread on credit every afternoon, and when they have finished selling that day or the following morning they pay Mariela.

Last year she felt motivated to help her husband with the household finances and she had a personal need to feel useful for her family. So she decided to start selling cheese with her husband in a community where they used to live. They have many acquaintances, friends, and family there who supported their initiative and continue to do so to date. They are their primary market and they have also acquired as clients the employees of the company where he works and other referred clients who now know about the quality of their products. When built her business she decided to let her creativity run free and she began selling cheese fingers packaged in small bundles. She took advantage of the fact that the primary product is cheese and it is a product that she buys in larger quantities. This is another business that earns a second source of income and it has done very well. She also sells complimentary products that she prepares, such as frozen fruit snacks. She prepares them with natural fruits from the region, such as soursop, mango, coconut, and even chocolate. Her greatest dream is to give her business a better infrastructure and to be able to support the person and professional development of her family. As she works towards her goals she works with a contribution margin of 61.29%. She is very eager to increase her working capital to expand her products. This is exactly the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, a first time loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With it she will purchase kitchen implements such as a galvanized steel table, a heated display, and a pizza oven. She will be able to profit from her husband's technical knowledge with respect to the preparation of these products. She plans to have an affect on the community especially because there is not much competition in their neighborhood and surrounding areas. Her goal is to generate more income.

Every morning for the first hours of the day she works in a support program set forth by the Peruvian government named \"Construyendo Peru\", meaning \"Building Peru\". She cleans the streets of her community. The geography of the district is rugged terrain, meaning that the hillsides or slopes and the grasslands prevent the transit of its inhabitants. Faustina works arduously to help the population in her locality. In the afternoons she sets out very eagerly to work in the cultivation she has maintained for 20 years, planting carrots, potatoes, corn, and lettuce. Later on she sells the produce in the central market of the city of Tarma. She also raises and feeds small rabbits for later resale. What she most enjoys is working together with her family on their plantation. She is saving money to buy a house of their own. She is a member of the communal bank \"La Union Hace la Fuerza\", meaning \"Strength comes from Unity\" and it is her fourth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She is happy to be part of this organization, finding happiness and progress. She also learns to improve more every day.

His goal for later on is to finish getting his Law degree and help his family with his business.  While this occurs, Carlos works with one employee that he pays daily.

In other words, he wants to have his own fields.\r\n\r\nHe requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.  It will allow him to buy fruit from wholesale providers.  They give him a cheaper price than what he now pays.  That way he will be able to be more competitive, and his margin of earnings will be bigger.\r\n\r\nDar\u00edo really likes spending time with his daughter and his mother.

Her business is a nixtamal [hominy] mill, which is giving her good profits. It is used to grind corn, rice, beans, chocolate, and various flours, among other substances. She also has a tortilla business which helps her to completely cover the needs of her household. She has built up a large customer base, since she always offers the best service in her mill, and she sells the most delicious tortillas in the area at affordable prices. All of this keeps her very busy, but she says that she is compensated by having found a way to provide daily sustenance for her children. Gilma is an enterprising woman who is always ready to work. She thinks that real heroism consists in persevering more than just a moment, and she wants to persevere always. For this reason, she decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL which will allow her to buy corn on a wholesale basis, since she currently buys it retail, resulting in a price which is quite high. In addition, she would like to do some maintenance on her mill: changing the belts, buying new disks, and renewing some parts which have been worn down by use, so that she can maintain her business. Gilma Alicia is confident that in this way she will be able to give her family a better quality of life.

She thanks you for your support. As a borrower, to improve living standards, extra training is needed. Over 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.
