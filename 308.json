C. is from the city of Maquilao Tangub City. She is 46 years old. Crisanta is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Crisanta owns & operates a business making & selling banana cue. Crisanta has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Crisanta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Crisanta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. Crisanta is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Crisanta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Nicaraguan families use this method of cooking a lot because they do not have sufficient resources to buy stoves.\r\n\r\nM\u00e1ximo\u2019s dream is to expand his business into more rural areas.  That way he could supply many more regions.  The loan is for working capital. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She was born in Magburaka about 37 years ago. Her husband works at the Government hospital and her three children are in Junior Secondary School and primary school, respectively.

She is married and the mother of 4 children.  For the past 10 years she has sold plastic items like:  bathing tubs, buckets, glasses, plates, etc.  Rosa had been cooperating with the Pro Mujer family for the past 4 years but, due to travel, had been absent for some time.  However, now she has returned to form part of the Joyitas de Alto Lima group, a new group, and she wants to continue to see her business grow.  She needs a loan to buy plastic bathing tubs since this is her highest-selling item.  Rosa's fellow group members also have various lines of work and all of them need to buy merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

T., 44, lives with her two daughters and her little granddaughter in a community called Canalete, which is located in Upala in the Alajuela province.  This is a semi-mountainous area whose primary economic activity is agriculture, especially cattle raising.  It is a community rich in opportunities for development and microenterprise establishment, both in agroindustry and in commerce.  Yamma Rosa sells prepared meals; she has a business called a \"soda\" (a small restaurant that serves indigenous dishes) in downtown Upala.  She rents space there to carry out her project.  She says this allows her to meet her household expenses and it also makes her happy to have her own business since it has been well received.  She needs a 680,000 colon loan to buy merchandise to sell and to make up her dishes.  She hopes that this financing will help her business grow and generate good profits since she would like to set up her business in her own site and not have to pay rent anymore, besides offering a better service to her neighbors and tourists who pass through the area.  Yamma Rosa is a member of the Canalete Communal Credit Company, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA, Costa Rica.  This will be her fourth loan and she expects to continue growing personally and economically with it besides actively participating again in a community credit organization.<br

Elizabeth is very happy with her business, and even though she has to travel for four hours she doesn\u2019t mind as it is profitable and, thanks to these profits, her children do not suffer from a lack of necessities.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is very grateful that with her first loan from MFP she was able to use the capital for her vegetable business, for which she committed and fulfilled to her fellow members of the communal bank to be punctual in the payments.  The loan that she asks for now will be invested in the purchase of chemical fertilizers and to increase the amount of vegetables that she sells.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by William Gray, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":428800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"The purchase of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-17T22:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2026.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886583,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T02:26:59Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153913,"name":"Ener","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ener es un hombre muy laborioso de 31 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado y es padre de dos hijos, con los que vive en su casa propia.\n\nPor m\u00e1s de 16 a\u00f1os se dedica a la extracci\u00f3n de madera de las zonas m\u00e1s rec\u00f3nditas y  profundas de la selva peruana y desde que se cas\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n empez\u00f3 a sembrar caf\u00e9 en las chacras de sus suegros.

For over 16 years he has worked extracting lumber from the deepest and most hidden areas of the Peruvian jungle.  Since he got married, he also began to plant coffee on his in-laws' farmlands.  What he likes to do most on his spare time (while they are waiting for harvesting), though, is to fell trees.  He does this from 4am until 2pm and then, with great speed, agility in his hands and dexterity in handling his machines, he cuts them into lumber according to the measurements and sizes requested.  He is able to deliver his orders quickly and this provides him with good earnings.  He is the only one in town that does this which makes it very profitable since all his neighbors require the service in order to build their wood houses.  This is his second loan with MFP so he, once again, commits to continue to work with the same degree of responsibility and punctuality in his repayments.

He lives with his family in his own house.  He cultivates coffee plants, pineapples and bananas on his own farmlands.  Of all the products, the most difficult one is the pineapple which must be worked for 9 months, fertilized and fumigated, because in times of reaping it can be harvested up to three times.  Because of that, Gencys doesn't find it tiring no matter how much work it entails.  With this harvest, added to the coffee gleaning, his family does not suffer economic hardships so he is thinking about increasing his plantings as well as perhaps going into motorcycle sales because in his town mobility is lacking.  With his first loan he was able to plant pineapple on his farmland and with this second loan he wants to fortify the soil and he promisses to repay on time as he's always done to date.

She lives alone in the city of Lambayeque, which is 20 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  She has operated a restaurant in her home since 2002.  She tells us that the business began as a  picanter\u00eda (a low-cost eatery specializing in beverages and small bites) which little by little she was able to enlarge.  A short time ago she had a pre-heart attack and she had to temporarily stop work because she needed absolute rest.  Unfortunately, after that health crisis she was diagnosed with diabetes but, far from being discouraged, the illness was the motivation for her to continue forward and a few months ago she reopened her eatery offering her customers prepared meals a la carte.  The income she earns is used for personal expenses and to maintain her business.  Ruth prepares very tasty dishes so her customers have refered her to others who are starting to frequent her small restaurant.  This situation has motivated her to want to enlarge her establishment but she lacks the funds to buy more ingredients to prepare more dishes.  This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for her first, 1000 new sol, loan.  She dreams with overcoming her illness so that she can renovate the furnishings of her establishment making it into a great restaurant.  Ruth is very well-known and held in high esteem by her neighbors who consider her to be an optimistic and hard-working woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

He takes care of moves, and hauls anything else that his customers request. His wife is a homemaker who takes care of their children when he is not home. He is requesting this loan for repairs to his truck, as much use has left worn and in need of repair. Ruperto also has a car which he uses for taxi work, bringing in additional income for his family. Every day he goes to work with his truck; working from a stop at Mercadito de Los Pocitos, very close to his home. He chose this place as it is near the shops that sell bricks, cement, and related items which often need to be transported. From time to time he makes longer trips to other departments, hauling cargo for some of his customers. He is very proud of the work that he is doing, as he knows that he is setting a good example for his children.

Feliciana's dishes are very tasty because she has always liked to cook, an activity which is very enjoyable for her, although sometimes she has so many diners that she can barely take care of them all.  On the other hand, being able to be so close to home allows her to watch over her children and this keeps her happy and worry-free.  Currently, her business is producing good profits but she thinks it would be more useful to open a restaurant in her home; she would have more space and be able to provide more comfort for her clientele.  She is working hard toward achieving this goal.  This is Feliciana's first loan with MFP and she commits to being very responsible with repayment.  With the funds she is requesting now she will buy larger quantities of ingredients to prepare her meals so that she can have more customers and have her business grow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":428991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients for her prepared meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T04:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":227.87},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":237.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":244.86},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":252.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":264.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":271.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.2},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.75,"local_amount":227.87,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":230.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843194,"comment":null},{"amount":162.95,"local_amount":465.57,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":471.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734784,"comment":null},{"amount":5.95,"local_amount":16.99,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":17.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124126,"comment":null},{"amount":88.5,"local_amount":252.85,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":256.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959848,"comment":null},{"amount":92.73,"local_amount":264.94,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":268.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992693,"comment":null},{"amount":95.12,"local_amount":271.78,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":275.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T05:58:06Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153967,"name":"Lidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lidia es una entusiasta mujer de 38 a\u00f1os, vive con Andr\u00e9s, su pareja de 41, y con sus 2 hijos: Carlos de 17 y  Brigitte de 12.

operates a small boot-making shop in her town with the help of her husband. She worked in a shoe factory for five years and gained much experience and skill in her trade. She specializes in making warm winter boots for herders, so the winter season is especially busy for her. B. started her boot-making business in 2005 and has managed it successfully over the years. She is a very hardworking and open-minded businesswoman and always looks for ways to grow and expand her business. Her success has enabled her to build a house for her family and improve their quality of life. \r\n<p>\r\nZonorov B. is 33 years old and lives with her husband and four children in Hovd province in western Mongolia. Her oldest daughter and son, ages 11 and 9, currently attend a local secondary school. Her youngest two sons are both in kindergarten. \r\n<p>\r\nB. has many plans for the future. She hopes to soon expand her production line by producing summer work and dress shoes. She hopes diversifying her products will increase her overall sales and stabilize her income throughout the year. As demand continues to increase for her boots, B. needs to expand her production capacity and purchase new machinery. She hopes that one day she will be able to provide quality boots to customers throughout her province. B. is requesting a 3,000,000 tugrug loan to purchase two shoe-making machines and different types of leather for her shoe-making business.\r\n<p>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Evangeline joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. She is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her fourth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Orang Cabgan,Tambulig, Zamboanga DelSur. She is 51 years old. Zucima is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Zucima owns and operates a venture business  in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling wild-caught fish in the local community. Zucima has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 8,000 a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Zucima joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Zucima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fish to raise and sell in the future. Zucima is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to raise. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Zucima from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

However, due to lack of capital, it did not survive, so she was forced to close it because she couldn't meet the demands of her customers. \r\n\r\nShe then decided to venture into the hog-raising business which is located in their back yard. With the small capital from her store, she purchased a few hogs. She hopes to increase her number of hogs but she needs more capital. She is hoping that Kiva lenders will give her the chance to make her business productive by lending her 10,000 PHP. This will be of great help in making her business profitable.

He is a baker.  His workday begins very early in the morning, at about 4:30am, when he gets up to start kneading the dough and making the bread which everyone in the neighborhood enjoys.  Adolfo is a very skilled baker because he learned the craft as a little boy from his father.  What he most likes about the job is baking bread which he does with great care.  He has had this occupation for 30 years and he considers the most difficult part having to get up so early in the morning every day since for him there is no such thing as weekends or holidays.  For later in the future, he would like to set up a store to sell the bread that he himself bakes.  This is his first loan with MFP and he doesn't want to fail to repay it for lack of money so he is willing to save day by day to repay it.  Besides, he is very responsible and respectful toward the other members.  With the one-thousand soles requested he will buy new baking sheets and stands for his bread and he will also get his oven repaired.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":429130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":126.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843197,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734788,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124129,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":126.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959852,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992697,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":126.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717481,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":126.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751205,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":126.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933761,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T08:53:29Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154013,"name":"Mercedita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercedita B. is from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin.

T., 39 years old, like most women entrepreneurs in the Philippines, earns a lot from buying and selling cosmetics items and apparel from prominent direct-selling companies like Avon, Sundance, Natasha, Marikina Shoe Exchange, etc. This is a tried and tested source of income for housewives.\r\n\r\nRosalita\u2019s family lives in Maricaban, Pasay City. Her husband Reynaldo, also 39, is an architectural designer. They have two children: one in college and the other in high school. Rosalita virtually became both father and mother to her children for thirteen years already because her husband works overseas.\r\n\r\nRosalita enjoys going to her friends on a house-to-house basis to sell her items. She earns P16,000 a month and even more during holiday seasons. From her profits, which she saves, she was able to purchase a piece of land in the nearby province.\r\n\r\nRosalita has been with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative since 2002. The loans provided by the cooperative helped her to pay for cosmetic items from the dealers in cash (when she can pay them on a consignment basis) so she could obtain large discounts and rebates which she also infuses back to her business. Currently, she is applying for a P35,000 loan from CCT to obtain more cosmetics items from her dealer in anticipation of the upcoming Christmas season.\r\n\r\nRosalita wishes her husband would stay with them for good and find work here in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents

Her empanadas are highly sought after by people, which explains why she receives many orders.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat Flavia enjoys most about her work is the freedom it provides.  After she finishes making empanadas, she takes advantage of the time to pursue other activities to earn more income.

She lives in the house of one of her family members together with her 20 year old husband, R\u00f3mulo.  Just a few days ago they had their first child, and they want to give him a good life.\r\n\r\nTogether with her inseparable tricycle, she leaves every morning to sell fruit in the Santa B\u00e1rbara market (an important market in the city of Juliaca).  She is a very charismatic and happy young woman.  This motivates her customers, who prefer to buy from her.  Also, the fruit she sells is very fresh, and it has a very pleasant aroma.  What she likes best about her work is talking with her neighboring sales people.  This makes her long work days more enjoyable.  She has been doing this for three years.  The most difficult part is having to stay under the intense sun the whole day.  In time, she hopes to have a stand in the market where she can sell her products more calmly.\r\n\r\nThis is Luzmila\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She is prepared to pay it back completely in order to have access to a new one.  She completely trusts her colleagues in her communal bank, where she is much loved.  She will use the 1,000 PEN to buy more fruit to better stock her tricycle and offer a greater variety to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":429151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T14:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843202,"comment":null},{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-20T10:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":338.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734793,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959857,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992702,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":167.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717486,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T17:04:31Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154027,"name":"Lelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lelia D. is from the village of Opol , Misamis Oriental.

He has been in this business for five years.  The most difficult part is cutting the fabric without making a mistake.  Any slight error could ruin a whole day\u2019s work and cost him a lot of money.

Fe is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Fe from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":429171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

Her profits go to the education of her children as well as to the family\u2019s basic daily needs.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, she joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  She has recently applied for a new loan in the amount of PHP 42, 000.00.  She will use the funds to purchase supplies for her parlor\/salon. \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  CCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":428297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase supplies for the beauty salon.

T. is from the village of Mison, Baliangao, Misamis Occidental. She is 28 years old. Everlyn is married and has 3 infants. Everlyn's main source of income comes from operating a clothing business. Everlyn has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Everlyn joined GDMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Everlyn is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase more ready made clothing for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Everlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vergie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Now requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional equipment for buying shells for sale, she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support extended members of the family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is a good mother who is committed to improve the living conditions of her family through hard work, perseverance and love. This is the life path that she has chosen for herself and her family. Erlinda is a 49 year old married woman who lives in the village of Brgy. Gargato, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Her husband is a tricycle driver and also operates their motorized fishing boat - locally known as a pumpboat. They have eight children who are between 15 to 35 years old with the younger ones still attending school. Having been blessed with eight children, they knew they had to work hard to provide for their large family, especially in terms of preparing them to be independent and have their own livelihoods when they are grown. \r\n\r\nWhat should have been a difficult situation became an opportunity for Erlinda to help her husband support their family, and with the help of NWTF Project Dungganon, she was able to get enough capital to earn a respectable living for their family. Years ago, Erlinda was actually starting to worry how they could support and educate eight kids, but with determination, she started selling her husband's catch to her neighbors, going as far as the nearby villages just so she could sell the fish her husband caught each day. Then, as she developed good relationships with her customers, she also sold dried fish to them.\r\n\r\nBecause she wanted to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 to access additional capital without pawning any of their meager properties. With the help of her loans, she was able to buy additional materials for her fishing business and was able to buy more for her fish vending business. Her business continued to improve and now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000, which is quite enough to support their needs with some left over for savings.\r\n\r\nIn her last loan she borrowed Php 19,500 which she used to add to her working capital and also paid for maintenance work on their fishing boat. The loan was paid in weekly installments and was fully paid within her loan term without any delays. Now she is borrowing her tenth cycle loan for the same amount of Php 19,500, which she will use as additional working capital for her businesses. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

D. is a young and strong 60-year-old who loves running her business and is happy to be earning a daily income from her business operations. She lives in the village of Brgy. 111, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is married to a motorcycle driver and they have three children who are between 21 and 30 years old. Noly has always dreamed of a more comfortable life for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nShe had to do something to help her husband earn a living because his income from driving a motorcycle, shuttling passengers, was just not sufficient to sustain their family. So Noly started her own eatery, offering different kinds of food to her regular customers. In spite of the small income she earned from this business, she persisted because it helped their food needs.\r\n\r\nTo improve her business and be able to earn a bigger income, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon 2001. With the additional capital from her loans, she was soon able to expand her business to include a general store. She has been in business for over 25 years already, but it is only now with the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon that she is finally achieving some success in her business. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000 from her business operations, allowing her to set aside some savings for their future.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed Php 17,000 and used it as working capital for her eatery and to buy more stock for her general store. Even at her age, she maintains her good credit performance by paying her loan in full and on time without any delays. Now she is borrowing for her 16th cycle loan, the same amount of Php 17,000 to be used to buy motorcycle spare parts to repair her husband's source of his livelihood and also as additional capital for her general store and eatery.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":428341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To

is a 45-year-old married mother of nine children between the ages of 12 and 28. Five of her children go to school. She owns a three-room house where she lives with ten people. Joyce takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity and piped water and gets three meals a day.  She incurs transportation costs to and from Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala city. She works in a semi-urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. Joyce works six days a week, receiving an average of four customers a day. She works with all categories of people. \r\n<p>\r\nJoyce owns a ladies' beauty salon in Mengo Kisenyi. Her major business challenges include the ever-increasing prices of hair conditioners and hair extensions as well as the rainy season, which hinders her customers coming to her because she works from a muddy place. Her monthly expenses include rent for her business premises, feeding the family and medication.  She has been in this business for twenty years and with MCDT for four years, now servicing her 8th loan. \r\n<p>\r\nJoyce joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was easy to work with the people. She wants to use this loan to buy more boxes of hair conditioners and extensions. She is hoping to see her business grow bigger and would like to start a bridal salon.\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.49,"image":{"id":429366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She is 48 years old and is married to Jerry S., who works as a farmer. She has 8 children; one already has his own family, and the rest are still attending school. As a mother, she would like to secure the future of her children by making sure that they have very good jobs and enough earnings to support the needs of their own families when they decide to settle down. \r\n\r\nMa. Luz got married at only 19 years old because she wanted to be free of her parents' strictness. When she had her own family, she encountered a lot of hardships and problems on how to cope with their daily living. She knew that her husband's income as a farmer was not enough for them. When their first baby was born, Ma. Luz tried other ways to earn other income like putting up a small general store at the front of her house while raising ducks in her backyard. In spite of the additional business, they still encountered problems; still, they persevered.   \r\n\r\nIn 2001 Ma. Luz was able to join NWTF-Project Dungganon, which gave her additional capital for their business. With the loan, she was able to buy additional ducks to raise so that she could then sell the eggs to their neighbors. As loans continued, she learned how to handle her money. She was also able to invest in pig fattening, acquire a farmland and buy a water buffalo for their farm. Twenty six years later, Ma.Luz is more knowledgeable on how to manage her businesses. She now earns PHP 10,000 per month. Most of the profit is put in a savings account to support the education of their children and to help with the family expenses.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, Ma. Luz borrowed PHP 13,000. Said loan was paid in full and on time. Now, while on her 18th cycle, she is asking for a loan of PHP 15,000. She will use the money to buy additional ducks to raise and egg trays for the delivery of eggs. The resulting income will be used to improve her family's living conditions, pay for her children's education and renovate her house.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 35 years old, married, and has 2 children aged nine and fourteen years old who are presently attending school. She works hard because she wants to give her children all they need, including good food, an education and a good family to support them when they grow up.  She also wants to help her husband earn additional income for their family.\r\n\r\nIn the past, she was a plain housewife whose main day-to-day activity was to take good care of her children and husband. She would wait for her husband to bring home his salary and then budget it for the week.  However, she noticed that the budget was never enough for the whole week. She thought of trying to start a business so she could earn money and help her husband, which is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon.   Having some capital to invest in business, Ma. Lourdes decided to try her luck with a ready-to-wear and used clothing business. She goes to different places to sell her goods. She wakes up early to go to market and sell her wares so that she can earn more income. From her business, she is able to earn PHP 10,000 every month, which is a big help to her family, especially for the education of her two children.\r\n\r\nMa. Lourdes\u2019 previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used to buy additional clothes, both ready-to-wear and used. Because the funds went toward her business, she was able to maintain a good credit rating by paying her previous loan on time and in full, without any delay. Now, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing the same amount of PHP 19,500, which she will use for her business, to save for her children\u2019s education, and for household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Ma. Lourdes is involved in her business during market day.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned its respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":429373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"additional working capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T20:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

She is 46 years old and married. She has five children, two of whom have already graduated from college as nurses. She is working hard for the future of her three remaining children whom they continue to send to school.\r\n\r\nJasmin started her business by baking foods like pastries and cakes.  It is a trade she learned years ago and discovered that she has the knack for. She started selling these foods to her community and other neighboring villages. She also accepted orders for her baked goods. But in the year 2001, she needed additional capital to buy ingredients for her business so that she could accommodate all the orders. Luckily, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to address her need of additional capital. She was able to buy ingredients so she could meet all her deadlines for the orders. \r\n<p>\r\nAs her loan continued, she also started a cross-stitch business.  With the knowledge she acquired on how to do cross-stitch, she was able to make beautiful, neat and clean products. The new business has contributed to her income. For the two businesses, she is able to earn about $220 a month.  She saves most of her income to support the education of her children and the rest is used to support the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nA previous loan of 27,000 PHP was used as additional working capital for her baked products and cross-stitch businesses. Because of her success, she was able to maintain her good credit performance with NWTF-Project Dungganon. She was able to pay off the loan in full and on time. Now on her 16th cycle loan, with the same amount of 27,000 PHP, Jasmin will buy additional materials for her cross-stitch and baked goods businesses. Whatever income she gets will be used for the education of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":429231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy

Koutiala (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 Not having had the chance to go to school, she soon got interested in the commerce of a variety of goods and in the processing of <i>n\u00e9r\u00e9<\/i> nuts into <i>sounbala<\/i>.\u00a0 Fatoumata has been in this processing business for over thirty years.\u00a0 She is much appreciated and enjoys great distinction in Koutiala and the vicinity.\u00a0 <i>Sounbala<\/i> is essential for making certain sauces in West Africa, and this speaks to the importance and the advantages of this business, which brings in a fair amount of revenue to those in it. \r\n\r\nTo remedy the sundry shortages which she suffers and which cause her to lose customers, Fatoumata decided five years ago to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso to satisfy her customers properly.\u00a0 After eight solidarity loans (group loans), all properly repaid, she is now on her sixth individual loan.\u00a0 These previous loans have all been repaid.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe intends to buy 10 sacks of <i>n\u00e9r\u00e9<\/i> nuts.\u00a0 Supplies are gotten at the big market of Koutiala.\u00a0 Sales are made in cash or on credit to customers composed essentially of woman in Bamako (capital of Mali).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nWith the boost to her working capital, Fatoumata is hoping for an average profit of 125,000 francs CFA per month that she envisions using to cover the Soro Yiriwaso loan interest, to assist with family expenses, and to support herself, as well as her children.\u00a0 Her ambition is to become a wholesale merchant of condiments in Bamako. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband and children in the Hamdallaye neighborhood in the Koutiala prefecture (Sikasso region of Mali).\r\n\r\nFor socio-economic reasons she did not go to school, and so she became very involved with various commercial activities.  Madame Konat\u00e9 finally opted for the catering trade, which she picked up from her mother.  She has done this for nearly seven years. She is highly sought after in her neighborhood, particularly during the morning when she is very busy.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop and improve her business, Madame Konat\u00e9 wasted no time in turning to micro-finance institution Solo Yiriwaso four years ago.\r\nAfter four group loans, all fully repaid without difficulty, she is now on to her third individual loan, the previous two having been successfully completed.\r\nWith this new loan, she intends to buy five sacks of beans from the grain wholesalers in Koutiala, 10 cases of spaghetti and food condiments. She sells bean fritters and several other prepared foods (e.g., cooked bean seeds, spaghetti)  in front of her house, to a client\u00e8le of both men and women for cash.\r\n\r\nMadame Konat\u00e9 hopes to generate a monthly income of 100,000 FCFA, which she will use to pay the interest to Soro Yiriwaso and to pay her daily household expenses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":429444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients for her catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152388,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021500,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778854,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699301,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180450,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":42266.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476507,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T16:50:09Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154181,"name":"Seynabou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Seynabou S. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 24 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 2 enfants. elle vend de la glace et du pain.En m\u00eame temps Elle travaille en collaboration avec son mari qui est tailleur.

Il jouit d\u2019une grande notori\u00e9t\u00e9 due \u00e0 son de g\u00e9nie de cr\u00e9ation de nouveaut\u00e9s.\nEn plus de cette activit\u00e9 de tailleur, Mamadou Kon\u00e9 fait \u00e9galement de temps \u00e0 autres la commercialisation de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales.\n\nDans le souci  de renforcer  son activit\u00e9, il  a fait recours  au programme cr\u00e9dit de  l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso.

He lives in a traditional extended family with several other families in the Darsalam neighborhood in S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\n\nMamadou abandoned his studies in the third grade of basic school (Malian educational system) for personal reasons. He then started to learn the tailoring trade alongside his uncle for three years.\n\nAfter this stage of his apprenticeship, during which he learned a great deal, he decided to branch out on his own; that was fourteen years ago now. He has a great reputation due to his genius for creating unique items.  In addition to his tailoring business, Mamadou Kon\u00e9 also occasionally sells grain.\n\nIn an effort to improve his business, he has turned to the loan program offered by the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is Mamadou's first individual loan, with which he intends to buy two 20U sewing machines.  He buys his supplies locally in S\u00e9gou. He makes the clothes and sells them for cash or credit to both men and women.\n\nWith this loan he hopes to generate a monthly income of 100,000 FCFA, which will allow him to take care of his expenses (e.g., food, clothing) and provide for the needs of his workshop.\n\nHis ambition is to get into commercial grain storage in S\u00e9gou.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent,

They are on average 45 years old with 5 children and live in the M\u00e9dine district of the town S\u00e9gou (4th administrative area of the Republic of Mali.) They know each other from the neighborhood and family ties. They all do business with various goods. It is in the hopes of increasing and varying their business that they decided to work with the micro-finance non-profit Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter six repaid team loans, the Yelenkoura group is on to its 7th loan. This loan would be used to buy food condiments (4 large boxes of condensed tomatoes, 2 bags of cooking salt, 1 box on bouillon cubes, 20 kg of dah seeds) ; various goods to display ( 1 bag of sugar, about ten packets of tea that is highly regarded by their customers, 4 boxes laundry soap, 1\/2 box mosquito repellent spirals); 40 bags of charcoal; 4 bags of millet, 1 bag of powdered baobab fruit and the ingredients for dried cream.\r\n<p>\r\nThey supply themselves with the food condiments and various goods in Bamako, the charcoal is made on site, the carriers for large goods come from Fana. The millet and the powdered baobab fruit come from the market in Medine. To make dried cream: you must grind the millet to a fine flour, roast a part of this millet, remove the bran, and wash it well. To that we add oven-dried rice and powdered baobab fruit and sift it several times. Add the needed ingredients and reduce them to a flour. Mix well and let them dry in required hygienic conditions. The seeds of the dah are modified into \"datou\" used in our sauces instead of \"sounbala.\"\r\n<p>\r\nThe sales are done from home, in the from of house deliveries, at market, and retail by cash or credit. The customers are made up of both women and men. They hope to earn on average 55.00 FCFA monthly, which would repay the interest on the loan, cover the cost on the goods, the purchase of school stationary and soap, and enable them to participate in social events. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Colleen Creegan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":429499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"The purchase of varrious goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou     \t       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Penda      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763561,"comment":null},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152392,"comment":null},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991234,"comment":null},{"amount":246.42,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021504,"comment":null},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746306,"comment":null},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778858,"comment":null},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.84,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961107,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T19:34:34Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154215,"name":"Akram","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K. Akram is a good father, hard working, and steadfast in his endeavors as a farmer and in raising animals. Thanks to his wife\u2019s assistance (pictured), he is able to care and feed the animals for sale later at both fairs and marketplaces in nearby towns. Traveling to nearby towns increases his costs, but that is offset by the higher asking price he gets there. For this reason, Akram and his wife take care to feed them properly in order to bring in more profit. Nevertheless, they would now like to increase the number of cattle. In order to buy cattle he needs a loan of $1500 USD and promises to be responsible and prompt in repaying it.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She believes that if you love your family, you must do everything for their sake. This is the reason why she works so hard - to help her husband provide for the needs of their six children between ages 1 and 11.  The three oldest already attend school. Her aspirations are to provide a comfortable life for her family and send her children to school to prepare them for a better future.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband make their dream a reality, she started a general store.  Even with a small income, she knew she was helping her husband, so she continued her efforts and tried to offer more goods to her customers. To further increase her income potential, she started with a door-to-door vending business selling different kinds of root crops, vegetables, and fruits because these were abundant in her locality.\r\n\r\nWhen demand for her goods increased, she realized that she needed additional capital just to be able to maintain enough inventory, so she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002. With the help of successive loans which she was able to pay off quickly, her business improved even further, and she was able to earn a net monthly income of PHP 18,000 on average. She has started to set aside some of her income for the future of her children.\r\n\r\nFor her 13th cycle loan she borrowed PHP 22,000 which was utilized as additional capital for her general store and door-to-door vending. Her loan was paid on a weekly basis and it was fully paid without any delay. Now she is borrowing for her 14th cycle, the amount of PHP 23,000, as additional capital for her business once again. The income she earns from it will be used to make improvements to her general store structure and as additional capital for her door-to-door vending.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":429463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To make improvements to her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T07:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":23000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.24},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.38,"local_amount":5308,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5396.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849023,"comment":null},{"amount":76.93,"local_amount":3538.16,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3597.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739691,"comment":null},{"amount":153.84,"local_amount":7076.92,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7195.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129111,"comment":null},{"amount":115.39,"local_amount":5307.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5396.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965907,"comment":null},{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":1769.23,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997820,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-21T16:19:05Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154221,"name":"Na We Say Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Adama K., Mamusu F. and Saffie M., members of the Na We Say Group.

Himaya, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is 46 years-old, married, works as a farmer and a mother of eight children, seven of whom are attending school. The eldest child is already working. Belinda is striving hard to send her children to school and is doing everything she can to help her husband increase their family income to support their family. She hopes that someday through her hardwork, perseverance and dedication she can improve their living.\r\n<p>\r\nTo achieve these dreams and make them a reality, she looked for a business where she could earn a good income to help support the needs of the family. At first, she bought one pig to fatten and sell, but she then realized that pig-fattening took three to four months to earn an income. In 2002, she joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon to invest in farming. The loans that Belinda has received have been used in pig fattening and farm supplies. As the loans she was allowed to borrow grew, she bought farming equipment such as a hand tractor and a rice thresher to make the farming  more efficient. Belinda has now been in business for more than seven years and she earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. She saves most of her profits for the education of her children, their household expenses and unexpected farm expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nBelinda's previous loan of Php 29,000 was used as additional capital for pig fattening and maintenance of her farm equipment. The loan was fully paid on-time maintaining her standing as a good member of NWTF-Project Dungganon.

is an entrepreneurial man and lives with his wife and three children who all help him in the business of production and sale of national bread \u201clepeshka\u201d. He began his business to help with household expenses and at the same time to cover the costs of study of his children and their basic upkeep. He began his business five years ago by selling in both his house and on the market, counting already an almost fixed clientele. Valam is asking for a loan of $1500 to buy flour, coal and other products to increase the production of lepeshka in order to give better attention to his clients. Valam and his family thank you very much for the help which you give him in being able to follow through in creating his business and being able to continue with it in the future.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikstan's independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged Tajikstan's already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She receives an average of 35 customers a day and sells to all categories of people, both in wholesale and retail. She has a stall selling bananas in Nakawa Market. Her major business challenges are thieves and the ever-increasing prices of bananas due to persistent drought in many villages of Uganda. She has been in this business for over ten years and with MCDT for eight years, currently servicing her twentieth loan. Besides this banana business, she also sells beer at her home. Angella joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was easy to work with. She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas and crates of beer.
