She is 49 years old. Betty is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is A.'s Group.\r\n\r\nBetty is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Betty owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Betty has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Betty joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Betty has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Betty is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Betty from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Vita has been engaged in her business for over 1 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Vita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Vita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":464023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

S. is from the village of Sta.

Dionita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dionita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dionita is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Dionita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Victoria owns & operates a business raising pigs for sale. Victoria has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Victoria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Victoria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. Victoria is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase piglets to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Victoria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 35 years old, is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Maria Fe owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Maria Fe has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maria Fe joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from GDMPC. Maria Fe is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Maria Fe from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C., 46, is making sure that her family has enough provision for their daily needs. Married to Hilario C., a lead man in construction, they are blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been selling dried fish and frozen meat for nine years.\r\n\r\nGilda has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than eight years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow 15 times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She has been consistent in paying her dues because she used almost all the borrowed money to buy assorted dried fish and meat and resold it in the market. Her business lets her earn a net profit of 19,000 PHP per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of  25,000 PHP. This amount will be mostly used as added capital for her expanding business through buying dried squid, assorted dried fish, chicken, hot dogs and other frozen meat.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that through her business she and her husband can let their children finish their studies so that they can have a good life in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":465263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

Adelina is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Adelina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan that Adelina has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying prime commodity products.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her store could eventually become a mini-grocery and prays for a peaceful and blessed family life. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is divorced and has two children who are 14 and 16 years old. She has been a member of the Yoff savings bank which belongs to U-IMCEC (a mutual loan and savings union) since October 2009. Mrs K.'s specialises primarily in sewing and trading. She ventured into sewing as early as 1973 when she abandoned her studies. Her mother strongly encouraged her in her sewing activity. What pleases her most is the progress she has achieved and also the fabrication of beautiful costumes. Mrs K. has a secondary activity which is the sale of fritters next to her home. She is borrowing 250,000 francs for the acquisition of a second machine. The rest of the money will allow her to buy bags of millet and sugar in order to make the millet-based fritters that she sells. The development of her business and the consequent growth in her profits will allow her to cover her daily expenses and provide financial support for her small family.\r\n\r\nAs part of the ongoing vision to participate actively in the battle against poverty, U-IMCEC, with the backing of its lenders, is successfully supporting people to carry out lucrative revenue-generating activities; this in turn is contributing to a welcome socio-economic development. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":465386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase of working capital and investment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-07T11:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007484,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036556,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759113,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790627,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971067,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708331,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922402,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188905,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484349,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620606,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-07T18:03:45Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167014,"name":"Apollo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

They have a very basic and small home, just one of the many challenges facing those in the Dominican Republic. Potable running water is nonexistent, electricity is scarce, and health care is inadequate at best. Despite these and other challenges, Linda runs a small business selling used clothing to her friends, neighbors, and community. She plans to use this loan, her first with Esperanza International, to purchase packs of clothing which she will sort through and sell for a small profit.\r\n\r\nUnlike many clothing shops, Linda will use a cart to transport her items around town. She hopes that this mobility will give her an edge and add to her sales. With the profits from her business, she hopes to buy items for her children, including backpacks, notebooks, new shoes, and school uniforms. Linda is very grateful for her new access to loans, stating that she is now \u201cmuch more at ease and [feels] valued as a human being\u201d.

Together with her husband and children she primarily grows colored corn.  During the harvest time she sells dried corn in order to transport it to the capitol.  When she starts selecting the corn that will be sold, she contracts the services of several women to do the arduous work all day.  The agricultural product that she offers is very popular because the quality of the corn is good.  This motivates her a lot because she wants to continue in this activity.  It allows her to pay the family expenses and increase her production.  When there is a great demand and she does not have a harvest, she buys from her neighbors to sell.

This is Ms. J.\u2019s second loan cycle as part of the Fundaci\u00f3n after a friend encouraged her to form the collective and informed her about the benefits such a group could receive.  Monica will use the loan provided by FUNDACION ESPOIR to repay some debts. The debts are for the 80 pounds of fish that she buys on credit each week for her fish soup, and to pay off some jewelery she had previously pawned.  Her dream is to buy her own house.             \n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":465480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To pay off debts from buying fish on credit, buy back jewelery from the pawn shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T17:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074661,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074662,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074663,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910649,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910650,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946289,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946290,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674616,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-10T03:14:09Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167054,"name":"Maria Eufemia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal El Cr\u00e9dito es formado por un grupo de mujeres luchadoras que buscan cada d\u00eda la manera de salir en adelante y as\u00ed entregarles un mejor futuro a sus familias, viven por distintas partes de la ciudad de Cuenca, siendo esta la tercera ciudad mas importante del Ecuador, es una ciudad que tiene una belleza natural que enamora a propios y extra\u00f1os.\n\nLa Sra.

Her  business activities are agriculture and the sale of bulls, as well as the cultivation of potato (a Peruvian tuber), corn, and alfalfa which compliments her animal sales.  She mostly sells large quantities of alfalfa which she distributes to shopkeepers.  Every 6 months, she harvests her produce and then sells it.  She also commercializes her bulls, which are quite profitable, so she hopes to have a large stable in the future as well as more land to increase her profits.  This is her fourth loan from MFP and she has continually shown herself to be punctual in her payments \u2013 this loan will not be an exception.  She will use this money to buy fertilizer, insecticide, and sacks of manure in order to plant a larger quantity of alfalfa.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":465493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"She will buy fertilizer and insecticide for her fields.

Alcarrizos, acts as the coordinator for the \"Luz D. Amor\" (Light of Love) group. Iris's story is representative of the other women in this group. \r\n\r\nIris is a single mother who lives alone with her son in L. Alcarrizos, an urban, industrial area that lies in the outskirts of Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital. The area lacks access to potable water, has unreliable electricity, and inadequate sanitation and health care. \r\n\r\nIris came to Esperanza seeking a loan to help expand her beauty shop, Salon Iris. Iris will be using the money from this first loan to purchase twenty hair care products for her customers. In the future, Iris wishes to improve her business by purchasing fans for her salon. \r\n\r\nIris wants to promote the success of her business by saving money to remodel the salon and purchase clothing to sell in the store. Her long term goal is to use the success of her business to support her son.

They have two children Lesly (9) and Miguel (4). They all live in a single family home. For 10 years she has worked growing corn, potatos, peas, and beans on the lands that she inherited from her parents and on some land that she was able to buy. Her husband and children help her care for the plants. What she likes most about her work is planting her land and seeing how the plants flourish. She is able to make a good profit upon selling her crops because these products are in demand at the city market. Sometimes she even sells an entire crop to wholesalers. In the future she hopes to build a house in the city. Also she hopes to grow peas and gladiolus flowers in larger quantities. This is the ninth loan she has had with MFP and she is excited. She likes to work with the community bank because the members of the bank are responsible, punctual, and honorable. With the loan money Celia plans to buy green pea seeds, bags of fertilizers, and two head of cattle to plow her farms.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":465530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purcahse of seeds, fertilizer, and cattle ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-07T18:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2508.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886640,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T13:53:48Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167073,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a businesswoman who makes a living selling clothes, linen and lace.

For eight years her work begins very early, since she plants Peruvian potatoes, corn, and gladiolus flowers with her husband. Similarly she makes breads that she sells from 6 in the morning in her town. She prefers to make breads because she enjoys tasting her pastries. For this couple both activities bring in much profit. They explain that the bakery gives them a daily income while agriculture being seasonal permits them to purchase basic necessities. For the future she plans to open a bakery in the city as well as extend her small food store in her home. She also plans on buying more land and plant greater quantities. This is the ninth loan that she has with MFP. Furthermore, she is very happy with the work being done in her communal bank because she learns quite a lot and shares her experiences about savings and investment issues with the rest of the members. With the loan  she will buy many bags of pea seeds, sacs of fertilizer, and bottles of insecticide so she can properly tend her land.

She is 45 years old, married, and has five children; ages 19, 17, 16, 14, and 11. Her 19-year-old son studies at Salesiana University. Thanks to his father living abroad, her 17-year-old son was able to obtain a visa and moved out of the country. Her 16-year-old son studies in the school Febres Cordero, while her 14-year-old son studies in Miguel Cordero. Finally, her 11-year-old son is studying in the school of the Basilica. Nine years ago, her husband migrated illegally, but he has been able to obtain the necessary documents to work legally. They do not have their own house, but they rent one.\r\n\r\nBrida takes care of the domestic chores but also has been raising chickens for a short time. She has worked with loans from her bank for 10 years now and tells us that it was a promoter who gave her the incentive to become part of this group. The loans that have been granted to her have benefited her a lot, helping to pay her debts and to cover her necessities. With this loan from FUNDACION ESPOIR, she is going to invest in the purchase of more chickens, as well as feed and vitamins for them. Her greatest dream is to eventually have her own house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mark Broscoe, Kiva

Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town with a tourism-based economy where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her longtime partner and her three children.\r\n\r\nMaria is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loans. She plans to use this loan to invest in her clothing sales business by purchasing a dozen pairs of panties, a half dozen bras and a half dozen blouses in the main market in Santiago, then returning to her neighborhood to sell them to her clients at a profit. She will also use the loan to purchase a sewing machine, so that she can customize her clothes.

An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":465097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

Nancy spends her time performing household chores, but she also raises pigs, cows, and chickens.  Most of these animals are for personal consumption since there is little grass as a result of the drought in the region.  She is participating in her eighth loan cycle with the Foundation.  Nancy feels at peace because the loans have helped her household.  Her mother was the person responsible for convincing her to join the Communal Bank.

They have three children; Yeson is 21, Yudy is 18, and Marita is 14.  This family lives in a small house, which is their own.\r\n\r\nFor 24 years he has been cultivating peas, corn, potatoes (Peruvian tuber), and different colors of gladiola flowers.  He inherited the land from his parents.  His wife and children help him cultivate the land.  What he likes best about his work is harvesting the potatoes and flowers, which sell rapidly in the wholesale market in the city.  This activity allows him to live comfortably and to provide an adequate education for his children.  With the earnings he also is able to get animals like livestock, horses, and donkeys.  These make his farming work easier.\r\n\r\nHis desires to progress have made him think of buying more land and planting in greater quantity in the future.  Most of all, he will do this with peas because he invests a small amount and gets good earnings in less time.\r\n\r\nThis is his ninth loan with MFP, and he knows that he will be punctual and responsible as always.  He will use the money from the loan to buy bags of pea seeds, organic fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer to take care of his land.  This investment comes to approximately 2,500 PEN. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":465764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds and organic and chemical fertilizers for his land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-09T18:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2508.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886647,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T22:27:27Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167147,"name":"Elmer","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elmer tiene 38 a\u00f1os y cuya familia esta constituida por su esposa y sus tres hijos, y juntos viven en su propia casa.

Minh has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 1,800,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2004, Minh joined Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Minh is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her ninth from Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women. Minh plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About the other borrowers in the group<\/b><br>\r\n1.  T.

P., 39, is a hard working single mom. She has one child who is in grade school and she makes sure that she earns enough for their everyday living expenses.  She has been making and selling processed food for ten years. She also directly sells clothing and silver for extra income. \r\n\r\nFebe has been a regular member of the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than seven years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow several times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used almost all the money she borrowed for buying ingredients for her processed food business.   Her three current businesses let her earn a profit of PHP 29,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 43,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital for her expanding business so she can buy more processed food ingredients and more clothing and silver to sell. \r\n\r\nShe dreams that she can have her own store property for her businesses and she continues to work hard so her child can have a better future.  \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":466052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buying more processed food ingredients and more clothing and silver to sell.

She is married and mother of three children whose ages vary from 4 to 15 years. She also has two sisters under her care, who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe has accumulated over 20 years experience in selling dyed pieces of cloth (thioubs). She also sells perfume and incense. She went into the retail business by passion. What interests her most in her activity is the profit-making aspect and the satisfaction of customer needs. Consequently she is borrowing 300,000 francs that will be used to purchase thioubs, so that she can complete an order received for an amount of 600,000 francs. Increasing her profits allows her to help improve the family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAlways looking to actively participate in the fight against poverty, U-IMCEC \u2013 with the positive support of lenders \u2013 succeeds in supporting communities to carry out lucrative revenue-generating activities, which in turn contributes to a welcome socio-economic development.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":464359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"increase capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-10T10:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndeye Sine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007488,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036560,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759118,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790632,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971071,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708335,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922406,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25780.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188909,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":103122.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484353,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-10T14:34:36Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167267,"name":"Bayramov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bayramov M. was born in 1956.

Babacar Sy No. 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is an association of female <i>commercantes<\/i> (vendors) working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar. The association, named after an important <i>marabout<\/i> (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a <i>tontine<\/i>, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.  \r\n\r\nToday, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC, a Kiva partner. Groups of five are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments. CurrentL., there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. Coumba Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \r\n\r\nNdeye Fatim P. heads group No. 1. She is partners with her older sister, Arame P., who is also in the group. Together, they take turns making the trip to their aunt's farm to purchase peanuts to sell in the market of Grand Thies, a neighborhood in the middle of the city. They have been in the business for some six years.

The association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.  \r\n\r\nToday, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC, a Kiva partner. Groups of five are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.  Currently, there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. CoumB. F., the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \r\n\r\nAwa N., the mother of six, is the head of group No. 2. One could say she is an international businesswoman: She travels several times per year to neighboring Mauritania to purchase shoes, fabrics and incense, bringing it back to Thies to sell door-to-door. She makes the journey most often at night, when there is less traffic. The small bus leaves Thies around 2 a.m., arriving just across the border around 8 a.m. Awa then takes the day to find the best deals, returning once again in the evening. The whole excursion typically takes about 24 hours. She says the prices in Mauritania are much lower than in Senegal.\r\n\r\nIssane F., another member of the group, agrees. She makes the same trip, often buying mobile phones, which can sell for double the price back in Thies. The other three group members are: Aissatou D., who sells guedia (dried fish); Codou Kair\u00e9, who sells fresh fish; and Awa B., whom sells monkey bread (baobab fruit), perfumes and other diverse items.  Each group member receives a 100,000 CFA franc credit to finance their activities.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":466111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Bolster each member's small business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T19:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Codou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168529,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007490,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036562,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759120,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790634,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971073,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708337,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922408,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188911,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T13:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484355,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T23:52:56Z","paid_date":"2010-11-18T13:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167273,"name":"Saida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This young lady is married and has one child.

Serigne Babacar Sy Group No. 3","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is an association of female commercantes (vendors) working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar.  The association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood.  The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.  Today, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC.  Groups of five are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount.  On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.  Currently, there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC.  Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. CoumB. Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \n\nAwa B. heads group No. 3.  She has been selling perfumes and cosmetics for about four years.   Awa chose perfume sales as they sell quite quickly - currently, the Casablanca and Aqua de Gio scents are the best sellers, she says.  Awa is married and the mother of two children, aged 2 and 6.\n\nThe other groups members are: Mareme D., who sells detergents and soaps; Gnangna D. who has a small kiosk selling small items from perfumes to candies; Maimouna F. who has a small vegetable stall in the market of Grand Thies; and Aly T. who sells marmite cooking pots in the same market.  Each group member receives 100,000 FCFA in loan financing to bolster her respective activity.  This is the second loan for the group.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":466116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","use":"To finance each member's small business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T18:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mareme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnangna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168530,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007491,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036563,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759121,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790635,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971074,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708338,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922409,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188912,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-20T11:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484356,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-16T02:45:21Z","paid_date":"2010-11-20T11:26:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167277,"name":"Proscovia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

With these loan funds he will buy green pea seeds to sow in greater quantity, and thus continue to forge ahead.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":466169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"TO BUY SEEDS IN ORDER TO PLANT IN LARGER QUANTITY","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T15:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yerson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886651,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T01:03:42Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167291,"name":"Benita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

The easiest way to come to that place is to go straight ahead on Avenida del Se\u00f1or del Pueblo. The community of Cuahuixtla, which belongs to the village bank \"La Uni\u00f3n del Progreso\", is situated right behind the Apatlaco bridge. Their members are known for the punctuality of their repayments.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the village bank are active in trade and services: Mrs Ver\u00f3nica sells protective covers for blenders and washing machines,Mrs Francisca D\u00edaz prepares pickled peppers and nopal salads,Do\u00f1a Margarita sells via catalog and also sells bu\u00f1uelos,Nohemi is a manager with the cosmetics company Mary Kay and also sells via catalog,Flor sells via catalog and some groceries when there are bargains in the store where she works,Carlos, Genoveva and Magdalena operate public transport minibuses,Sof\u00eda and Erika sell via catalog,Erick sells nutrition products from Herbalife, and finallyLeticia B. B. sells via catalog; a detailed account of her story follows.\r\n\r\nLeticia initially was a member of a loan group to which she and her mother were invited. The group was created, but had problems with the repayments. There was some fighting, but finally the loan was repaid. Leticia waited for two months and then informed the microfinance institution that she wanted to set up a new group with other members. This group was created and is now in its third loan cycle. Leticia's share of the loan amounts to 8,000 pesos, which she will invest in her store where she has a highly diversified inventory: sportswear, perfume, creams, lingerie, etc. She is married and the mother of two sons: one is in fourth grade and the other is four months old.\r\n\r\nShe told us that when she married, she suffered a lot. The reason is that she had been working since she was very young and she liked having her own money. However, when she married, everything became different, because her husband would not let her continue selling. There was a time when her husband was in the United States. She grasped the opportunity to open a store and sold anything she could. When her husband informed her that he was about to come home, she got rid of her entire inventory, so that he shouldn't notice anything. But soon he learnt the truth and had a fight with her. Finally, they talked about it and he understood that her contribution might help him to support his sons and give them everything they were entitled to.\r\n\r\nFinally Leticia thanked our microfinance institution for its support and continued lending. She was able to continue her business, because at times she did not have the necessary resources to restock her store. She used the loans to reach her goal and be able to keep selling her merchandise.

She also wishes to have enough money to buy merchandise for her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":466242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy pea seeds, fertilizer, and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T18:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886655,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T04:50:01Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167317,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A business-minded woman, Emily L., 50 years old, is a mother of three children. She is also a woman of strong faith to overcome all challenges to achieve her dreams. She is married to Eusebio L., a company driver.  She lives in Tanay, in the province of Rizal, Philippines. \r\n\r\nWith her faith to get out of poverty, in 1999 she decided to join ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), a microfinance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines, for a chance to get start-up capital for generating income. During her previous loan with ASHI, she carefully invested in the sewing business. The profit is what she uses for daily expenses and for her children's education.\r\n\r\nNow on her eighth loan, she proposes a loan of PHP 40,000.00 pesos for a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be use to purchase an overlock sewing machine (serger), a high-speed sewing machine, assorted cloth, threads and other supplies. She is very disciplined in using the money that was lent to her in her previous loans from ASHI. \r\n\r\nShe still dreams of the best for her family:  to provide the best education for her children and to have a happy family. During almost 10 years in ASHI, Emily has shown herself to be hard working and strong-minded to make her dreams come true. She hopes that her business will expand so she can save for the future. Now, she is happy seeing that the loans from ASHI change their lives and accommodate their financial means needed to support her family. She wishes ASHI and all lenders all the best and want them to keep on supporting her family and other families who want to improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":466245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To

","en":"Giachina is 28, and her family is made up of her husband and her son. They live together in a rented house. For 4 years she has been selling animals in the main livestock fairs, mostly in the weekends when she makes more sales. As well she earns other additional income on behalf of her neighbours who ask her to sell an animal.  Alongside this activity, Giachina also spends time selling food in the afternoons, and more when it is the community's celebration season and she sells tourists her vegetable soups. So it is in this way that she arranges her time to focus on her livestock and her food sales without also forgetting her home. What she likes best about her work is to continually receive income and this helps her in running her household. In the future she has plans to buy land where she can put her animals for sale, at present she houses her livestock in her mother's barn. This is her third loan with MFP, what's more she is very happy to be a member of her communal group since everyone is very supportive and meets their payments. With the loan she is asking for, she will invest in the purchase of more animals like sheep, pigs and a young bull. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":466247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy more sheep, pigs and a young bull.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T20:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giachina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886656,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T01:33:28Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167319,"name":"Qhantati Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha Q.

Through their daily work, they are reaching this goal and little by little feeling proud of their accomplishments.  They live in the city of Cuenca which is a city noted for its charming historic downtown as well as its combination of three cultures rich in symbolism, tradition and art: Ca\u00f1ari, Inca and Spanish.  Communal bank member Ana P., 20, lives in the Miraflores section of the city.  She is single and lives with her parents, helping them meet household expenses; they do not own their home, they lease.  Ana works in an Internet caf\u00e9 from 8:30am until 7pm; she has worked there for 11 months and has done well.  She also sells women's beauty products of the Yanbal brand.  She began this work again 3 months ago; she had previously sold these products to her school friends.  She tells us that she does well because her customers pay on time.  Her goal for this new year is to start her studies again.  She gets along well with all the other members of the communal bank.  She has been managing her loans with the institution for 2 years now and they have helped her to buy Yanbal products and to help with the family rent payment.  She was encouraged to join the communal bank by her mother.  The new loan will be used to buy Yanbal products such as: perfumes, chains, make-up, etc.  Her goal is to become a physician.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

His house is cement and only has running water as a basic service.  His wife is a housewife and they have two children, a 14-year-old and an 8-year old; both are enrolled in private schools near their home.  Eighteen years ago Edison began working for a sewing company and, little by little, he was able to leave the company 8 years ago with knowledge and skills that allowed him to become independent .

Presently, Tetyana has 40,000 Grivnyas worth of inventory. Her profit amounts to 3,000 Grivnyas a month. \r\n\r\nTetyana is seeking a 5,000 Grivnya loan to diversify her assorted merchandise.

Having previously owned businesses in their home country of Brazil, Elessandra heard that roofing makes good money so she thought she would give it a try.\r\n\r\nLike many startup businesses, Elessandra\u2019s encountered some challenges in terms of changes to her business. However after establishing a solid base of clients in the Brazilian community, business began to take off.\r\n\r\nWith her loan from ACCION USA, Elessandra hopes to proviD. a cash cushion for her business.

With work being slower in the winter months and some clients taking a bit longer to pay, this loan will give her the ability to keep the business running smoothly.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Elessandra hopes to continue to run a successful, profitable business here in the USA just like the businesses she and her husband started in Brazil before moving here eight years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and proviD. employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":466378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To

He believes that having his own business has helped him progress in life - there is so much that he learns from owning his own business that he applies to all aspects of his life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the success he feels from being able to provide for his family, Julio has felt a huge sense of success being able to provide a service to his community. The extra income that he earns also goes to support his aging parents back home in the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nWith the loan from ACCION USA, Julio will use 75% to buy new cell phones and accessories and 25% on promotions. He will need the extra stock in inventory to support all of the clients that will be coming through his doors.\r\n\r\nJulio is very positive about his business and believes that this loan from ACCION USA will be a big help to his success.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":465081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"To

He lives in Managua's Jonathan Gonz\u00e1lez neighborhood.  He works as a security guard in order to have a secure source of income, although it is low.  His intention has been to change jobs but this is very difficult because there are no jobs available in the country's current economic crisis; the drought that has affected the north part of the country this year has also had a negative effect on employment.  Thanks to Afodenic's loans he has managed to build his concrete house and with the previous loan he bought zinc metal sheeting, edging, sand and iron.  He also wanted to install a roof and wrought-iron grilles but he ran out of money because the prices of building materials have been rising; he also did not have enough to pay for labor costs.  This new loan, then, will be used to buy solder, iron grilles and cement in order to try to finish the construction project and begin to enjoy the improvements.  In the future, he would like to establish a small business and have better income.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

T. is 46 years old and comes from Jala-jala, in the province of Rizal, an area that is growing in terms of livelihood enterprises. She is married to Rogelio, 48 years old, a farmer and a supportive husband. She is the loving mother of four children, the oldest being 22 years old and the youngest 2 years old. Erlinda is an optimistic mother who knows she will overcome all challenges to achieve her dreams.\r\n\r\nThe income of Erlinda and her husband is not enough to cover the expense of their family. Therefore, in 1999, she got the idea of joining ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.),  a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines. Since then, she started a small farming business and it really helped them to meet their needs. She has now been in business for more than ten years. \r\n\r\nCurrently on her sixth loan, Erlinda requests Php 30,000 as additional capital for her farming business. She believes that her proposed loan will be a big help and will contribute to the growth of her business. She has disciplined herself to use all of the borrowed capital from ASHI-Kiva for her business to gain more profit and to use that profit to support the daily expenses and education of her children.\r\n\r\nErlinda has been an ASHI member for eleven years. ASHI paved the way for the achievement of the dreams of her family: to send her children to school and to have them finish their studies with a degree. In addition to this, though, she didn\u2019t stop dreaming of her children having stable and happy families in the future.\r\n\r\nErlinda is very thankful to ASHI for its kind-hearted support of her dreams. She is also hoping that, with the help of ASHI in their lives, it will do much to help them provide a sustainable life and have a comfortable house to live

She is 56 year sold and has worked for 22 years; she started as a police officer but she is now the head of the department of prison systems. Thanks to her job and her husband\u2019s help, she was able to build her own house but it still needs to be plastered and painted. Her husband died several years ago which was very sad and tragic for her.

With her husband\u2019s earnings and her own, she has saved up to now have a small shop in her home, which is run by her daughter, to cover basic costs of water, power, telephone and food. Thanks to God, she has improved her home, but the roof is in disrepair, thus she wants to fix it and add a purlin because it is very low and, furthermore, very old so that the need is urgent to repair it in the next few months so that they won\u2019t have to worry in the winter.

They all live in greater Cuenca, a city that is beautiful thanks to its architecture, the four rivers that bathe the city, and as the birthplace of great writers and artisans.  Sandra V., a member of the Las Semillitas communal bank, is 33 years old and lives in greater Cuenca.  She is married and her husband is a music teacher at a child care center, at a school, and he gives private music lessons, too.  They have three children who are 7, 6, and 4 years old.  Their two sons are students in the Liceo Decroliano.  She does not have her own house; she is a renter.  By profession, Sandra is a designer.  However, one day her eye turned inward and she lost a bit of mobility in her body.  She had some tests done and a brain tumor was detected.  She did not have surgery so is at risk but did have a magnetic resonance (MRI) done.  Now, she works for a book publisher as a spokesperson at school events but this work is sporadic and only on some days.  She wants to work independently since she used to have a shoe shop but, because she had to care for her children, she had to sell it.  She would now like to sell footwear from her house.  This is her second loan cycle with the Fundaci\u00f3n and she has told us that it was thanks to her sister that she joined.  The funds she gets from the fundaci\u00f3n will be used to buy sports and school shoes with which to start her business.  Her greatest wish is to start to produce income for her family.  Nelly V. is another member of the Las Semillitas communal bank.  She gets along well with all her fellow members and is in her second loan cycle.  She tells us that the loans have benefitted her business and it was her mother-in-law who motivated her to join the communal bank.  She has been a shoe retailer for 4 years and is doing well.  He has come to have a stand in Cuenca\u2019s free market where she sells on Wednesdays.  The rest of the week she dedicates to her family.  Nelly, 27, lives in greater Cuenca, is married, and has three small children.  Her husband is a merchant that distributes CDs throughout the city.  They do not own their home; they rent.  The requested funds will be used to buy casual and sports footwear as well as dress shoes for women, men and children to stock her business.  Her goal is to give her children the best education possible so that they will get ahead in life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva
