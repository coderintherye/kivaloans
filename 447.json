Mall U., age 40, sells chickens at a large market some considerable distance from her village. By selling at market, she is able to earn a good profit in order to help support her family. Her husband, Mr. Oll Eou (pictured here with his wife), is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice to sell for a living.

She receives orders from her neighbors and relatives, and earns between 100 and 150 PKRs for each dress she makes. This allows her to pay for her family's utility expenses.\r\n \r\nShe has applied for a loan from Asasah in order to help her husband, a private entrepreneur with a fruit-vending cart business. He visits different streets of the city with his cart, selling his wares. With this loan, he will buy seasonal fruits in bulk. Manzooran is hopeful that by adding more seasonal fruits to his cart, her husband will be able to increase his income and, as a result, improve the family's standard of living.\r\n  \r\nManzooran is in her fourth loan cycle and is a very responsible Asasah borrower.

Elkanah has been selling items such as rice, flour, oil, detergents, soft drinks, and other things to the local people for the last two years. He says that this business is profitable, and the major challenge he has is security in the area. He is using his loan of KES 20,000 to buy more general items to expand his business. He hopes to be a wholesaler in future, and also to diversify his business to include the transport industry. He describes himself as outgoing and self-reliant.

She lives in Purok Lada, Brgy. Pangbilian, Brookes Point, Palawan. \n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her vegetable and generator businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP16,000. \n\nSusan is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can purchase another electric generator to rent out. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Susan aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF:\n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Susan N. is 17 years old and lives in the town of Zanna in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.   Susan has a business of selling charcoal, which she has had for 6 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Susan has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more charcoal.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Susan hopes to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young sisters.  In the future, Susan hopes to own a house. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n             \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":585958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Zanna in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has one child.  Her child is not currently in school.  Mary has a business of food and vegetables, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mary has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more foods like cassava and 'matooke' (green plantains) for resale.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Mary hopes to generate greater profits and to buy food and medication for her family.  In the future, Mary hopes to own a house.            \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":585476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

M. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Buena Suerte, El Nido, Palawan. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a bar and restaurant located on the main street of El Nido surrounded by hotel and pension houses of the area and a very affordable restaurant in front of the El Nido Terminal.\r\n\r\nRejane joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rejane has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 which she intends to use to purchase more raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family and business.

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is having to work hard to win the hearts of customers since she is in a business which is male dominated. \r\n\r\nBilliah works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 40,000 to buy more sand, ballast and coral blocks to meet the demand of her customers. She hopes to be a supplier of her goods in future. She also hopes to own a lorry to help her transport the building materials. She describes herself as very determined. \r\n\r\nBilliah is married to a contractor and a mother of four, aged between seventeen years old and five years

With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Magdalina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future for family. Magdalina V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is single and has no children. Juliet has a pharmacy business, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Juliet has requested a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more medicine.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Juliet hopes to generate greater profits and to buy food and pay school fees.  In the future, Juliet hopes to complete university.            \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Zanna in the Kampala West region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. Esther has a business of a beauty salon, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Esther has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more braids and oil for the hair. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Esther hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food for the family and take care of herself.  In the future, Esther hopes to own a house and live a good life.         \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b> BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: wholesaling electronic reloading credits, fattening pigs and operating a tricycle transportation business. \r\n\r\nHer husband Vicente A. Jr., who is 40 years old, works as a forwarder (Margie's Door to Door Services) to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child, who is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nMary Ann joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Ann has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to pay for more load (mobile-phone credits) so that she could continue to save up for future, build her own house and widen their pig-fattening business. \r\n\r\nMary Ann A. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

N. is 16 years old and lives in the town of Zanna in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.   Betty has a business of selling shoes, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Betty has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more shoes.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Betty hopes to generate greater profits and buy food and clothes for herself.  In the future, Betty hopes to own a big shop. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":586627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

She lives in San Vicente, Brgy. Poblacion, Daanbantayan, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000. \r\n\r\nAntonietta is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Antonietta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

I. is a common law wife who lives in Prk. Lunas, Barangay Kawit, Medellin, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: General Store, Food Vending and Livestock Vending businesses. Her common law husband Serafio Mondejar, who is 53 years old, works as a electrician to earn his living.  She has six children who are between 18 and 33 years old. \r\n\r\nEsperanza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Esperanza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $360, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion. Esperanza I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Abdullojon is 45 years old and married with two children. Currently Abdullojon does not work within his profession, but tries to feed his family by trading. Abdullojon has been running his business for about fifteen years. He rents a retail store where he sells different kinds of appliances. His business is the family's main source of income. \r\n\r\nAs a rule Abdullojon travels to the neighboring town to purchase the goods he sells. Abdullojon is trying to have a wide range of goods of high quality to meet the requirements of his customers and to satisfy the needs of clients with different levels of income. Today, Abdullojon is requesting a loan of $3000. This is the 6th time that he has asked for a loan through IMON. \r\n\r\nThe loan money will be used to buy more appliances for his shop in order to increase the range of his inventory. Due to the profitability of his business, the determination of this micro-entrepreneur and his experience in the business, this customer is qualified to receive this loan. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

lives in the historic city of Lahore, Pakistan in a three-roomed house with her family. She is a 45 year old married lady who has three sons and three daughters. All of the children are getting an education, except the eldest one who left his education after 8th and started to work in an automobile workshop.\r\n\r\nShagufta herself is illiterate, but she knows the importance of education very well. She wants her children to complete their education and for that purpose, she works very hard. She makes and sells artificial flowers sets. She has business contacts with different gift shop owners and supplies them with flowers on order. She also makes decoration pieces from Plaster of Paris. She is very skillful in her art. Her husband does a private job on a monthly wage. \r\n\r\nShagufta has applied for a loan from Asasah to improve her artificial flower-making business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In order to do this she has for the past ten years been selling firewood as her main activity, but she also has a secondary activity selling fabrics, hair extensions and food. She gets her supplies at Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's large international market and also in the market at Glo, and she resells her products at home. She is requesting a first loan from ALID\u00e9 in order to achieve her goal of increasing her customer base and her working capital. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

According to him, because he has such a small shop he cannot stock many items, but if it were bigger, he would be able to bring in and sell new and different goods.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Melissa Kniazeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":586768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increasing shop size","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Absheron region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":30,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":200.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182580806,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":200.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189029,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":200.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542535,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":200.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221711055,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":200.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081420,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":200.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232843092,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":200.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238655129,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":200.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244609176,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250824198,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":200.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257234358,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-28T20:49:28Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:02:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":224298,"name":"Mwendia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwendia is a hardworking farmer from the town of Kisii in Western Kenya.

N. is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is married and has 3 children.  Two of her children are currently in school.  Lydia has a beauty salon, which she has had for 2 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Lydia has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more braids (hair extensions) and oil for the hair.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Lydia hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes pay school fees for her children.  In the future, Lydia hopes to own a house and to see her child attend university.  Lydia is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by not letting her sit at home but have something to do (become self reliant).\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":586795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

is a fruit vendor, selling jackfruits, sugarcane, mangoes, and other such fruits in Ndeeba on the outskirts of Kampala. She buys her wares from the villages of Mukono District, and she uses public transportation to and from making these purchases. Transportation is therefore somewhat of a challenge, as is seasonailty. She has been in this business for seven years and works seven days a week. She decided to join MCDT because they were offering timely loans.

N. is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is married and has 3 children.  All of her children are currently in school.  Claire runs a small eatery, which she has had for 2 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Claire has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more saucepans and stock food.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Claire hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food and school fees.  In the future, Claire hopes to own a big restaurant. Claire is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by managing to provide the home needs in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.

Moses has been operating an agro-produce sales business from Omukagyera, Ibanda for a period of 10 years. With nostalgia, this happily married father of two children recalls how his business basked in high profit returns at its onset. Times have changed, however, as the business now is in diminishing returns, earning him 150,000 Ugandan shillings in sharp contrast to previous earnings due to seasonal changes.\r\n\r\nMoses is no exception herein in terms of doing business. What he is looking forward to now is the prospect of enhancing his business by buying fertilizer and improving the production of beans and maize which he grows most.

N. is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children. Madina has a little eatery, which she has had for 6 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Madina has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more food and other stock for the eatery.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Madina hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food.  In the future, Madina hopes to complete university. Madina is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by having time to share experience with her friends at the club and enjoying reading story books rather than doing nothing. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":586811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to

is married and has two children. She first established a foodstuffs business, with a small business capital provided by her husband. She later changed to selling ready-made clothes after accumulating enough money from her first business. Ramatu has been selling ready-made clothes for the past ten years in the Silvanus market, Makeni city.  \n\nRamatu has a good credit history.

Christine, aged 39 years, a go-getter businesswoman who has been dealing in general merchandise in a retail shop. This stickler for hard work is also a married mother of 3 school-going children and has been running her business for over 2 years. With this experience behind her, she has managed to subdue most of the uncertain adversities that have threatened to play havoc with her business.

has recently decided to change her business enterprise from charcoal sales to fish vending. She has been in this new business for a few months. She works in the very market where she used to sell charcoal. She buys fish from the Gaba landing site in Makindye Division in Kampala District. Her primary business challenge is the transport of fish from Gaba to her stall in Owino market, a journey for which she presently uses public transportation. She works six days a week. She wants to use this loan to buy more baskets of fish. She aspires toward a business model of selling solely at wholesale prices. She decided to work with MCDT because she wanted to boost her business by obtaining additional capital. \r\n\r\nHawa resides in a rented two-roomed house and the family has access to electricity and piped water. Her monthly expenses include school fees, food, and rent. She is a single mother and has three children, all of whom attend school. She lives in Mengo Kisenyi in the outskirts of Kampala city. It is a walkable distance from Kampala city to her residence.

(pictured holding the sign) is the leader of this group of five borrowers. The group is called Friend Forever. \r\n\r\nTurker is 32 years old and describes himself as an earnest man. He and his wife have six children whose ages range from two to 17 years old. He also cares for one sibling. He himself was not able to attend school due to lack of financial support.

He wants to use this loan to buy wheels and to carry out a full repair of his vehicle in order to provide a good service to his customers. He is thankful for this financial institution because this was the first time he opened the doors for financing for his urban taxi service and because of it he is increasing his savings. <br

Restocking her shop with a vision of making it a wholesale business will make her earn more sales revenue and be able to pay up the education bills for her orphaned grandchildren.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":586841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"restocking with more sugar, wheat flour and maize flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-21T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kafe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaireth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Costa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2900000,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":181250},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":181250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":330.96,"local_amount":724375,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":732755.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903784,"comment":null},{"amount":248.73,"local_amount":544375,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":550672.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297257,"comment":null},{"amount":414.06,"local_amount":906250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":916734.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467531,"comment":null},{"amount":331.25,"local_amount":725000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":733387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605622,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-22T07:18:03Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":224355,"name":"Rosa Violeta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa de 55 a\u00f1os, vive en la Perimetral de Guayaquil (zona periurbana, a su alrededor tiene el estero salado),  tiene una tienda de vivieres en la parte delantera de su casa.  \n\nSu esposo le ayuda en la tienda y tienen un hijos.

She has two adult children that help her with the business.\r\n\r\nShe started out selling \u201cencebollados\u201d from a cart along Orqu\u00eddeas\u2019s streets.  (The base of this seafood soup is called \u201csofrito\u201d and is a pungent mix of tomatoes, onions, cumin, chili and cilantro.  The protein element and foundation for the stock is tuna.  The starch element is yuca a starchy root vegetable that requires time to cook down the coarse threads found within its stalk.  The result is a delicious aromatic savory and spicy soup that is traditionally topped with pickled onions and tomatoes.)\r\n\r\nGradually, with much effort, she was able to rent a locale for her business.  She is now open for business selling encebollados from 7am until 6pm every day.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy fish and onions to make more encebollados and in the future would like to have a second locale and to have permanent employees.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

There he manufactures motorcycle accessories.  He learned this trade as a young man 25 years ago working at his father\u2019s foundry.  Antonio has now been working independently in his own workshop for eight years.  By increasing this new source of income, he was able to buy his first motor and later a furnace and a bench drill.  He says he has the help of his oldest son and currently has four employees who handle the production work.  By gradually expanding the infrastructure of his business, he was able to acquire two additional motors and a forge at the market.

Another example of the growth of his business is a vending post he started six months ago, which is located on the main road in Malambo.  There he sells other motorcycle accessories such as riding jackets, helmets, ponchos, and gloves.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She started selling tortillas 5 years ago and she sells them twice a day, from 6 to 7 in the morning. Out of her three children only the two boys are in school. The girl, Xiomara, who is 17 years old, doesn't, and has been working with Gilma selling tortillas since she was very young. This is because their financial situation was desperate and Gilma had no other option than to show her daughter her skills to help them improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in the purchase of corn, wood and other products for the preparation of tortillas. With the money she will also buy her son Gerson a pair of glasses because he has sight problems. The loan will enable her to store raw materials for her tortillas and her son to see well and perform better at school; sometimes he feels sad because he can't see what's on the blackboard.

This business has allowed him to get ahead and work for the well-being of his family. Due to the continual use of this vehicle, it has had some problems which require repairs to guarantee proper functioning. In order to do this, he has decided to request his first loan, 1500 soles, from Edpyme Alternativa. Manuel is a hard-working and very responsible person. His greatest wish is to keep working to be able to offer his family the quality of life that they deserve. In the area, thanks to his work, he is very well-known and respected.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":587122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"repair costs and maintenance for his tractor to offer a ploughing service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pueblo Nuevo -

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lilia is requesting a new loan of 22,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Lilia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They have four children who are 28 to 34 years old. \r\n\r\nElsa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elsa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to purchase additional stock to sell for her general store and food vending business, so that she can continue to save up for their future and to provide her family with additional income. Elsa E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed while helping her family rise out of poverty. The financial opportunity of hog fattening is one of the best ways to help provide for her family and she very much wants to lift her family out of shortage.  Over the years she has provided for her family by being involved in hog fattening.\r\n\r\nHog fattening is a kind of business wherein, after four months of raising or fattening hogs, the hog will be sold to people in their village or in the market, either alive or slaughtered. The larger the volume of hogs being sold, the larger the profit. Therefore, Annabella can put up a savings fund for her four children whose age range is from eight to twenty years old. Through this she hopes to support their education until they graduate from college, and hopefully they will have a better life in the future.\r\n\r\nNow she is proposing a new loan of 23,000 Philippine pesos to continue supporting her hog fattening ventures. Annabella will buy additional piglets, sacks of feed, and supplements and vitamins for the pigs. She will raise them for approximately four to six months until they are ready for sale. She is hopeful that her hog fattening business will generate steady income to improve her financial stability and her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nAnnabella thanks ASHI (a KIVA partner) for providing her with the opportunity to increase her income.

J. is a widow who lives in San Roque, Ginatilan, Cebu.

With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Constancia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 12,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store and vegetable business so that she can continue to save up for the future and to provide her family with their monthly expenses. Constancia J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

D. M., 43, lives in the town of Soyapango with her life partner, who despite being retired uses his own vehicle to work as a driver, giving rides to different people.  She also lives with their two children, ages 11 and 8.\r\n\r\nSince her husband's salary is very low, Dinora decided eight years ago to open her own business, which allows her to contribute to all the household expenses along with her husband.  This is why she invested her savings in a perishable goods store, which was born from her initiative to have more economic stability.  Dinora is asking for a loan so she can invest more in her store, buying products like sausages, detergents, bread and other products.  She hopes to do this with the loan, since although she has had the shop for several years she has not had the money to invest in it because most of her earnings go toward household expenses.<br

Werner es un hombre de familia muy trabajador quien desea brindarle todo lo mejor a su hijo y esposa, por lo que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo por medio del cual pueda contar con los recursos necesarios para invertir en la tienda comprando mayor cantidad de productos de primera necesidad, sobretodo productos alimenticios, ya que cerca de su negocio se encuentra un fabrica de zapatos bastante grande de donde muchos de los empleados consumen los productos de la tienda de Werner, situaci\u00f3n la cual el desea aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo.","en":"Werner Eduardo A., 31, is a very responsible and hardworking person who works as a taxi driver at certain times or also rents the taxi out to earn more income.  He also has a perishable goods store in his home, which is located in the town of Soyapango, in the department of San Salvador, where he lives with his wife, who is a housewife, and with their one-year-old son.\r\n\r\nWerner divides the day between working in the taxi or in the store, which his wife tends when he is working outside the home.  Werner is a very hardworking family man who wants the best for his son and wife.  For this reason he is asking for a loan so he will have the necessary resources to invest in the store.  He will buy greater quantities of staple products, above all food items, since near his home there is a fairly large shoe factory where many of the employees buy products from Werner's store, and he wants to take maximum advantage of this situation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She owns a tortilla shop and eatery, where she works at preparing delicious lunches.  She does this with the aid of her mother who has been helping her for 5 years now.  She\u2019s worked hard for the well being of her family and now for the well being of her son.  Since Ana is a single mother she must work doubly hard to provide everything for her little one who has become her all.  Ana is asking for a loan to purchase corn for her tortillas so she can increase her customer base, which is already very good.  She will use the loan to purchase ingredients for both her tortillas as well as for her lunches so she may sell more and earn more profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maya Wisnievitz,
