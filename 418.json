She is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nArcily is married. To make a living, Arcily owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Arcily has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arcily joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arcily has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Arcily is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Arcily from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 34 years old. Maureen is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Maureen S. Group'.\r\n\r\nMaureen is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Maureen owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Maureen has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 1100 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maureen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maureen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Maureen is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Maureen from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":549503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

To\u00e1n is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.

To making a living, To\u00e1n operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.

She is now requesting a new loan of 5,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.

She does this work to help her husband financially. \r\n\r\nMartha is a regular client of Asasah. She has successfully completed four loans and now she has applied for a loan for the fifth time from Asasah. She will invest the loan amount in her husband\u2019s business.

B. is from the village of Katutungan, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 33 years old. Jocelyn is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Jocelyn owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. She also retails coffee and sugar. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase inventory and as working capital. Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jocelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Paul has been engaged in his business for more than eight years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Paul joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Paul has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nPaul is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Paul from PMPC.

T. is from the town of Poblacion, Kadingilan Bukidnon. She is 42 years old. Elenita is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Elenita owns & operates an appliance repair shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing repair services to local community members. Elenita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elenita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase materials needed to provide service. Elenita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase repair equipment to improve the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elenita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Maribel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maribel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maribel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Maribel is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Maribel from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Josyline began her retail shop over eight years ago in Bwambari, Rukungiri, with the sole objective of extricating her family from the harsh, narrow circumstances that they found themselves in. She was, prior to that, a married housewife who relied on handouts from her husband who, in a sense, was not doing great in his business undertakings.\r\n\r\nJosyline had to set her wits to work. This meant she had to conjure up some business of her own to help her husband to support their family of four people.\r\n\r\nWhat Josyline anticipated at the threshold of her business has not happened; she thought her chances of success were minimal.

She is 47 years of age. She is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group member if someone is delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Fely F.'s Group'. \r\n\r\nFely is married to Victor F., a carpenter and at the same time a farmer. They were blessed with 2 children; one is an adult and the other one is a teenager. Fely is engaged in operating a sari-sari (variety) store. Aside from that, the family has support from her husband from his wage as a carpenter and income from their corn production activity. Her main source of income comes from her sari-sari store business and she earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from this activity. She\u2019s been engaged in this kind of business for a year already.\r\n\r\n In April 2010, Fely joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. As a newly recognized member, she is now requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to add to her capital for her sari-sari store business. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Fely from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Kha S. is a young woman and the mother of two small children. One is enrolled in school, and the other one is not yet attending school. She distills white wine to sell. Additionally, she uses the leftovers from distilling to feed a few pigs. She has another great earner in her husband, who sells ice cream. He also buys chopped wood in bulk to resell for a profit.

This new loan will allow him to buy 20 packets of caustic soda, 17 pieces of damask, 13 bags of potash, 15 boxes of dye in different colors, etc. He gets his supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and sells to a clientele made up mostly of women who dye fabric and who are from the town of Sikasso and the surrounding area.

I. is 27 years old, single and has two children aged three years and nine months old. His business is located at Khayega, a very busy market in Kakamega. He has been supplying milk to the shopkeepers, schools and local customers. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is the large number of other people in the area doing the same kind of business as his.

One should note the the area cultivated by the group amounts to approximately 25 hectares (62 acres).\r\n\r\nThe crops are sold after harvest in Nangola and the adjoining area, and in the town of Dio\u00efla, to both men and women customers.\r\n\r\nThey hope to reach an average profit of 40,000 FCFA per campaign.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":558515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Seedlings and fertiliser, small farming equipment and labor costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Nangola","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chitan          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sadio                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayira                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":475000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":475000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":475000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":479953.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917802,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-02T19:00:09Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:56:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209762,"name":"Tsogjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsogjargal B., age 36, lives in Arhangai province in western Mongolia.

D. is from the village of Tagdo, Mambajao, Camiguin Province. He is 45 years old. Eliseo is single. To make a living, Eliseo owns & operates a business providing transportation services to local community members. Eliseo has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Eliseo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eliseo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Eliseo is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase a set of tires for his motorcycle and for the repair and maintenance of his motorcycle to continue his transport business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Eliseo from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":558533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Jackson, a happily married father of four children, ventured into a commercial tea-growing business in Kanyabuhoma, Kihihi, thirteen years ago with much vigor. This was after realizing that there is a readily available market in the area for tea leaves. Prior to that, he was into subsistence farming, mostly growing cassava.\r\n\r\nThis commercial tea growing business sees Jackson earning 60,000 Ugandan shillings on a weekly basis and this has had a great impact on his standard of living. His main disadvantage has been the low fertility of his gardens. He calculates that with his hard work nature, he would be making more money if it was not for the lack of fertilizers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, with this loan, Jackson is looking at buying fertilizers and manure and further expanding his tea plantation through buying more seedlings and doing it on a large scale. This will improve his yields and his sales and enable him to take care of his family\u2019s needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":558375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizers, manure and seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-24T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lakeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zefa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovilo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apollo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeniffer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Smith","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albiina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4100000,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025000},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025000},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1025000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":456.25,"local_amount":1025000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1028387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689399,"comment":null},{"amount":912.5,"local_amount":2050000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2056775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903548,"comment":null},{"amount":456.25,"local_amount":1025000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1028387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467296,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-25T19:00:07Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209778,"name":"Celine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celine is 38 years old and married with seven children who are between 1 and 15 years old.

They are around 40 years old with four children, and all live in the Hamdallaye quarter of S\u00e9gou, the fourth largest administrative region in Mali; they met through neighbours, family and through their business activities at the Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou market.  The group's members sell sugar, ginger juice, soap and dyed 'bazins'.  In order to increase their business funds, the members of the group have called upon the Soro Yiriwaso credit association and are on their second loan. \r\n\r\nMadame Fatoumata D. is sought-after in Hamdallaye thanks to the quality of her dyes and bazins. Her nickname in Bambara is 'Fanta Gala', which means 'Fanta the dye-expert.' \r\nShe aims to use her loan to buy 10 bazins, 300g of different colour dyes, a bag of iodised salt and 1kg of potash from the large market at Bamako. In order to dye a piece of bazin, she boils water, adds the dyes according to the required colour, then adds potash and salt. When the mixture is consistent, she immerses the piece of bazin in it for 15 minutes and then flattens it out in front of the sun in order to dry it. \r\n\r\nShe sells these dyed bazins for cash or credit, sometimes on demand, at home, at the Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou and from mobile sales around the local quarters; her customer base is made up of men and women. \r\nShe hopes to use this loan to generate an average monthly profit of 28000 FCFA which she would use to reinvest in her business, and also for savings. Her goal is to open a dyeing studio.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":558550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase white bazins and raw materials for dyeing them ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":51106.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699765,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":51106.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913679,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":51106.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180810,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":51106.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476779,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51106.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613492,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":51106.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751920,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T13:39:55Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209787,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma B. is from the village of Benhaan, Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

Mary Trailyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products for sale. Mary Trailyn is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which, once again, will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Mary Trailyn's 4th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

In the photo she is bravely raising her arm. \r\nShe is an excellent customer of the Uamsho credit association, and is a 44 year old widowed mother of three (two boys and a girl).  Her elder son is studying in his second year (bac exam year), the second pulled out of his studies, and the youngest is in the third year of primary school. Manda W. lives in the outer quarter of Majengo, a shanty town in Goma. \r\n\r\nHer husband was a victim of the 1996 war and so-called 'liberation' of the AFDL (Alliance of Democratic Force for the Liberation of the Congo), a military-political movement led by the former president Laurent D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila who overturned the dictatorial power of president Mobutu Seseseko, \r\n\r\n'Rutuku' is an alcoholic beverage made from a mixture of fermentations and manioc flour, corn, sorghum etc that are heated to over 180 degrees C, then passed through a flask connected to a chimney outlet made locally. The refined drops are then collected in a flask and cooled in order to create a strong whiskey-like taste that is appreciated greatly by her customers. \r\n\r\nManda W. began her business activity with $30 of her own money, which went towards the production and sale of doughnuts (Ndazi). Unfortunately the sales of doughnuts were not enough to pay all her family's costs, and so she diversified her business and started to sell the local drink. In addition to this, she sells Primus beer and Fanta to boost her revenue.  \r\n\r\nShe would use a loan to purchase 2 bags of sugar, 15 packs of yeast (for the production of doughnuts), one bag of corn, two bags of manioc flour, 4 heaps of firewood (for the production of the drink), etc.  She has explained that the major challenge in producing the drink is to do with credit sales. But also, sometimes if the ingredients have not been well mixed, her customers do not like the drink that is produced and refrain from buying it. \r\n\r\nShe has already bought a plot of land for her son and aims to build a house on it. She would also like her son to marry the woman with whom he has two children, in order for her dowry to be split among the family. \r\n\r\nThe Uamsho group is made up of 13 women. Manda W. is grateful to Hekima IMF for the loans that she will receive, as with these loans she will be able to see to her fatherless children's needs. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":558557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"two bags of sugar, 15 packs of yeast (for doughnuts), one bag of corn, two bags of manioc flour , four heaps of firewood (for production of the drink) etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo","town":"Goma, North Kivu province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":160,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Riziki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Furaha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kahindo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kahindo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Masika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawazo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabuo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katungu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kahambu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1601.42,"local_amount":1601.42,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-24T07:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1601.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159656121,"comment":null},{"amount":1354.11,"local_amount":1354.11,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1354.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166870548,"comment":null},{"amount":2044.47,"local_amount":2044.47,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2044.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172137036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-07T21:12:06Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209798,"name":"Zulaikho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Z.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muharam is an entrepreneur of high integrity. She is very hard working and energetic. Even when her competitors have similar product or lower prices, clients naturally gravitate to her as she can skillfully make them feel valued, respected and heard. \r\n\r\nMuharam is requesting a loan of 7,000 Somoni to purchase seasonal clothing which will help her to continue stabilizing her business and income so she can support herself and her daughter.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Faridah\u2019s business serves the local community by providing a good selection of food to the people in her village.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Faridah is requesting a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used for buying more stock of goods to sell in her grocery.  Faridah hopes to expand her grocery business and sell more types of goods, in order to gain more profit and support her young family.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \r\n\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":558587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Munira is a mother of 4 children. She is a very honorable and resolute woman. Ever since she was a young girl, she learned the honest work of raising cattle, the knowledge she has passed down to her own children who have also managed to improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nMunira and her husband started their livestock business with only one cow. After a number of sacrifices they were able to increase little by little the quantity of calves. At the moment, with the support of their children, they have started to produce milk. They sell it on the weekends in their village. \r\n\r\nCurrently Munira wants to expand her business and to purchase more cattle. With the desire of improving their living conditions, Munira is counting on your generous heart. \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \n\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

Juliet is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kalisizo in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has 3 children.  Two of her children are in school, and she also takes care of an additional dependent who is an orphan. Juliet has a business selling mats and other crafts, which she has had for several years.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Juliet is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used for buying more craft materials and other supplies for her to make her mats and other crafts.  Juliet hopes to have a more successful business and generate profit in order to support her children and the orphan she takes care of in their schooling.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \r\n\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to  purchase additional products to sell. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Imelda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her child. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is married and is the father of 2 children, who are 3 and 6 years old.  The oldest goes to school.  Gilberto only studied through the 8th grade; he didn't continue due to a lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and supports his mother and brother, who both live with him.  \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane for Boane with his mother after his father went to work in that district.  He has been the owner of his own business for more than 6 years.  He does not have any employees and earns about 4,500 MZN per month, which he uses to pay for household expenses.  He is even able to save some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nGilberto never has had loans with other banks.  He found out about Hluvuku through institution officials who were conducting enrollment campaigns.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy supplies (cooking oil, rice, sugar, etc.) in order to build up his business's merchandise.  He promises to pay back the loan on time so that he will be able to ask for others.  In the future, he intends to ask for more loans in order to improve his family's living conditions and to start raising cattle and goats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \r\n\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

is 36 years old. She is a widowed mother of 4 children ages, 8, 12, 15, and 20. All the children are currently attending school. She is a farmer from Kisii town in Western Kenya. She has been farming for over 15 years and has employed two casual labourers. Her products are tea, cabbages, bananas, finger millet, and beans which she sells at the local market. She also earns income from her rental houses in the same area.\n\nKerubo's biggest challenge in farming is the poor transport network which makes it difficult to deliver products to the market and lack of enough skills in dairy farming.\n\nKerubo recently completed a previous loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 30,000 KES and has requested this loan of 45,000KES to purchase a water tank to harvest rain water for her dairy animals. This water tank will enable them to save a lot of time spent on fetching water from the river.\n\nIn future, she would like to own at least 3 quality dairy cows. She is grateful to Juhudi for the financial

She is married and has 6 children, who are between 11 and 26 years old.  All of them go to school.  Fauza only completed elementary school; she did not continue due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own house with her family and supports 3 nieces and nephews who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Maputo for Boane when she became widowed after the death of her first husband.  She has had her own business selling bundles of tobacco for more than 25 years.  She does not have any employees and earns about 12,000 MZN each month, which she uses to pay for expenses.  She is even able to save some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nFauza never has had loans with other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 3rd loan, which has a value of 20,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy products (sacks of tobacco) to increase her stock.  The previous loans were for 12,000 MZN and 15,000 MZN, both for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back the loan on time so that she will be able to have access to others.  In the future, she intends to request more loans to help improve her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

is 40 years old. She is married with 4 children who are all adults now. She is a farmer from Nyamira town in Western Kenya where she has been farming for 20 years. She has employed  one person from her community to help with the farm work. Her products are maize, milk, and tea which she sells at the local market. Her major challenge has been the limited availability of animal feed due to dry seasons and also, animal diseases.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 60,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow.

All of the members are from the Barrio D. Enace Vista Alegre.  Many of them know each other, and some are even neighbors.  Rosa has been the president of Banco Comunal since its formation, and her cheerfulness and responsibility have led the members to consistently re-elect her as the bank's leader.  Rosa is married and has five children (of whom four are students).  Rosa is a nurse by profession, but she left that work in order to look after her children.  Now Rosa sells firewood from her home, as well as other products that she gets from suppliers.  Her children help her to carry out this work.  In addition to her sales, Rosa also at times will travel to the different regional fairs where she purchases grain products that can be later processed in a rented mill, and sold to vendors from varous local markets.  \r\nRosa requests a loan of 300 soles, which will be invested in the purchase of wheat and barley.  During the time in which she was a member of Finca Per\u00fa, she learned to save money and be responsible.  What she most enjoys about working with a communal bank are the meetings, where she gets to see the other members with whom she is freinds.  Her dream is to grow her business and for her children to complete their education.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3750,"image":{"id":558747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Para la compra de trigo, cebada.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-06-22T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salustia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayde Noymi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10550,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1758.3},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1758.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1758.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1758.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1758.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1758.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":624.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":624.99,"local_amount":1758.3,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159630026,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":1758.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844072,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":1758.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110250,"comment":null},{"amount":625.01,"local_amount":1758.34,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177403480,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":1758.34,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-27T10:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542032,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":1758.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188678843,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-30T17:19:05Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:03:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209897,"name":"Segundo Anastacio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Segundo es casado con 2 hijos, vive con su esposa y sus hijos en la ciudad de San Ignacio, en el centro de la ciudad cuenta con un copet\u00edn y hamburgueser\u00eda donde todos los d\u00edas trabaja con su se\u00f1ora y sus hijos.\nEl solicita un  cr\u00e9dito para adquirir m\u00e1s mercader\u00edas como carne, panificados, mayonesas, condimentos, y otros con el fin ampliar la disponibilidad de comidas r\u00e1pidas en su local.\nEl Cliente manifiesta su satisfacci\u00f3n por el trabajo que est\u00e1 realizando ya que mediante ingreso \u00e9l puede mantener a su familia. \n\n","en":"Segundo is married with 2 children, and lives with them and his wife in the city of San Ignacio.

Every Wednesday she travels to the rural communities in the area and buys poultry (ducks, turkeys) that she then resells to the meat sellers in the city market. She butchers the animals herself and sells them ready for resale. This business is her main source of income.\r\n\r\nAnother business is making and selling wine.

With this loan, she is keen on purchasing more retail items such as rice, sugar, salt and soap.\r\n\r\nMerab is the lady with a green veil wrapped around her head and she belongs to a group of other members who insure and hold each other accountable in paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":558715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase retail items such as sugar and soap","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mubende","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.5 31.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-24T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anakireti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enock ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorothy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kerren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bruhan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Slyvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6500000,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1634150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689403,"comment":null},{"amount":725,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1634150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903552,"comment":null},{"amount":725,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1634150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297025,"comment":null},{"amount":725,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1634150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467300,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-29T14:20:30Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209907,"name":"Kayi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kayi E. works in her home town of Lom\u00e9.

She does not have any employees and earns about 3,500 MZN per month, which she uses to pay for expenses.  She is even able to save some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nSabata has had loans with other banks, but she later decided not to continue on with them.  She found out about Hluvuku through her neighbor, who has already received a loan through this institution.  This is her 4th loan, which has a value of 20,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy construction material (sand, cement, stone, iron, etc.) to expand and improve her home.  The previous loans were for 2,700 MZN, 6,000 MZN, and 15,000 MZN, which she put toward her business and her house.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back the loan on time so that she can receive others.

P. logro reunir un dinero para emprender  el negocio  de  fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles de madera, Muebles J. y A. que hoy es apoyado por la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, desde hace mas de 3 a\u00f1os, organizaci\u00f3n  a la que hoy solicita un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $2.000.000 COP, para comprar materias primas como l\u00e1minas de madera MDF prensada, para fabricar multimuebles encargados y pagar la mano de obra. \nAl principio Ivon cuenta, que se dedic\u00f3  solo a la comercializaci\u00f3n de multimuebles y otros productos en madera y que poco a poco su rentabilidad la hizo pensar en una mejor alternativa como hoy lo hace, pues ella  dise\u00f1a el mueble requerido, compra la materia prima, las lleva a talleres donde  paga   la mano de obra, entreg\u00e1ndoles un anticipo de dinero, para que  inicien la producci\u00f3n  y cuando el producto est\u00e1 ya elaborado,  ella paga el saldo pendiente. De esta manera comercializa su producto terminado con clientes que ella consigue directamente, a trav\u00e9s de su esposo o por referidos. Antes de entrar a la Fundaci\u00f3n ella tenia problemas de liquidez que gradualmente ha superado y   porque su capital se encontraba en las cuentas por cobrar de los clientes, estaba en ese entonces su negocio estancado, pero con los cr\u00e9ditos pudo despegar, as\u00ed fue como al   recibir su segundo financiamiento,  logro activar su comercializaci\u00f3n y consigui\u00f3 nuevas posibilidades de inversi\u00f3n. En la actualidad rota sus cuentas por cobrar entre 12 y 30 meses y su c\u00f3nyuge se dedica por completo a la administraci\u00f3n del negocio, mientras ella como es educadora lo apoya parte del tiempo en ello.\nA nivel familiar su meta principal es  continuar apoyado la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y abrir un punto de venta para ser atendido tambi\u00e9n por su esposo. Su desaf\u00edo  mas importante  se presenta,   cuando da largos plazos a los pagos de  sus clientes  y se han presentado algunos problemas  en su recuperaci\u00f3n pero se asegura de recupera por o menos la inversi\u00f3n.\nIvon su c\u00f3nyuge y su familia son personas muy felices ; su negocio esta ubicado en el centro del municipio de  Malambo a dos calles del parque de la cultura;   donde es muy com\u00fan utilizar el sistema de cr\u00e9dito puerta a puerta como ellos lo hacen.\n\n","en":"In her work as a teacher of biology and chemistry, and with help from her husband, Ivon C. P., an independent accountant, she has gotten together enough money to set up a business making wood furniture, Muebles J. y A.  The Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has helped the business for over three years.  \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n for $2,000,000 COP.  The loan is to buy raw materials like medium density fiber boards to make ordered modular furniture and to pay for the labor.\r\n\r\nIvon says that at first she only worked at selling the modular furniture and other wood products.  Little by little its profitability made her think of a better alternative.  Now she designs the requested furniture.  She buys the raw material and takes it to shops where she pays for the labor.  She gives them a down payment so that they start the work.  When the product is done, she pays the remaining balance.\r\n\r\nThis way she sells her final product to customers she gets directly from her husband or from referrals. \r\n\r\nBefore working with the Fundaci\u00f3n, she had liquidity problems which she has gradually overcome.  She also encountered problems with the customers\u2019 bills.  At that time her business was stalled.  But, with the loans she was able to take off.  \r\n\r\nUpon receiving her second loan, her sales were stimulated, and she got new investment possibilities.  She rotates her accounts charging between 12 and 30 months.  Her husband devotes himself completely to the administration of the business.  Meanwhile, as a teacher, she helps him with the business part of the time.\r\n\r\nOn the family level, her goal is to continue supporting her children\u2019s education, and to open a spot where her husband can sell also.  Her most important challenge is when she gives customers a long time to pay.

Although she makes clothing now, she first started in business selling beauty products, pursuing her dream of independence. Eventually, by making the most of a little she inherited from her family, Mar\u00eda set up her tailoring business. She makes men's trousers, girls' dresses, bed covers - and other garments, whatever is fashionable and whatever her customers request.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's secoond loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has develeoped a good relationship with this organisation because they financed her loan at an affordable interest rate and on a fair payment plan. She is seeking the loan of $1025 to buy fabric and have her sewing machines overhauled and repaired. Ultimately Mar\u00eda aims to buy a more advanced sewing machine so that she can take on bigger projects, but she will wait as this would be too large an investment at present. For now her goal is to involve her daughter in the business and take on more work.

Together they live in the town of Quimbiri, situated in the beautiful rainforest of Peru, where they rent their house. \r\n\r\nNancy has a cafe bar that is aimed at customers over 18 years old. Her business is giving her good economic returns. The key factor of its success lies in the good service and attention that Nancy provides her customers, offering traditional drinks and tropical drinks, in order to satisfy her clientele. Her spouse helps with the business. In addition she relies on the service of two women who help her attend to customers. Her business hours are from 10:00 AM until 3:00 AM and her store location is right in her town. \r\n\r\nWith the savings earned over four years, Nancy was able to buy a plot of land with the intention of owning her own home. Her future plans are to open a store where she will offer typical regional food in order to diversify her clientele. This is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, which she commits to repay timely. She has confidence that she will go far with her community group, since it offers many benefits. With the loan she requests, she will set up her bar, buying tables, chairs, and regional crafts to decorate the walls, with the intention of entertaining new customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Samantha Cerone, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":558908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tourism","sector":"Services","use":"To buy tables, chairs, artisan decorations for business in tourism","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":328.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":344.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":353.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":368.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":379.77},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":395.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":409.03},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":421.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.28},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.64},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.08},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.84,"local_amount":328.86,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":333.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673491,"comment":null},{"amount":123.28,"local_amount":344.04,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":348.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887310,"comment":null},{"amount":126.64,"local_amount":353.41,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":357.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154321,"comment":null},{"amount":132.11,"local_amount":368.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":373.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449619,"comment":null},{"amount":136.08,"local_amount":379.77,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":384.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588319,"comment":null},{"amount":175.14,"local_amount":488.77,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":494.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724821,"comment":null},{"amount":113,"local_amount":315.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":319.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463009,"comment":null},{"amount":150.91,"local_amount":421.14,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":426.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886521,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-13T17:20:34Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209959,"name":"Laura Lizethe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Laura Lizethe es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora, desde hace un a\u00f1o se dedica a la venta de ropa usada y nueva, este negocio es para apoyar a su esposo; con los gastos familiares como de educaci\u00f3n ya que aun ellos siguen estudiando  para estar mejor preparados acad\u00e9micamente.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. Juliet is now requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to add to her capital for purchasing good lumber and to buy another bandsaw mill machine. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and as savings for her children\u2019s future education.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She lives in the Department of Ahuachap\u00e1n along with her husband, a math teacher, and her two children ages 16 and 14.  Judith is someone who loves to work for the well-being of her family since, despite having to put forth a great effort, it is worth it to see her family living a stable and happy life.\r\n\r\nShe works as a merchant, offering different types of beauty products such as creams, makeup, perfumes, and other items.  She also sells jewelry, which she offers door-to-door to neighbors and friends.  Her sales are stable, and she would like to augment her inventory to grow her business as she currently has very few products.\r\n\r\nJudith requests a loan in order to buy a larger quantity of cosmetics and jewelry.  She needs to be able to rely on the loan made by Integral because her sales are done on a credit basis.  For this reason, she does not always have the necessary capital to buy all the goods she requires.  Judith wishes to improve her business and, in this manner, grow as a merchant.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

Because of this, a lot of people go by, which benefits Francisco, since many people stop and buy his products. He sells a lot of product in units, but mostly he sells wholesale and his customers distribute to other businesses. Francisco is asking for a loan to diversify his business even more, buying onions, cabbage, tomatoes and potatoes wholesale. These are the vegetables that have the highest demand.

The official name of this borrowing group is 02.06.10 Thieu Hoa (02.06.10 Thieu Hoa).\r\n\r\nSon is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Son raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising cattle for sale. Son has been engaged in this business for more than 30 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 Vietnamese Dong (VND) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Son joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Son has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.280.000 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND, which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. It will be the ninth loan Son has taken from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.
