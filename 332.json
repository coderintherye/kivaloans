He transports baggage and luggage to and from the countryside to the center of the province. Besides transportation he also sells coal and firewood by using his truck. Badamsuren started his business in 2006 after buying a big truck of his own. He has found success with his business over the years and has built a reputation as a good and honest driver. Badamsuren is focused on continuing to improve his business and provide a good life for his family. He hopes to use his earnings to buy a new truck in the near future.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Although they try to work hard, they still do not earn enough income to support the family, so Mrs. C. Vanna decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice to keep in stock to resell at a better price. Mrs. C. Vanna is a mother of five children, one of whom is a garment worker, while three of the others are attending the local school and the youngest one, at the age of five, is too young to work or study.

Djamela is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. \r\n\r\nDjamela is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of 5,000 Somoni to increase the inventory she has for sale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At first she had only a manual oven to make her products but, after several years of steady earnings, she was able to purchase a more efficient modern oven last year. Her success has also enabled her to hire seven more assistants at her bakery booth. Chuluuntsetseg is working hard to continue her success in the future. She hopes to soon purchase more tools and supplies to help her business and says, \"My goal is to one day own my own workplace.\" She is requesting a 2,000,000-tugrug loan to purchase tools and flour

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The shop is open from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. daily. He makes about 20,000 Tanzanian shillings a day, which is about US$15, giving him a monthly profit of about US$450. He plans to use this loan to buy school books for children, which are commonly sold in stationery shops like his along with notebooks, greeting cards, paper, pens, and sometimes even candies.\r\nThis is Bakari's first loan from a microfinance institution! He is grateful for your support. In the photo, Bakari is the first on the left, wearing a red shirt. He is pictured with the other members of his loan group, which named itself Khanga. The group members will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan. This loan is what Tujijenge calls a \"Motisha Loan.\" It is for borrowers who have excellent repayment histories and wish to take out a larger loan than the original amount before their first loan term has ended.

Virgincita B., 44 years of age, is married and is a resident of Sumirap, Tangub City. They are blessed with nine children of whom four are still studying and the rest are now working. Her husband is doing manual labor jobs and at the same time is engaged in farming. With this situation, it has been so hard for her to raise their big family. She decided to engage in fish selling and was able to sustain this business for three years, even in times of hardships. She joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) a year ago because she is very much interested in PMPC's various products and services. Having successfully repaid two previous loans, she was able to borrow an amount of 7,000 Philippine pesos for her third loan to obtain needed capital for her business. Her dream in life is to be able to send all her children to college so that they will have a better future and be able to improve their living

Barnidas is a 65-year-old mother of eight children whose ages range from 23 to 44 years-old. Through her hard work and determination in running a business to help her husband support the education of their children until they graduated from college, all the children are now professionals. However, Erlinda is not free of her financial obligations to her children because they have their own families to take care of.  Therefore, she joined Kiva partner ASHI to have access to credit which she will use to grow a business which she has been nurturing for a long time. With the help of her farmer husband, Erlinda plans to purchase additional cattle which she will raise with her existing cattle in her selling and breeding business. Through ASHI she is requesting a loan and Erlinda has the courage to invest the loan in her business because she has much experience in this field. She knows that once the cattle are sold, profits can as much as double from the initial investment.  She negotiates, supported by her husband, with potential buyers in different municipalities during market days. On these days, people from different municipalities also come to buy other commodities being sold. \r\n<p>\r\nErlinda\u2019s intention of making her business successful is not only for herself but for her grandchildren as well. She wants to make her grandchildren happy by supporting their financial needs if their parents have problems to do so.

Despite poverty, she has been able to raise her six children, whose ages are now from five to 20 years old. Her husband is very supportive and loving towards her and that is why she became so eager to work harder to achieve her dreams for her children and for changing her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nWhen she became a member of ASHI, she started her own business of doing manicures and pedicures to help her husband with another source of income. All throughout the loans she received from ASHI since she became a member, there was never a time that she had a problem in repayment because she knows how to budget her finances for the business and family.\r\n\r\nDuring harvest, some of the profit from her rice selling was saved and some was reinvested in the business along with the loan she requested to grow her business further. Her daily income out of her manicure\/pedicure business is used to pay her weekly amortization in ASHI. Most of the time her profits are less than the expenses, so the loans Rosalinda takes from ASHI are a great source to reinforce her capital.\r\n\r\nNow that Rosalinda\u2019s children are at a higher education level, they need a larger amount of money for their educational expenses. Therefore, with her and her husband\u2019s broad experience in running their rice planting business, she would like to grow it further.  However, she needed a larger amount of capital. To address her problem, she would like to request a loan from ASHI. Rosalinda also hopes that she will have a good harvest and favorable profits so her younger children can graduate from college, unlike her eldest who is now 20 years old."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":460795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

C. lives in the biggest Barangay (village) of San Jose De Buenavista, province of Antique. The most common livelihood of people in their Barangay is agriculture. Some are into rice planting businesses while others have livestock raising businesses.\r\n\r\nWith Vanjie\u2019s previous loan requested through ASHI, she has been able to start raising cattle and supporting her rice planting business. These are raised just in her wide backyard where the land is covered with green grass and surrounded with rice plants. Once her cattle have been given a period of time to grow, they will be sold and the profit will be as much as double the capital (the same as the rice).\r\n\r\nHowever, incomes in these kinds of businesses are seasonal, as well as the income of her husband, who is a farmer also. That is why Luzviminda thought of the need to have more savings so that she can provide her family with their daily needs. \r\n\r\nThrough ASHI and its partnership with Kiva, Luzviminda would like to request a much larger loan amount to grow her business and to be able to have more profits as well as savings. For her business to be the greatest provider of money for her family, she needs to invest more capital in it.  She hoped that her savings would someday be enough to support the education of her three children, whose ages range from 10 to 19 years old.\r\n\r\nHer eldest child, who no longer goes to school, is working as a cook in one of the fast food restaurants in town. His income is too small to be able to help his

is 40 years old. She is married and the mother of two children who go to school. She lives at Axim in the western region of Ghana. \r\n<p>\r\nAxim is in the coastal area, and the major occupation for most women there is fish mongering and selling.  Comfort takes a supply of fish from the seashore and smokes them. She has customers who come to buy them in bulk to re-sell to the final consumers. \r\n<p>\r\nComfort also prepares and serves her customers with very tasty and good quality fish, and because of that many customers buy from her stand.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been a member of the savings bank in Ouakam which belongs to the IMCEC mutual savings and credit union (U-IMCEC) since 2008 and has had one previous loan. She is a married woman with two children. She has a diversified activity. She is developing a commercial business selling various products as well a poultry farming business. She has ten years of experience in her activities. She is asking for a loan of 300,000 francs with which she intends to buy toys, sheets, nappies, shoes, bags, hair weaves (\"greffages\") and clothes that she will sell in her shop, which lies opposite the market in Ouakam. Her goods are often adapted to the needs of her clients depending on the occasion. What interests her most in her business is the contact with her customers and the fact that she gets to attend to them. This loan will allow her to expand the range of products she can offer to her customers with a view to satisfying their needs. The resulting increase in her profits will allow her to invest more in the poultry farming business. \r\n\r\nIn line with its ongoing vision to participate actively in the battle against poverty, U-IMCEC, with the backing of its lenders, is successfully providing support for people to carry out lucrative income-generating activites; this in turn contributes to a welcome socio-economic

She lives in a rented room with her mother, Juana, 52, and her little daughter.  She is willing to work very hard to provide them with a good quality of life.  She sells original dresses to her clients at her clothing store in the center of the city. Her dresses are in high demand by the young ladies, especially for their proms.  Clorinda sews the dresses herself because she wants to sell original designs.  What she likes best about her work is advising her clients; she always tells them which dress looks best on them or which color works best with their skin tone.  She's been doing this for three years, and the hardest part for her is having to remain at the store for long periods of time without being able to leave.  In the future she'd like to open a more diversified store where she can sell casual clothing as well as dresses.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Clorinda's first loan with MFP, and even at her young age she knows she has to pay it back without missing any payments.  She is well-loved at her village bank because she is the youngest and most cheerful.  She plans to use the thousand soles she is requesting to buy new materials to make more dresses so she can offer her clientele more variety.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske,

His shop is located on a portion of his land because there isn't a better place available for him to work quietly.  In addition to his workshop, Adolfo had the opportunity to purchase a moto-taxi for himself, and during his free time he either transports passengers with it or rents it to other taxi drivers who are without access to a moto-taxi.  When he rents his moto-taxi, his earnings also increase at the mechanic's shop because he has more time to simply interact with his clients and thus create permanent clients who return to him time after time.  Currently, he is hoping to find a different plot of land where he can build his workshop, in order to have it in a more convenient location.  This is Adolfo's fourth loan with Micro-Finanzas Prisma, and he is very reliable when it comes to his loan repayments.

To earn a living and help with family expenses, Patricia works selling perfumes, cosmetics, and jewelry. She sells the most recognized beauty products as these are in high demand in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nPatricia has operated this business for three years. She offers credit to her clients, leaving the product and collecting later, either daily, biweekly, or monthly, according to the client\u2019s ability to pay. For her, the most rewarding part of her work is looking for new ways to communicate with the clients. It is very advantageous for obtaining good clients and repeat business. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Patricia sells citrus juices, made with local fruit such as the camu camu, cocona, and aguaje among others. She started this business three months ago as a means of increasing income. In the future, her desire is to have a store selling clothing and shoes. \r\n\r\nThis is Patricia\u2019s fifth loan with MFP and she promises to be punctual in her payments.

She lives about 15 minutes outside the city of Cuenca in the Narancay Bajo region.  She gets along well with all of her friends in the communal bank.  She is 27, married, and has three children.  They are 12, 7, and 6 years old.  They all go to the Agust\u00edn Cuesta Vintimilla School.  Her husband is a bricklayer, a profession that allows him to support the household.

She has been working in this business for 15 years.  It is going well for her, but she also has her bad days.  Her work schedule is from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m.  This is her fourth cycle of working with loans that the foundation has given her.  They have helped her to continue buying products for her business.  She comments that it was a friend who motivated her to become a member of her bank.  She will use the new loan from the Espoir Foundation to buy more grains like kidney beans, ears of corn, and peas, etc.  She will also buy fruits like oranges, pineapples, and all types of seasonal fruit.  She will do this to keep growing in her business.  Her greatest dream in life is to have a large fruit and grain establishment.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Her 20-year-old son is married, but the couple still lives in the family home, sharing the household expenses. Her 17-year-old son works and helps her a little bit economically; her 15- and 13-year-old children are in secondary school; her 10-year-old is at the community elementary school, and her 5-year-old attends preschool.

She has been working in this business for 4 years, and she reports that it is going well for her. The shop where she works is rented, and she works from Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. This is her first loan with the Foundation; she was inspired to join by the loan promoters who came to her village to teach people about the Foundation's benefits. With the loan she receives from the ESPOIR Foundation, she will invest in her business by purchasing additional products for her snack bar, such as lollipops, bags of chips, soft drinks, bottled water, etc. Her goal is to get ahead and to continue to expand her business. \r\n\r\nRosa S. lives in the community of Taguan and is 39 years old.

This is her first loan with the Foundation, and she hopes to continue expanding her work and helping her family get ahead.

Pablo attends to a kiosk in a private school in the city.  He started this business 2 years ago with a small amount of his own savings, and little by little the business has grown.  With the income it generates, Pablo has funded the education of his children, the last of whom recently entered the university.  He attends to the kiosk in a warm and friendly manner, since his main contact is with children.  His younger daughter helps him attend to the kiosk.  He saves the maximum amount of money that he can from the sales of the kiosk in order to reinvest in the business.  Pablo's dream for the future is to have a better income, and in this way be able to provide a good education for his youngest daughter.  He requests this loan in order to make improvements to his home, which was affected by the earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

He has a carpentry workshop located in his house, where he makes doors, chairs, dining room sets, etc. Don Octavio began his business 28 years ago. It is worth noting that he has worked at this activity since his childhood, since his father was a carpenter and it was from his father that he learned the trade. When he began, he had only a circular saw and a lathe, and with time he began to amass his capital to buy wood as well as his other items. The loan will be invested in the purchase of raw materials to fill promised orders that are now waiting. His dream is to establish a larger workshop and exhibit articles for sale, without needing to produce only for orders.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":461475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Octavio Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.59,"local_amount":1831.9,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1908.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118076156,"comment":null},{"amount":33.41,"local_amount":668.09,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:09Z","rounded_local_amount":696.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493447,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":868.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676285,"comment":null},{"amount":157.24,"local_amount":3144.84,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3276.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710652,"comment":null},{"amount":30.9,"local_amount":618.09,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":643.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045935,"comment":null},{"amount":47.11,"local_amount":942.27,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":981.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761151,"comment":null},{"amount":27.84,"local_amount":556.76,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":580.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848140,"comment":null},{"amount":28.5,"local_amount":569.94,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":593.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256126,"comment":null},{"amount":41.74,"local_amount":834.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":869.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802154,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T17:11:14Z","paid_date":"2010-11-18T11:10:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166226,"name":"Rosa Adela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa esta solicito un cr\u00e9dito  dice que los pr\u00e9stamos han influido favorablemente en su vida, ya que le ha ayudado a generar ganancias que le ayudan a suplir las necesidades familiares.

Bernarda claims that this business has helped her to have a good income, and it has allowed her to continue to support her two minor children.  She is thankful to the Foundation Le\u00f3n 2000, since through their loan she increased her inventory, increased her sales and in the end improved her living conditions; she was even able to carry out some improvements to her home.  She dreams that in the future she can set up a small grocery store in her home, and above all she hopes that her children can study at the university.  Elsa sells nactatamales, tortillas and beans; in addition she sells firewood from her home.  Both women are requesting financing to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":461488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernanrda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.53,"local_amount":1250.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1303.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118076158,"comment":null},{"amount":62.47,"local_amount":1249.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123912164,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493448,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676287,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710654,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045937,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761153,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848142,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T21:26:57Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166230,"name":"Mana Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Mana est\u00e1 integrado por cuatro mujeres trabajadoras y muy competentes que desde muy tempranas horas est\u00e1n realizando sus labores.

Such is the case of Ang\u00e9lica C. and Nora C..\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica: I am 41 years old and have two children, one of whom is grown up and the other is 14. I started working in a small business when I was a young girl. At the beginning I did it to help a friend who was selling beauty products. I sold them to my friends and acquaintances, and in exchange she gave me small gifts. A few years later I decided to take a beauty consultant\u2019s course. I realised that it could be a profitable venture. Also working in my own business allows me to care for my son.  I also decided to sell private school uniforms and invested the profits from this business in merchandise with the goal of increasing my income later on. And so it happened that I earned more and used the money to educate my children. The youngest is in a private school. I help my husband pay for the family\u2019s expenses. I need the loan to buy swimsuits as the summer season is approaching.\r\n\r\nNora: I am 56 years old, and before my husband died I spent my time bringing up my family as he did not like the idea of my working. I started to feel that sadness and depression were destroying me emotionally, so I decided that I would use my time working in my own business, something I had always wanted to do.

We take this opportunity to know a few of the members a little bit better.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda is 50 years old and has been selling beauty products for more than eight years.  A friend convinced her to work after she separated from her husband when her children were 15 and 12 years of age.  At the time, Yolanda was working as an assistant at a state school.  She offers her products with great enthusiasm to acquaintances, friends, teachers, and parents at the school.  Over time she decided to sign up to proviD. cosmetics from various lines (Esika, Avon, and Natura) and become a beauty consultant.  Her business is profitable because the only capital required is the money needed to purchase merchandise for her inventory.  Yolanda\u2019s hard work and desire to succeed have enabled her to fulfill her duty as a mother to proviD. food, clothing, and an education for her son who is studying electrical engineering.  Her ex-husband no longer provides financial support.  Her business went through some ups and downs as a result of paying for medical expenses and treatment when her son became ill.  He recovered quickly and afterwards she was able to buy a small refrigerator for her home.  She is requesting a loan to purchase cosmetics.  She hopes to have a house of her own sometime later because she has been a caretaker at a children\u2019s home for the past nine years.  \r\n<p>\r\nAng\u00e9lica is 39 years old.  She began working nine years ago by selling candy out of a cart that she parked outsiD. of the state schools.  On the weekends, she carried a basket of candy to sell at parks, stadiums, and patron saint festivals in the district of Chosica.  She normally sells in the afternoons and evenings because she spends her mornings performing her household chores.  The loans she has received have been used to purchase merchandise (peanuts, beans, popcorn, soft drinks, cookies, snacks, and candy).  In addition she crochets and knits items such as baby outfits, jackets, sweaters, caps, and ponchos. Ang\u00e9lica also does appliqu\u00e9s with beads, tassels, shells, strips of wood, or whatever material is in fashion and requested by her customers.  She currently has outstanding orders for dresses and jackets, so she needs a loan to purchase crochet needles and colored wool.  Her earnings will enable to help her husband with paying for food, clothing, and education for their children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":461636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fiorella De Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evila Teodocia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9950,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2487.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":862.67,"local_amount":2488,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2493.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064632,"comment":null},{"amount":862.33,"local_amount":2487,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899691,"comment":null},{"amount":862.67,"local_amount":2488,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2493.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933774,"comment":null},{"amount":862.33,"local_amount":2487,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661367,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:21:39Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166257,"name":"Los Tunales Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Llamada as\u00ed esta alcanc\u00eda comunal por el cultivo D. tuna en la zona llamado San Bartolom\u00e9 y TornaM. es all\u00ed donD. se extrae adem\u00e1s la cochinilla que es empleado para la coloraci\u00f3n D. prendas textiles, sus doce integrantes son personas responsables, microempresarias quienes se dedican en vender frutas, golosinas, comida.\n\nYanet es madre soltera y tiene 48 a\u00f1os D. edad, la necesidad D. criar a sus hijos la impuls\u00f3 a vender frutas en su casa que est\u00e1 ubicada en la carretera central, levant\u00e1ndose muy temprano para comprar la mercader\u00eda en el mercado mayorista D. frutas, aprovecha expender tuna, melocotones, manzana y mandarinas a los \u00f3mnibus, camiones y autos que visitan la sierra central; tambi\u00e9n venD. gasolina y petr\u00f3leo a los autos que circulan en la zona.

The need to support her children prompted her to sell fruit from her home, which is located along the main highway.  She wakes up early to buy her merchandise in bulk at the wholesale fruit market.  She offers prickly pears, peaches, apples, and tangerines to people who are traveling to the mountains by bus, truck, or car.  Yanet also sells gasoline and oil for cars that pass through the area.  In addition, in the mornings, she is in charge of maintaining the water pipes for her community.  Her first loan was used to purchase sodas, pound cakes, and cookies.  She used her earnings to buy a display case for storing candy, a refrigerator, and supplies for her business.  The group photograph was taken at Yanet\u2019s business, so we can see that she has been improving over time.  Yanet has been able to pay for her family\u2019s expenses and help one of her daughters earn her pharmacy degree.  She is currently supporting her youngest daughter who is studying information technology, paying for her own osteoporosis medication, and constructing a bathroom with solid materials.

He has been a farmer for over ten years.  His parents gave him some land that he uses to plant alfalfa\u2014this is the crop that he produces the most and gets the most return from, since it is harvested six times a year.  Like all parents, he wants to provide the best for his two children, aged 11 and 6 years old.  He also grows fruits such as apples and quinces along with other crops that include corn, peas, spinach, and potatoes.  He needed a loan in order to purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides.  He sells his produce to wholesale buyers from the market.  Adr\u00edan and his wife share the expenses of educating their children and providing them with clothes and food.

They had to look for a way to generate their own incomes through their businesses, with the objective supporting their households economically.\r\n\r\nDoris is 36 years old, and is the mother of three children aged 15, 13 and 5.  When she was 29 she took the initiative to start preparing meals typical of the sierra region (wheat soup, noodles, spicy wheat, dried potatoes, yuyo); she took them in baskets and pots out to sell in the markets to the vendors and people passing through.  She was there for a fair amount of time and her sales were very good; the traders liked her food as this type of meal was not generally available.  The income from these sales paid for her food expenses, and for her children's education at the time when her husband did not have a job.  Later, she stopped selling because she had to care for her last child, but this did not stop her from beginning to sell groceries from the house.  With money that she saved from her previous work she bought: a sack of rice, 1 1\/2 sacks of sugar, a dozen units of milk and tuna, salt and detergent.  Loans that she received in the past enabled her to set up her business and  generate more income so that she was be able to buy school supplies for her children and enroll them in school.  In addition she improved her home, installing a tank of potable water and putting in an iron window.  This business pays for her family's expenses, given that the salary of her partner is not sufficient to cover them.  Doris wants a better quality of life for her children and to finish construction on her home.  With this loan she will buy sweets, milk, cooking oil, toilet paper, tuna and soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nJuana is 47 years old and is the mother of 2 children.  She and her partner have a business selling fish from a stand.  To do this she gets up very early at 5:30am to buy the merchandise that she needs at the fishing terminal Villa Mar\u00eda in Lima.  She does this at least 3 times a week, buying from 20 to 40 kilos of bonito, mackerel, swordfish, parrot fish, and other fish.  The income from this business helps her husband with the household expenses.  This loan will be used to buy bonito and mackerel, which are the types of fish that are most in demand by her customers.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":461672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy supplies: groceries and fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-02T19:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yulissa Nathaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madey Celinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ybette Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicky Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rocio Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7400,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1850},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1850},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1850},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":643.75,"local_amount":1850,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064635,"comment":null},{"amount":643.75,"local_amount":1850,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899694,"comment":null},{"amount":643.75,"local_amount":1850,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933777,"comment":null},{"amount":643.75,"local_amount":1850,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661370,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:21:39Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166260,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a young Palestinian man, age 27, who is married with two children.\r\n\r\nAhmad owns a barber shop where he cuts hair, shaves beards and sells creams.

Each group member is applying for a loan of 100,000 colons. The women partake in various revenue-generating activities such as the production and sale of homemade bread or clothing as well as the sale of catalogue items such as cosmetics and health products.\r\n\r\nThe women who sell catalogue items can earn a 20% margin for their efforts. This loan will be used to purchase inventory items as well as raw materials for clothes and bread making. It will also be used for general investments for the expansion of each woman\u2019s business. The goals of this group are to help each other sell more products and ensure the good health of each member.\r\n\r\nAnay is 57 years old, divorced, and has three daughters. Although she did not finish primary school, she has completed some technical courses in sewing. She has a business selling various catalogue items such as cosmetics, health products and clothing, going from door to door in her community. She started her business with an initial investment of 10,000 colons and, in a good month, she can earn 92,000 colons.\r\n\r\nAnay plans to use the current loan for the purchase of inventory products which she will then be able to sell to her clients on credit. She mentioned that her business is growing and she hopes this loan will help her expand, offer her better deals and broaden her client base. She recognizes that the main need of her clients is good health, which her products help provide.\r\n\r\nYessenia sells handmade clothing to clients in her community. She is 29 years old and has completed primary school. She plans to use this loan to purchase raw materials necessary for making clothes. She says that she hopes that by joining the group, she will learn from her fellow members how to run an efficient enterprise and to make wise business investments. She describes the relationships amongst the group members as \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cunited\u201d.\r\n\r\nYessenia\u2019s aim is to combine this loan and the business wisdom of her colleagues in order to generate more family income. She says, \u201cI would like to be able to give my children some treats once in a while, like ice cream.\u201d Her goal is to increase business growth, to keep learning every day and to re-invest in her business - \u201cto make every day better than the last.\u201d With her faith and the group, she feels that she can achieve these goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":462590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Pocosi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-01-03T03:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yarleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosibel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cindel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":127884.9},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":130016.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":132183.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":134386.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136626.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138903.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":227.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.6},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":227.79,"local_amount":127886.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":128364.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077210,"comment":null},{"amount":231.63,"local_amount":130038.11,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":130524.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913481,"comment":null},{"amount":235.49,"local_amount":132205.41,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":132699.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949183,"comment":null},{"amount":239.42,"local_amount":134408.83,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":134911.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678082,"comment":null},{"amount":243.37,"local_amount":136628.81,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":137139.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712555,"comment":null},{"amount":247.3,"local_amount":138832.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":139351.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047916,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T14:38:49Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166271,"name":"Mai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mai A.

Helen is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional rice to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Helen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Myrna has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Myrna joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This will be the first loan taken out by Myrna from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Mama needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 40 talas or US $17 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Mama's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university. \"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

F. is 62 and married with 8 children (ages 22 - 40).  She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Alofa has 7 years of experience in this business.  Alofa needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 700 talas or US $292 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Alofa joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Alofa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

I. is 28 and married with 4 children (ages 7 - 2-months).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ena has 2 years of experience in this business.  Ena needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ena joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ena's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

A. is 22 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Faasoesa has 1 year of experience in this business.  Faasoesa needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faasoesa joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasoesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

is 48 and married with 1 child.  She owns & operates a business venture, selling bamboo handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Otilia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 40 talas or US $17 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nOtilia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Otilia's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3 \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

is 34 and married with 7 children.  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Pasikalia needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 35 talas or US $15 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nPasikalia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Pasikalia's 7th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

P. is 30 and married with 5 children (ages 4-19).  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Pelepesite has 3 years of experience in this business.  Pelepesite needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Pelepesite joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Pelepesite's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

is 36 and married with 1 child.  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Seepa needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 35 talas or US $15 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSeepa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Seepa's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

K. is 37 and married with 5 children (ages 4 - 17).  She owns a business venture, selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, plantains).  Usuese  has many years of experience in this business.  Usuese  needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Usuese  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Usuese 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Usuese K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

is 39 and married with 3 children.  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Leao needs a loan of WST $2450 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 40 talas or US $17 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Leao's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

Elicita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the second loan taken out by Elicita from GDMPC.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as milo (sachet), shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Rosela has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosela joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosela is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rosela from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They met through family and community links. These women are working with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance organisation in order to satisfy the demands of their ever-increasing customer base. They are now on their seventh loan and all previous loans have been successfully repaid. They intend to use this loan in order to buy 30 cartloads of firewood, 50 bags of coal, two bags of sugar, three packs of tea, 50 litres of milk and a large number of credit cards bought in Bamako.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arceli T. is from the village of San Isidro, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 55 years old. Arceli is the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nArceli is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Arceli owns & operates a business selling fish, fruits and vegetables. Arceli has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately PHP 600 weekly. Aside from vending, Arceli also raises hogs.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Arceli joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arceli is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase hog feed. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Arceli from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernadette B. is from the village of Pulay, Luna, Isabela. She is 37 years old. Bernadette is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nBernadette is single and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Bernadette owns & operates a general store where she sells food & daily use products in the local community. Bernadette has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bernadette joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bernadette is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Bernadette from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":463235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

As her husband's salary from brick laing only covered their food costs, Beatriz was anxious to learn a trade in order to help him out with their kids' school fees; so a friend of hers offered to teach her how to make pi\u00f1atas.  From there she thought it was a good idea, and so improvised some tools to help her make the pi\u00f1atas.  As her orders grew larger she decided to get together with other people who had the same needs as her to form a group that would ask for credit through the Realidad Foundations.  Her business has prospered & throughout the year she works very hard so that when the high season arrives she has enough stock to offer in local markets.  She has achieved all this with the help of her family.  She wants her business to grow & to get her own mode of transport which would help to increase her earnings & allow her to be a source of employment for someone else.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are:\r\n\r\nV\u00edctor Fidel R.

arriving in the United States thirty years ago from the western coast of Greece, Athanasios quickly applied his entrepreneurial spirit to start his own hotdog food cart. For the past twenty-six years, Athanasios has built a regular clientele of diverse Manhattan clients. He says that people appreciate his clean and friendly service.\r\n\r\nAthanasios is a longtime ACCION USA client who has always paid on time. He chooses to borrow from ACCION USA because of the trusting relationship that he has built over the years. With his current loan he will be purchasing food inventory that includes hotdogs, sausages, and buns.\r\n\r\nAthanasios says that his business is very dependent upon the weather. Since his business is based outdoors, he is busiest in the summer months but he operates year-round in almost all types of weather.\r\n\r\nWatch a short interview with Athanasios from ACCION USA on Vimeo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vimeo.com\/8475934\" TARGET=\"_new\" > here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":461598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To buy hotdogs, sausages, buns and other food inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New York, New York","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2010-01-04T16:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anthanasios","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":175.92},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":177.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":178.24},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":179.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":180.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":181.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":182.97},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":184.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":185.39},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":186.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":187.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.92},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.24},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.39},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175.92,"local_amount":175.92,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":175.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123838943,"comment":null},{"amount":177.08,"local_amount":177.08,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":177.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128871916,"comment":null},{"amount":178.24,"local_amount":178.24,"processed_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":178.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136602136,"comment":null},{"amount":179.41,"local_amount":179.41,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":179.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144637603,"comment":null},{"amount":180.59,"local_amount":180.59,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":180.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151819548,"comment":null},{"amount":181.78,"local_amount":181.78,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T07:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":181.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159717014,"comment":null},{"amount":182.97,"local_amount":182.97,"processed_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":182.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166768811,"comment":null},{"amount":184.18,"local_amount":184.18,"processed_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":184.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172037642,"comment":null},{"amount":185.39,"local_amount":185.39,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T11:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":185.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177328537,"comment":null},{"amount":186.61,"local_amount":186.61,"processed_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":186.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182463606,"comment":null},{"amount":187.83,"local_amount":187.83,"processed_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":187.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189096072,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-05T02:58:09Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:00:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166387,"name":"St. Mary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort is a forty-nine year old married mother of two children, both of whom are in school.

She is very pleased to work with the Foundation; thanks to the loans she has taken she has been able to improve herself both personally and in her work.  She hopes to continue working for the welfare of her family.  She sells at a snack bar during school recess from 12 to 12:30 from Mondays to Fridays.  In addition, she sells clothing in the streets.  With the loan she obtained through the Foundation she has managed to increase her business.  Now she has various orders from her customers, principally from Montechristi and Manta; the majority of them are her relatives and neighbors.  She travels every 2 months to Guayaquil to acquire merchandise directly from the distributors to increase her earnings.  Once she collects the orders she hopes to gather the money and continue buying to satisfy the orders of her select clientele.  Now she will invest the loan in her 2 businesses; she will buy bread, potatoes, candy, and soft drinks to supply her snack bar, and in addition she will acquire pants, shirts, blouses and women's underwear for her clothing business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":461175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy bread, potatoes, candy, and soft drinks, pants, shirts, blouses and women's underwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-01-04T16:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074659,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074660,"comment":null},{"amount":263.39,"local_amount":257.54,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":263.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910648,"comment":null},{"amount":74.11,"local_amount":72.46,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":74.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946286,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946287,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946288,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674615,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-05T18:56:28Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166389,"name":"Sophia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophia is a forty-nine year old married mother of seven children.

She treks to farming communities to buy her stock of goods from the farmers. This saves her from intermediaries who buy from the farmers and resell to her at a higher price. She wants to use the loan to buy bulk supply of cassava, plantain and vegetables, etc. to meet the daily demands of her customers. She hopes to use part of her profit to support her kids in school and would be grateful for your assistance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":463568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy bulk supply of yam, cassava, plantain and vegetables etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Konongo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2010-01-04T17:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agatha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":167.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123987725,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":167.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129018424,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":167.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136743263,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144775990,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":167.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151958369,"comment":null},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":167.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159697076,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-05T00:14:10Z","paid_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166405,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena is 37years old.

Nevertheless, the region is one of the poorest in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in merchandise by the \u201cEl Progreso\u201d group, in order to increase their supplies and earnings.\r\n\r\nMarcela, a representative of the group, is pictured in the front row in a black athletic suit with a fuchsia colored T-shirt. She sells underwear and socks for men, and like the other members of the group, she sells them from a stall on one of the main streets in the city of Linares. These stalls are free to use, as they have been constructed by the government for the use of small business owners.\r\n\r\nMarcela\u2019s dream is to achieve economic stability for her family and to continue funding her children\u2019s education, while also caring for her two-year-old nephew.\r\n\r\nFor Marcela, Fondo Esperanza has been the motivating force behind her business\u2019s growth because, before the loans, Marcela never had the funding to grow her business. Also, Marcela believes she has benefitted greatly from the training courses that are taught at their weekly communal bank meetings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":463624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more merchandise for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Linares","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-01-05T01:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eradie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arlette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaspar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1056702,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":73705},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":74192},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":74677},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75169},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":56467},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76032},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":76530},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":77034},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":77539},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":78045},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78552},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79070},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79590},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.4},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.1},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1049.66,"local_amount":528182,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":532652.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072565,"comment":null},{"amount":419.74,"local_amount":211208,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":212995.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944196,"comment":null},{"amount":630.6,"local_amount":317312,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":319997.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136672653,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-06T00:31:46Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166426,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha, trabaja en la Polic\u00eda Nacional desempe\u00f1ando el cargo de polic\u00eda en seguridad Ciudadana.\nSu domicilio se encuentran ubicados en la zona de Tembladerani de la ciudad de La Paz vive en la casa de sus padres.\nEl cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 destinado para educaci\u00f3n (pago de un curso de actualizaci\u00f3n para polic\u00edas).

Celia and her husband Simon are a very hard-working couple that live well and planned to buy a car in addition to the one they have. They sought a loan from another financial institution for an amount of US $600. The loan was paid out and a few hours after Simon was working with the car he suffered a grave accident, because of which the entire amount of the loan was spent on his operation. After 1 year of physiotherapy and hard work on Celia's part, they have left this bad period and are investing more money because of the amount of orders Celia has at the end of the year. The loan is destined to be used to increased her capital and to bring more merchandise from Peru.

So, one year ago Rosmeri installed a grocery store in their house with the intention to help support her family. Normally she offers her customers and neighbours essential products such as rice, sugar, oil, groceries and vegetables.\r\n\r\nHer business has been received well, owing to the fact that it is the only one that exists in the zone. Rosmeri wants to increase her business with the purchase of more groceries and essential products but doesn't have the necessary capital to realise this action. For this reason for the first time she is seeking a loan from Edpyme Alternativa of 500 nuevos soles which she thinks of using to achieve her objective. \r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to be able to expand her business to make improvements to her house and assure her son a quality education.

He lives in the community of San Miguel Xico, 1st section, Valley of Chalco Solidaridad, in the State of Mexico.\n\nAlvaro used to work as a butcher in a meat shop, earning a salary which more or less provided for basic expenses.  But it didn't cover all of his necessities.  For that reason, he decided to open his own business selling beef.  He has been attending this business for about 1 year and 3 months.  Although his business has prospered, he would like to increase his earnings by selling pork.  But he lacks the money to invest.\n\nRecently, he joined others he knew who have similar needs in approaching Fundacion Realidad to solicit a loan to help obtain the funds he needed to invest in his business.
