They use candles for illumination, which does not afford them many advantages in their efforts to get ahead.  For this reason, she has requested a solar panel with which to provide light.  Upon its purchase, she turned to CEPRODEL to obtain a loan to pay for the panel.  This installation will greatly help her and her family, which is composed of her four small children. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nLa se\u00f1ora Maria V. es una persona que desde hace varios a\u00f1os ha venido desempe\u00f1\u00e1ndose en el negocio agropecuario en el municipio de El Sauce de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n.

Faced with a lack of funds for running her fish selling business, she decided to join one of Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s solidarity loan associations. After four solidarity loans, she has moved on to an individual loan. All previous loans were repaid successfully. She buys her stock mainly in Bobo Dioulasso (a town in the West African republic of Burkina Faso) and sometimes in Bamako (Mali\u2019s capital). She plans to use this loan to buy 20 cases of fish and ice on a daily basis. She sells every day along Highway 2000 in M\u00e9dine, S\u00e9gou. Sales are midway between wholesale and retail, or retail, and are generally paid for in cash.  Because of the quick turnover of fish, she expects to make a monthly profit of CFA 90,000. This profit will be used to pay the interest on the loan, to pay for ice, for savings, and to contribute to the family\u2019s expenses.

However, this region is rich in natural resources and mostly fishery products (oysters, shellfish, shrimps, cymbium and fish) . This is why we came to sollicit SEM so they could find us financing from Kiva in order for us to work. Our work will consist of fishing and transformation of fishery production (smoking, drying and salting of fish). We are also planning on selling fresh fish, because Djirack is a very important fishing harbor in the region situated nearby the resort of Cap Skirring. \r\nTranslated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.\r\n\r\nNous habitons l'\u00e9covillage de Djirack qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 son sort depuis le d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 80, \u00e0 cause du conflit arm\u00e9 qui s\u00e9vissait dans la r\u00e9gion Sud du s\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

She listened to them, and that's how her business came to be.\r\n<p>\r\nShe felt the need to open the business because of her family's low income.

She has brought in good earnings, which have allowed her to pay for severla unforseen expenses.

She is divorced and the mother of two boys, both working in South Africa.  \r\n<p>\r\nFlorencia lived with her parents until 12 years old, when they got divorced and she moved with her mother and brothers to her grandparents\u2019 house. Florencia only studied until 8th grade. Due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation she had to start working quite young, getting a job as a house maid at 16 years old. When Florencia was 18 years old she got pregnant and went to live with her husband. A few years later Florencia got divorced and moved back to her mother\u2019s house. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 1998 Florencia started to sell sandwiches and juices in her neighborhood and liked the commerce business. In 2002 some friends invited her to go to South Africa to buy products to sell in Mozambique. She first started selling clothes and then changed to food products.\r\n<p>\r\nFlorencia works at this until today. She goes to South Africa once or twice per month and together with friends rents a car and brings the products to Mozambique. Florencia does not have a store; she provides the merchandise to some stores (such as the one in the picture) and uses her house as a warehouse to stock merchandise. Florencia has a monthly income of approximately MTn 40,000 and reports that the most lucrative periods are the weekends. Her most wanted products are eggs, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Florencia has three employees who help her deliver the merchandise and collect payment: two women who are married and have children who Florencia pays MTn 1,700 monthly and one young man who she pays MTn 1,300 monthly. Florencia has a monthly profit of around MTn 8,500 that she uses to support her family (including parents and some siblings). \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Florencia\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva.

I launched my business 15 years ago, with a capital of Q.500.00. As time went by I started to get new clients and I am now selling in different towns and villages where I offer my products on the streets. About 6 years ago, my sister introduced the idea of also selling beauty products through catalogs. Since I already had a good number of clients, the products we well received.<p>\r\n\r\nThanks to the Lord people have been ordering clothing and beauty products, therefore I am in need of more capital to be able to fulfill their orders. Now that everything has gone up in price one needs to invest more in the merchandise, especially if one wants to have the items clients request readily available. My goal with this loan is to be able to take advantage of the season, in which people request large orders, due to the town celebrations that are soon to come. <p>\r\n\r\nI always work hard to get ahead and take good care of my two children, especially now that I don't live with my husband. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Libertad Leal, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoy AnaDela B.

is 46 years old and originally from Matutuine district in the Maputo Province. Benjamin is married and the father of five children: the oldest with 24 years old and the youngest with 5 years old. Besides his children, Benjamin also supports two nephews from a deceased brother. \r\n<p>\r\nBenjamin studied until 3rd grade and stopped due to his family\u2019s difficult financial situation. At the age of 15 years he started fishing with his father, but soon stopped to join the obligatory military service. In 1988 Benjamin was involved in an ambush and lost both legs. Benjamin decided to move to Maputo rather than returning to Matutuine due to the civil war that was intense in the countryside. Benjamin started to repair shoes and only in 1998 started to receive a pension from the government.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004 Benjamin decided to go back to Bela Vista in Matutuine with plans to work in an agricultural field, but the lack of rain didn\u2019t allow him to proceed with his plans. He then went back to repairing shoes and also started to sell used clothes, blankets and duvets in a small stand. Benjamin\u2019s wife goes to South Africa to sell pans and buys the blankets and duvets that are then sold in Mozambique. During wintertime the sale of blankets and duvets intensifies. Benjamin\u2019s wife buys them for MTn 350 and he sells them for MTn 800 each.\r\n<p>\r\nBenjamim is an old client of Hluvuku. His last loan was used to buy some consumer goods such as a fridge and a radio and his second to last loan was used to pay his son\u2019s medical expenses, as he stayed three months in the hospital with cancer.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Benjamin would like to go back to fishing.

The group currently has 45 registered members although only 40 are active. The members have also been trained by K-MET in Nutrition Support, Home Based Care services, and IGA (income generating activity) Management. The group is run by the Executive which is comprised of the Chairperson, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Organizing Secretary, and the Treasurer. Those who are willing to join the group are required to meet certain conditions including paying a registration fee. Members are involved in well-established income generating activities such as poultry keeping, dairy farming, cereal businesses, vegetable sales, and community pharmacies. Since HIV\/Aids is a concern in this area and nutrition supplements have played a role in HIV\/Aids management, the group has applied for US $4000 from K-MET to enable them to buy Nutriflour in bulk and sell it to the community.\r\n<p><i>\r\nDisclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.
