Debido a que en su tienda no cuenta con un refrigerador en el cual pueda ofrecer productos que requieran de refrigeraci\u00f3n, Marta busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de un refrigerador y poder as\u00ed ofrecer productos que requieran de refrigeraci\u00f3n.\n\nMarta espera que de esta manera su negocio crezca cada vez m\u00e1s y pueda mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia. Marta sue\u00f1a con tener un gran negocio que le garantice grandes ingresos y de esta manera pueda evitar las dificultades econ\u00f3micas que se le han presentado y poder seguir progresando en la vida.  \n","en":"Marta started doing sewing and weaving to generate income to support her home. When she saw the need in the market she opened a general store where she offers all types of products for the basic family basket. In her store, Marta is known for offering very good products and offering very good service. This has allowed her to have a lot of customers and guarantee good sales. Marta has the difficulty of having to take care of her father. He is very ill and elderly. This prevents her from keeping her business open all the time she would like to for her customers. Despite this, her business' good reputation has made her customers bring good sales and her business grow little by little over time. Due to the fact that her business doesn't have a refrigerator for refrigerated products, Marta is seeking a loan to have the opportunity to purchase a refrigerator and be able to offer refrigerated products.    \r\n\r\nMarta hopes that this will make her business grow even more and help her improve her and her family's quality of life. Marta dreams of having a big business that will guarantee good income and thus avoid the financial difficulties she has encountered and be able to keep progressing in life.    \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1056953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a refrigerator so she can offer products that require refrigeration.

Single, she manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGloria operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business soon. \r\n\r\nGloria dreams of growing her business in the coming years.

So over two years ago she bought her first vehicle and in time has been renovating and buying others.  She likes her business because it allows her to have income to cover family expenses.  But she doesn\u2019t like it when her mototaxi breaks down often because this causes many expenses.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to continuously support her children.

Fue as\u00ed como inici\u00f3 con una chaza de venta de dulces, que posteriormente cambi\u00f3 a un carro para preparar raspados, y de esta manera pudo continuar generando los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar. Ya hace 40 a\u00f1os que Jose viene ejerciendo esta actividad y con la cual le ha podido brindar a su familia una buena calidad de vida, sin embargo, el motor del carro con el que prepara los raspados se ha da\u00f1ado, por lo que est\u00e1 en busca de un pr\u00e9stamo que le permita comprar un nuevo motor para su carro donde prepara los raspados. \n\nJose espera que de esta manera pueda seguir ejerciendo su actividad sin inconvenientes y as\u00ed seguir generando los ingresos que requiere para el sostenimiento de su hogar. \n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a person who has always been noted for loving his work and his family very much which has allowed him to overcome great adversities life has presented him.

Today she sells used clothes for women, men, boys and girls, and also has a photocopy machine which earns her a little extra. She tends her business herself, and her day starts at 7 am and ends at 8 pm. Her greatest advantage is that she doesn't neglect her family on account of her business, since she sells the clothing in her own home and doesn't have to pay rent for a shop. \r\n\r\nJulia Cecilia is requesting this loan in order to purchase bundles of used clothing in summery styles to attract more attention during Holy Week, and in this way increase her sales. This will greatly benefit her and her family. Her dream is to make her business grow and branch out into different product lines. This will be her fifth loan from FAMA and she expects to continue fulfilling her commitment by making her payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1057438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase bundles of used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-04-09T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-09T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":2950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elida Rosa","last_name":"Navarro Matute","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Maria ","last_name":"Escobar Murillo","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Cecilia","last_name":"Cibrian Matute","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina Rumilda","last_name":"Turcios","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":56000,"loan_amount":2950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9333.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9333.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409726,"name":"Adelina De Jesus Torres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adelina siempre se ha caracterizado por ser una persona muy trabajadora y siempre querer ofrecer a su familia una buena calidad de vida y una mayor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.

She is single with no children, and lives with her older sister in the town of Koutiala (Sikasso region). She left school early, due to family problems, and took up revenue-generating activities, most notably the sale of wax and other types of fabric, work she has been doing for 3 years, with her sister.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy a growing clientele, Modiere decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso institution 10 months ago. This will be her first individual loan. She plans to use this loan to buy 10 pieces of wax fabric and various other items in Bamako.\r\n\r\nModiere is a street vendor and she sells her wares in the different districts of Koutiala town, as well as at home, to a clientele made up of women and men, mostly for credit. She expects to earn a monthly profit of 30 000 francs which she plans to use to repay the interest on her loan from Soro Yiriwaso, as well as to cover her basic needs. She would like to reinvest the rest of her profits into the expansion of her business. Very ambitious, Modiere intends to open her own shop selling fabrics and other products at the Koutiala Grand Market.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1065803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy pieces of wax and embroidered fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-04-09T18:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-09T18:50:07Z","loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modiere ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409733,"name":"Bertha Maria Mena Diaz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bertha anteriormente trabajaba en un restaurante cocinando y dado a que manten\u00eda durante mucho tiempo de pie comenz\u00f3 a enfermarse y se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de dejar su trabajo.

As well, with the delicious aroma that spreads out during the process, her customers will buy everything she prepares in her bakery and Mayerlin can repeat the popular proverb: \u201ceverything is selling like hot cakes,\u201d indicating that things are moving along effectively.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1058560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour, sugar, fats and miscellaneous supplies, paying in cash and in greater volume to get a discount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-04-10T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-10T01:00:03Z","loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayerlin ","last_name":"Mancilla Quintero","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68513},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82089},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84004},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85964},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":87970},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90023},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92123},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94273},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96473},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98724},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":101027},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118817}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410711,"name":"Alsla Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called ALSLA.
