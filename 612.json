They live in traditional families. Their average age is 47 and they have at least 9 children.  They cultivate peanuts, millet, and okra.  In order to make their farms profitable, the members of the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program two years ago.  After fully repaying their prior loan, they are on their second loan.  The current loan for BINTOU, the first person seated at the left, in a red t-shirt, will be used to pay for a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, labor costs of plowing, small equipment, and agricultural inputs for cultivation, at the main market in city of SAN.  After the rainy season, the harvest will be stored for a certain period of time so that it has value before being sold at the main market of SAN and at other nearby markets. Sales are retail (often wholesale), in cash, to customers who usually come from large cities.  The members of the group intend to each make, after the distribution and sale of their agricultural products, a profit of 18000 to 40000 FCFA  which will be used to pay the interest on the loan and household expenses.

His two children attend a secondary school. Mr. Enkhbold is mining engineer and he works for Olon Ovoot Gold Mining company as a field operator. His family owns a plot of land and has a small family house on it. The house is small and old and since their children are growing up, they need more space and separate rooms. \r\n\r\nEnkhbold is building a bigger house for his family. The project was started last year and it was stopped due to lack of funding.

The group members grow peanuts, okra, beans, etc. \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their plantations profitable, the group members decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago. After properly repaying the previous loans, they are now on their second farm loan.\r\n\r\nHAWA, who is standing in the middle in the photo and carrying a child on her back, intends to use her loan to buy a sufficient amount of peanut seeds, to pay for plowing and weeding, and to buy sundry supplies and equipment and some inputs for farming. These items are purchased at the main market of Kimparana City. Following the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain value. And then they are sold retail (and often wholesale) and for cash at the main market of Kimparana and at the surrounding markets. The customers generally come from large cities. \r\n\r\nAfter selling the produce, the group members each plan on making a profit of 24,000 to 26,000 francs CFA that will be used for repaying the loan interest and for covering typical family expenses. \u00a0\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":790763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy inputs and tools and to pay for plowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kafono","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kilindjre ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gniokoro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noutegue ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba Dra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnire Kafa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Worowe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":435000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":435000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":435000,"processed_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":445755.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T06:01:25Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306604,"name":"Masika","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Masika est entrepreneur, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 48 ans, veuve, m\u00e8re de 4 enfants, tous \u00e9tudient.

The women live in traditional families with their husbands, children, and other parents. And they average 39 years of age and have at least six children. The group members grow peanuts, okra, beans, etc.\r\n\r\nConcerned about making their plantations profitable, the group members decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago. After properly repaying the previous loans, they are now on their second farm loan.\r\n\r\nKORO, who is standing in the middle in the photo and dressed in blue, intends to use her loan to buy a sufficient amount of peanut seeds, to pay for plowing and weeding, and to buy sundry supplies and equipment and some inputs for farming. These items are purchased at the main market of Kimparana City. Following the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain value. And then they are sold retail (and often in bulk) and for cash at the main market of Kimparana and at the surrounding markets. The customers generally come from large cities.\r\n\r\nAfter selling the produce, the group members each plan on making a profit of 26,000 to 29,000 francs CFA that will be used for repaying the loan interest and for covering typical family expenses. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":790768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farm inputs, seeds, and tools and to pay for plowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kafono","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u2019Kotio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanouya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katagnon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naony ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":335000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":335000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":335000,"processed_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":342889.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283072,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-06T02:39:50Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306610,"name":"Munavar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Munavar is a widow with two children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These items are purchased at the main market of SAN City. Following the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain value. And then they are sold retail (and often in bulk) and for cash at the main markets of SAN and DAH and at the surrounding markets. The customers generally come from large cities.\r\n\r\nAfter selling the produce, the group members each plan on making a profit of 13,000 to 81,000 francs CFA that will be used for repaying the loan interest and for covering typical family expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":790776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farm inputs, seeds, and tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Cinzara","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dounaba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djonko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tegnere ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nio Seydou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zele Dramane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":260000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":260000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":260000,"processed_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":262881.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283073,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-03T21:30:46Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306615,"name":"Eugenie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eugenie is 35 years old and has six children between the ages of 17 and 35.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thanks to a dozen years of experience selling condiments and miscellaneous articles, she is very much in demand and appreciated.\r\nSeven years ago, to fight small product shortages she experienced and which caused her to lose some of her customers, she decided to join Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance organization to increase her customer satisfaction. After eight solidarity loans (group loans), all of which were successfully repaid, she is now in her fourth individual loan; previous loans have been successfully repaid.\r\nShe intends on purchasing four bags of onions, three packages of soap and many other small articles with this loan.

She lives with her husband, her co-wife, and their children in the Sogomougou district of Koutiala City. \u00a0Due to family problems, Mariam could not continue with her schooling, which is why she soon became interested  in commerce at an early age, along side her mom. After having run several revenue-generating businesses, she opted in the end to buy and sell peanuts and has been doing so for twenty years now. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase her working capital and to expand her business, Mariam turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso seven years ago.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Over time, she decided to set up her grocery store business so that she could improve her income.\r\n\r\nBertha's biggest wish is to be able to continue working with this business and her loan and, with God's help, get ahead in life with her small family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":789805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy merchandise such as sugar, oil, corn meal, cookies, eggs, etc. with which to stock her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-06-15T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1309.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512763,"comment":null},{"amount":330,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3928.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223409,"comment":null},{"amount":220,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2619.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201686,"comment":null},{"amount":220,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2619.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807276,"comment":null},{"amount":220,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2619.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618405,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-16T15:06:10Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306858,"name":"Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esperanza tiene 52 a\u00f1os, ella tiene cierto tiempo de trabajar con Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 por lo que su record crediticio es muy bueno.

His corral is located in the rear of his house for better security and comfort.  His animals sell quickly at the markets he sells them at because they are well fed with nutritionally balanced feed and natural grasses which allows him to increase his profits to meet daily needs.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Elvis has asked Edpyme Alternativa for a 1000 new sol loan to buy animals and their respective feed.  By increasing his sales he\u2019ll be able to repay the loan and improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\nElvis is knows by all the local merchants and in the various markets where he sells his products for being an honest, hard working man with a strong drive to improve his life to continue helping his parents economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":267.18,"image":{"id":791374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animals and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tongorrape - Motupe - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-07-03T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvis Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.95},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":84.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":89.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.86},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.29},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.2,"local_amount":139.19,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":144.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222206008,"comment":null},{"amount":28.29,"local_amount":75.46,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":78.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182772,"comment":null},{"amount":28.55,"local_amount":76.11,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":78.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232779726,"comment":null},{"amount":29.49,"local_amount":78.65,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":81.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584276,"comment":null},{"amount":30.73,"local_amount":81.95,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542455,"comment":null},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":84.59,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":87.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752977,"comment":null},{"amount":32.56,"local_amount":86.82,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":89.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257395013,"comment":null},{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":89.72,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":92.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T00:57:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306941,"name":"Betzabe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Betzabe tiene 21 a\u00f1os de edad, el cuenta con casa propia la cual est\u00e1 ubicada en un caser\u00edo del  distrito de Tambogrande en Piura ,es un caser\u00edo mediano con deseos de superaci\u00f3n.\n\nBetzabe  se dedica a la venta de productos de primera necesidad, atendiendo todos los d\u00edas de la semana en su negocio el cual ha instalado en su casa, adem\u00e1s se dedica a la crianza de aves de corral.

It is here that she manages several businesses.  She launched her first business seven years ago selling fast food and lunches.  From that point, she also began selling products through specialized catalogs and renting out washing machines.  Her main target customers are women with families, and each of her businesses reaches out to that demographic.  Mirela gained her experience while working as an employee for different companies.  This sparked her entrepreneurial spirit despite the fact that she had very little capital.  Her resources gradually increased over time.  She has been able to accomplish all of this with the full support of her husband and the motivation he provides.  Her dream is to have her own shop where she can establish her fast food business and generate jobs so that all of her children can get ahead.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Mirela\u2019s first loan.  She will use the Kiva funds to buy cooking utensils, pots, plates, chairs, and tables to improve the physical infrastructure of her food business.

All of her children work independently and have learned to be just as enterprising as their mother.  For the past 20 years, Olinda has been selling lunches, especially coastal stews that are prepared with vegetables and up to three types of meat.  She started this business after managing a store where she threw out vegetables, bones, and beef ribs.  At that moment, she began making soups and selling them with the help of her children.  Olinda sold them every day from her store and would have more than 50 customers.  As soon as she was in a position to start selling lunches, Olinda put her entire store up for lease and decided to stick with her new venture.  All of the work she has accomplished is represented by these two businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nOlinda is currently requesting her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because she wants to strengthen her food business and increase her operating capital with Kiva funds.  She will buy in bulk provisions, drinks, rice, grain, and general supplies for preparing her dishes.  Olinda knows that buying in large amounts is more effective because she can obtain very good discounts, generate better earnings, and continue improving her profit margin which is currently at a minimum of 20%.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400.66,"image":{"id":791386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase provisions, drinks, rice, grain, and general supplies in bulk for preparing her dishes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-17T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":80154},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":81690},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83256},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":84851},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":86478},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":88135},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":89824},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":91546},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93301},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":95089},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96912},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98764}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.61},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.82,"local_amount":80154,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":83103.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673838,"comment":null},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":81690,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320395,"comment":null},{"amount":48.63,"local_amount":83256,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":86319.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803514,"comment":null},{"amount":49.56,"local_amount":84851,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87973.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614601,"comment":null},{"amount":50.51,"local_amount":86478,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":89660.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568557,"comment":null},{"amount":51.48,"local_amount":88135,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91378.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779898,"comment":null},{"amount":52.47,"local_amount":89824,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":93129.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188291,"comment":null},{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":91546,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":94914.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324520,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-17T12:11:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306987,"name":"Seng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seng, age 44, is married with four children, two of whom are themselves married.
