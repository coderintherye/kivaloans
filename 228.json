He is quite fulfilled in his business because he sees it as a win-win situation. There is a high surplus of scrap metal in the U.S. and a high demand for scrap metal to be used for construction in India. \n\nHardyar came to ACCION USA to find the capital for start-up costs and was approved for a loan. This is his first loan through ACCION USA and he plans to expand very soon. He enjoys this work because it comes easily to him and he loves to be able to set and achieve his own goals for his business. \n\nThanks to the flexibility of his job as a cab driver, he has time to find metal through the internet and create a contract with business partners in India to buy the metal. Business has gotten off to a good start, he says. He trusts that within the next two years it will be booming and he can take it on full-time.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":330836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase scrap metal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Queens, NY","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2009-06-10T10:30:50Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":6000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hardyal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":174.37},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":230.96},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":233.9},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":239.21},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":239.93},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":245.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":246.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":249.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":257.9},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":255.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":260.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":262.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":267.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":269.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":272.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":276.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":279.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":283.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":286.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":290.28},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":295.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":297.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.37},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.96},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.9},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.9},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.28},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.43},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.74},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":174.37,"local_amount":174.37,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":174.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110182,"comment":null},{"amount":230.96,"local_amount":230.96,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":230.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531629,"comment":null},{"amount":233.9,"local_amount":233.9,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":233.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963190,"comment":null},{"amount":5360.77,"local_amount":5360.77,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5360.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96873498,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-19T22:38:58Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:27:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113644,"name":"Esperanza Y Esfuerzo 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raquel is a mother of two young children ages 4 years and 7 months.

They know how to get ahead, though, especially when they have the trust of an organization that is always inclined to help its members buy materials, supplies, and tools so their businesses can generate more income and their families can enjoy a better quality of life.  A large proportion of the members have prior experience working with Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital so they know how to work alone as well as the responsibility required to be part of a group.<br

They are building their own house to give their daughter a better standard of living.  Ever since she has taken on the responsibility of wife and mother, she has looked for ways to generate more income.  Thanks to the support of her sister, she started with cosmetic sales 5 years ago.  First she helped with the sales but little by little she became independent thanks to the large number of customers she had made.  Now she has gone into partnership with her sister.  They make hand-made necklaces at home to later sell at the district fairs.  At the same time they teach jewelry making in some schools.  Ana is very happy since she is gifted at teaching.  In the same way, she tries to turn every social setting into an opportunity to look for people who could turn into potential customers for her business.  Her biggest dream is to have a jewelry business with her sister.  She has been with Microfinanzas PRISMA for 3 years.  She is on her 5th loan.

Her husband had to leave the city to work, leaving her as the head of household.  For the past 20 years she has made a variety of clothing items, which she designs according to models that she sees in catalogs and magazines, to make her clothing something new that attracts people\u2019s attention.  This activity requires a lot of creativity and speed, due to the orders that she is constantly receiving.  She tries to speed up her work until late at night, which has begun to affect her vision because of the effort that she makes.  However, this is not enough to stop her; on the contrary, this motivated her to find new ways to keep on working, one of them being the purchase of a sewing machine that helps her speed up and improve her work.  In the near future Carmen would like to open a general store because she is convinced that over the coming years she will not longer be able to work as a seamstress and she would like to have a business that can cover her expenses during old age.  This is her fifth loan with Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma.  In the time that she has been working with her communal bank she has been compatible with the other members, and together they try to do activities that will bring progress to everyone in the group.  The 1,000 soles that she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of wool for jackets as she has various orders because winter is approaching.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":330899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Buy wool to make jackets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-08T05:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":131.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990721,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":131.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211823,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":131.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641348,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":131.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080788,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":131.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996927,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":131.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842267,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":262.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733890,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

S. is from the village of Lower Langcangan, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental. She is 47 years old. Merly is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Merly owns and operates a business in the food sector, selling hot cake. The main source of income for her business comes primarily from selling hot cake within her local community. Merly has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Merly joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. She wanted to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Merly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. \r\n<p>\r\nMerly is now requesting her second loan from GDMPC. She hopes for a loan in the amount of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase ingredients for making hot cake. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is from the village of Cabunga-an, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 58 years old. Leonora is widowed and has one grown child. To make a living, Leonora owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, operating a \"sari-sari\" or general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Leonora joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. She wanted to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Leonora is requesting a loan in the amount of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Leonora from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Anelyn S.

Her husband is a heavy equipment operator and a cocoland laborer (harvester). Because of the economic crisis they have encountered, she decided to engage in business herself. She registered herself as a dealer of JTY Products, a direct selling company with main products of ready-to-wear clothes, home decor items, and home accessories.

Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia is married with four sister-wives and has eight children. Lydia has seen death come unexpectedly when one of her children was bitten by a snake and died within four hours. In her small village of Baicham, in the hills of Belo, Cameroon, she uses her farm as a source of income for her family. With this loan, Lydia plans to pay for labor costs to clear and weed her farm. She will also use some of the money for home improvement. \r\n<p>\r\nHaving been a farmer for many years, she knows that she will produce a successful crop with this money. She has already contributed 35,000 CFA (about $70) of her own money to these projects. For her house, she has already finished molding the bricks. By employing young adults to work on her farm, i.e. \u201cstopping idleness,\u201d she sees that she is helping the community.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the profits from this loan, she will pay for her children\u2019s school fees, improve her living conditions and increase her farm inputs. This is Lydia\u2019s second loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2008. Lydia takes out GHAPE loans because \u201cGHAPE is out to help the poor\u201d and she prefers paying back her loan in small instalments. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nGrounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and a strong bond of trust has developed between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":331003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay labor costs for clearing and weeding farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Nganti, Belo, N.W.

Mary plans to buy cassava and potatoes for farming, manure to fertilize her fields, corn and pineapple. Mary also intends to purchase piglets and chickens. These animals can be useful as an investment and also as fertilizer for one\u2019s farm. Lastly, Mary will buy some small garage tools. \r\n<p>\r\nMary has been a farmer for many years and has experience using loans to fund her farm business. This is Mary\u2019s fourth loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2005. She knows from her past experience that she can take on a loan of this size and be successful. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore she joined GHAPE, her life was very difficult. Her father passed when she was only 13, ending her education. She says she was forced to marry early and since then has lost her husband to a protracted illness leaving her to support her eight children. Mary was \u201cfinancially not okay,\u201d as she could not cover basic needs. \r\n<p>\r\nMary is a GHAPE member because \u201cGHAPE\u2026empowers the poor\u201d and \u201chas trained me and equipped me with prosperous knowledge.\u201d After being with GHAPE for three years, she has \u201cdiscovered the benefits of being a GHAPE member.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nWith the profits from this loan she will pay for her children\u2019s school fees, provide the best for her children and finish the housing projects her husband left behind. She also wants to save a reasonable percentage in her GHAPE savings account. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nGrounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

is a single mother of three children. She has a farm where she grows vegetables to sell at the Bamenda Food Market, about ten minutes into town. With this loan, L. will pay her farm rent, pay for labor to clear and weed her farm, buy four bags of fertilizer, about 14,000 CFA\u2019s (about $28\u2019s) worth of seeds, a piglet, a chicken, animal feed and huckleberry (green vegetable) seeds for planting. \r\n\r\nHaving been a farmer already and seen that she can sell her produce, L. is confident she will do well with this loan. As well, while raising her pigs and fowls, she will be able to sell the manure as fertilizer. In the end, she knows that residents in her community will buy her grown pigs and fowl. \r\n\r\nAfter the age of 6, when her father passed away, it was hard for L. to afford to go to school. Since then, she has raised her children without a partner, and has financial difficulties because of that. \r\n\r\nWith the profits from this loan she will pay for her children\u2019s school fees, feed her family, put money towards building her house and be prepared to help her family with health problems. This is L.\u2019s third loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2006. L. takes out GHAPE loans because they give training on how to use her loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

don\u2019t get anywhere standing still. That has always been my motto for life,\u201d says Jason.\r\n\r\nJason has been in the entertainment and music industry for over 15 years, but it was the current popularity of TV singing and dance competitions that inspired him to turn his passion for hip hop music and dance into his own business and an opportunity for local artists. Jason launched Bay Area Battle Tactics, a local competition for singers, dancers, and DJs that can help them gain recognition beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. Jason taught himself graphic design and created his own website to advertise the company, and he recruited friends in the entertainment industry to volunteer and get the project off the ground. \r\n\r\nWith a $6,000 loan, Jason can create and distribute flyers and posters, hold auditions, purchase DJ and sound equipment, and hire part-time employees. He hopes that his business will also help reduce inner-city gang violence and unify diverse communities by providing a creative outlet for local youth through music, song, and dance.\r\n\r\nVisit

her business, Island You a Hand, Vika hires out in-home caretakers, providing companionship for the elderly.  With her diverse and multilingual team of caretakers, which includes Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and other foreign language speakers, she is able to provide a high quality of service.  Vika founded the company in January 2009 with her own savings and a deep commitment to her work. With a background in sales, Vika approaches her business as an aggressive start-up. She has developed relationships with local assisted care facilities, and regularly gives talks at churches in the area to reach out to people directly. Vika sees an opportunity to expand into more technical medical care services, but will need to be certified by the State of California.\n\nThis loan will help Vika acquire certification and hire

27, earns a living by selling grocery inventory from her house--selling items such as cooked food and sweets for kids.

a widowed mother of two, has always loved children and believes her mission in life is to help them. For over ten years, she worked with disadvantaged children at various nonprofits before being laid off in 2003.  She began fostering children and decided to take this effort one step further by opening a daycare center in her home in California. Amato hopes that the individual care and attention each child receives at Village d\u2019Afrique will teach them great values and give them the opportunity to flourish in life. She\u2019d like to provide this opportunity to more children, but needs funds to fully convert her home into a daycare center with a higher capacity.\r\nWith a $6,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, Amato will be able to carpet the living room nap area, convert her garage into a play room, and buy art and educational supplies. Currently, Amato has three children in her bilingual French and English daycare program, but she hopes that the loan will expand her capacity to care for more children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5642.48,"image":{"id":331441,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":600,"youtube_id":"_RUWPBH5H00"},"activity":"Child

K., age 33, has been married for many years. She has been a silk weaver for 19 years, a skill she learned from her grandmother. She has three children who attend school. All of them assist her with weaving silk when they are free from their studies. \r\n\r\n<P>Mrs. K. sells her finished products to a middleman who resells them at the market in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

E. is from the village of San Simon, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 39 years old. Rosefe is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosefe owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Rosefe has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rosefe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosefe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Rosefe is requesting a new loan of 16000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Rosefe from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support education of children and for the needs of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

48, lives in Pursat province, Cambodia. She has owned a plot of land since 1999. She grows both rice and vegetable crops. She can plant her crops twice a year, in the dry season and the rainy season--a skill she learned from her grandparents. She is a widowed mother who has given birth to six children: four are single, two are married, and they all work as rice farmers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Komiljon thanks you very much for your caring for others.    <P> \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

According to Faizullo, he works very hard so that he can maintain his children. For that reason, he is always looking for a way to improve the living of his family. Currently Faizullo needs a loan of Somoni 2500 in order to purchase more cattle. He will later resell the cattle, after breeding them.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She and her husband are good parents who are blessed with four children; two are married and have already started new families, while the other two are single and attend school. \r\n<p>\r\nThe family earns their daily income by fishing in and around the Tunle Sap River and selling their catch at the local market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The five preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy four sacks of rice, two sacks of beans (which will be made into <i>beignets<\/i> and then sold), 660 coconuts, a sack of sugar, a basket of dried hibiscus flowers, 40 kg of ginger, a basket of tamarind, a box of flavorings, and a roll of plastic bags for packaging purposes.  Supplies of these essential items are gotten at the weekly fair of the grand marketplace of S\u00e9gou.  Sales are made at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, at the house, by going door-to-door in the area, and at primary schools.  Their customers are composed of men, women, and children.  \r\n\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average monthly profit of 36,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to assist with societal events (marriages, baptisms, and funerals).  Their ambition is to become wholesalers through the partnership they maintain with Soro Yiriwaso.  \r\n\r\nAt the time this photo was taken, Albertine C. was at the bedside of her child, who was mortally wounded by bandits.  We just learned that the child ultimately died.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":331677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalie                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albertine            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nana                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":116666.66,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":117343.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243079,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":58671.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678947,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":58671.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112689,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":58671.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028255,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":58671.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873589,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T13:15:24Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113921,"name":"Jamaladdin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamaladdin F. is 42 and married with three children.

They are now on their seventh solidarity loan.  All the previous loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy:  six bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, thirteen boxes of soap, 50 kg of <i>n\u2019gu\u00e9ni<\/i> (seeds of a wild plant), 3 kg of <i>magnonkiss\u00e8ni<\/i> (seeds of another wild plant), ten bottles of <i>eau de cologne<\/i> and perfumes, a sack of sugar, a basket of dried hibiscus flowers, 40 kg of ginger, a basket of tamarind, a box of flavorings, and a packet of plastic bags for packaging.

The loan Naimjon now is asking for is to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his varied crops. The loan will greatly improve Naimjon\u2019s income and his family's living standards.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Klichboy enjoys working in agriculture and, in particular, he likes vegetable production as it is easy to cultivate vegetables and the product is profitable in season, which is annual. His earnings are greater when buyers purchase the crop in large quantities and come to harvest and take it away themselves allowing Klichboy to avoid the expense of transport costs.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He lives with his parents and his four siblings in the rural Costa Rican community of Mollejones de Platanares, P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n.  Mollejones is a community located 150 kilometers south of the province of San Jos\u00e9, the capital of Costa Rica, and is 850 meters above sea level.  In this area, people grow vegetables, coffee, and also carry out activities related to raising livestock and pigs.  There also exist several projects related to organic farming and hydroponics (a technique of growing plants, without soil, in nutrient-rich water).  In addition to the agricultural pursuits of the area, there are also auto repair shops, a supermarket, small restaurants (sodas) and a furniture store.  \r\n\r\nJuan Pablo works as an officer for the State Police force; he comments that his work is very far from his home, and it is difficult for him to travel there as the roads are in disrepair and there is little access to public transportation.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Juan has decided to buy a motorcycle in order to be able to travel to work.  It will also help him save time and money.  He needs a loan of 300,000 Costa Rican colones ($550USD) to buy a motorcyle.  Having his own vehicle as his primary mode of transportation will allow him to continue to progress.\r\n\r\nJuan Pablo is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Bancruce, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan but Juan Pablo stresses that, thanks to these types of organizations and credit facilitators, he can dedicate more time to activities that are productive. \r\n\r\n<br

She is also characterized by particular courage and determination. She is always ready to serve her customers. When she gets a new shipment in, she goes around the neighborhood to let folks know. <P>\r\n\r\nIsabelle began this business in 1990, selling smoked fish, with an initial capital of US$ 75. After having acquired a solid experience, she worked hard and managed her business well, and the profit she put aside amounted to a capital of more than US$ 400 in 2004. <P>\r\n\r\nFrom 2004-2007 the currency depreciation and price hikes perturbed her business and caused it to decrease. In August 2008, Isabelle decided to join one of the groups of Hope RDC called \"Prodigy\", intending to increase her capital and find permanent financial support. She is a faithful client who has received several loans from Hope RDC and has reimbursed them on time. The loan she has received this month of June allowed her to buy salted fish and flip-flops to resell so as to increase her revenue. Presently, her personal capital stands at US$ 150. Her dream is to open a general store. <P>\r\n\r\nIsabelle is married and the mother of 7 children, whose ages vary between 2 and 20. Five of them are enrolled in school. Isabelle is proud to be a micro-entrepreneur. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She is mainly motivated by her three sons and her parents, with whom she lives. Being abandoned by her partner has caused her to go through various difficulties which she could only face with the help of her family. \r\n\r\nSince being very young she has worked in various fields, but for the last seven years she has worked selling clothing, moving about in her district market - a place that is very crowded but that also has more delinquency, which is why she always tries to take the necessary precautions. Moreover, selling in the entrance to the markets is not an easy task since she has to set up her awning very early because people generally visit the market in the morning. She sells until 3:00 in the afternoon and after that returns home to take care of her children. \r\n\r\nCarmen's wish is to buy a stall inside the market so she can stop exposing herself to the danger, have better security, and have economic stability in her business. The years that she has working in her community bank have given her the opportunity to grow economically and this fourth loan will help her to improve and provide the possibility to continue working with her companions with whom she has many projects to carry out as a group, such as organization. With the 1800 soles that she is requesting she will acquire a larger quantity of clothing merchandise for the winter season. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":331952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-09T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990735,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211837,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641362,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080802,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996941,"comment":null},{"amount":104.15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":311.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-10T01:11:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114078,"name":"Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Primer pr\u00e9stamo: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=89362&_tpos=1&_tpg=1\nSu negocio es de venta de todo tipo de bebidas entre cerveza, gaseosas  y golosina, le deja mas ganancias, no se malogran.\nLo que le gusta del Bancomunal, es que aprendi\u00f3 ahorrar y ha querer tener otros negocios.\nAlejandrina necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1600 soles, para surtir su negocio y comprar 20 cajas de cerveza,\nEl sue\u00f1o de alejandrina es que su negocio siga creciendo\n","en":"First loan: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=89362&_tpos=1&_tpg=1\r\nHer business is in the sale of all types of drinks amongst them beer, soft drinks, and sweets;

He liked the work, but the jobs were inconsistent and had long dry spells that were difficult to manage. Mark knew that he could do it better as his own boss, so in late 2008 he decided to start his company, Urban Digital.\n\nUrban Digital specializes in marketing and visual tools for builders and architect engineers. With a degree in architecture and many years of experience, Mark is an expert at producing technical images, websites, marketing kiosks and other materials that architects need. But getting started is hard, especially given the high upfront cost of all the hardware and technical software he needs to complete the projects he is pitching to clients. With a $7,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, Mark will be able to make these purchases and truly get his business up to speed. \n\nMark is saving money right now by running the business out of his home,

They are humbly living in the peaceful Barangay of Tandul, somewhere in Cabatuan, Isabela. She is thankful that her store has worked well so far because it is very important to her and her family.
