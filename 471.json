Now Aniana has decided to start selling rice, so she has applied for a loan of PHP 25,000 to buy 10 sacks of rice (at PHP 1,800 per sack), sacks of charcoal, and cases of soft drinks and liquor. She plans to develop her business into a full-fledged grocery store someday, and hopes that KIVA lenders will support her financially as she works to turn her plans and goals in life into realities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":610862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

is a businessman who successfully combines running his business and taking care of his family of three people. He has two children. Rahmon is originally from Isfara, a city in the south of Tajikistan. He started his business 15 years ago, after a desperate period of unemployment when his family didn\u2019t get enough for their most basic needs. Today, he offers his services as a woodworker. Rahmon has a perfect credit history. He has already repaid one loan from IMON International without any delinquencies. This time, Rahmon is requesting a loan of $1200 USD to purchase wood products like bold timber, plank timber for his production. We believe this loan will also be repaid promptly. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

age 45, Corazon D.

All her children finished only high school because she does not have the capacity to send them to college because of the expensive fares required to going in and out of the island where they live. Some of her children already have a family of their own. \r\n\r\nShe joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines. As a member, she makes sure that her loans are invested properly and she performs her duties and responsibilities diligently. For almost five years she has been buying and selling dried fish. Aside from the fish caught by her children, she will buy fresh fish from the fishermen and dry them. She will then pack the fish in kilos and sell them to the market and to her frequent customers. She is applying for a loan of PHP 25,000 for additional capital for her dried fish business and to finance the plan of her eldest son to put up a locally known fish trap called \"skylab\" that is made up of fish net and bamboo poles positioned in the allowed fishing area of the lake. Income generated from this business will be used to renovate their house and for the daily consumption of her children and grandchildren. She is hoping that KIVA lenders will help them in this venture.

J. is 38 years old. She lives in Koprobazar village in the north-west of Kyrgyzstan and has five school-aged children. Gulzamira worked as a milker at the local state farm and is described as a benevolent, responsible and very hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Gulzamira began to develop their business, with her husband, of stock-breeding and bought two cows using their initial capital of 20,000 KGS. Also, Gulzamira began to cultivate land with potatoes and perennial herbs. The children help their parents in these activities and take part in making the family business.  \r\n\r\nGulzamira intends to use this loan of 60,000 KGS to buy one cow and ten sheep for fattening and reselling.

This small island is situated in the middle of Laguna de Bay in the Philippines. They were not able to send their children to college. Their main source of income is fishing, in which her two sons are active. They also make barbeque sticks out of bamboo and invest in hog fattening. She is a member of Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.(ASHI), a partner MFI of KIVA since 2008. She is applying for a loan of PHP 20,000 to buy materials for the repair of their boat and to finance the assembly of a new fish cage. She is hoping to earn more profits from this investment so that she can fulfill her dream of building a better house and provide education to her only daughter.

E. is 54 years old. She lives in Emgekchil village in the north of Kyrgyzstan and has seven children. \r\nJumabubu has a higher pedagogical education, and worked as a primary school teacher at a local area for 35 years. She is characterized by her colleagues as a responsible, precise and open-hearted person. Now she is on pension and is engaged in cattle breeding.  \r\n\r\nJumabubu used her starting capital of 10,000 KGS to buy livestock for fattening and reselling. Thanks to her persistent and hard-working personality, she managed to enlarge the number of her livestock to five sheep, five goats, two cows and one horse. She sells milk to her customers at the local market and earns about 3,000 KGS monthly. With the revenues from livestock reselling, Jumabubu was able to  build up a barn and renovate her house. \r\n\r\nJumabubu plans to use this loan of 60,000 KGS to buy three calves and fifteen sheep.

V. is 35 years old and the mother of two children. In 2008, she joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.(ASHI), a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines. She is excited as she recalls all her experiences as a mother and a member of ASHI. Before joining ASHI, she remembers how hard it was to start a business, especially without having access to capital. Her prayer was granted when she became a member of the institution and started taking loans. She started earning and can regularly provide their basic needs. She is applying again for a loan of PHP 17,000 to buy additional grocery items, soft drinks and raw products for her food vending business. She wishes to expand her food vending business because she notices the increase of customers eating in her place. She plans to establish a more convenient place for her customers to eat and add more menus for them to choose from. She is hoping that KIVA lenders will support her future plans.

B. is 39 years old and the mother of three children. She has a very united family, where many cultures are combined, because Irina is Russian and her husband is Kazakh. They bring up their children in deep respect for the multicultural society of different nations in Kyrgyzstan.  \r\n\r\nIrina graduated from food industrial college and got married at the age of 21. When she gave birth to her children, she became the main householder for the family. At that time, Irina\u2019s husband worked as an engineer at the local dairy factory, but his wage was low and didn\u2019t meet all expenses. That\u2019s why Irina decided to start her business in trade and opened up a small shop near her house. Her activity started to bring in permanent profit, but unfortunately was not enough to cover expenses of her growing children. Being a very active person, Irina decided to engage in breeding cattle in the year 2000. She bought one cow and one bull calf and soon managed to multiply their number to five bull calves and one milk cow. With the revenue from this business, Irina was able to pay for the education of her elder son. \r\n\r\nIrina wants to take a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy bull calves for fattening and reselling. With the rest of the loan, she plans to expand the range of products in her shop. She hopes that this will help her increase revenue and let her open up a big shop in the future. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

All five members of the family live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. Her oldest son has recently finished high school and currently stays at home while her two younger children both attend secondary school. Her husband works as a guard at a local company. \r\n\r\nShatarmaa operates a shoe-making business in a rented space where she produces a variety of traditional boots and shoes. She has been working as a shoe-making teacher at Ugalz vocational training center since 2006. She also has started her own business. \r\n\r\nShe has been selling her products at the largest main market of Ulaanbaatar, Narantuul.

Her goal is to continue elevating her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon (or honorable) way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":609674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to

To gain access to capital she prefers ASHI to other MFIs because she is motivated by the principles of the institution. After several years of being in the program she talks about the big improvement in her life. She has been able to earn profits from her previous loans that have helped her family meet their daily expenses and children's educational expenses. \r\n<br>Now, Marilyn is applying for a loan of 45,000 PHP to finance her transportation business. She will buy ten rickshaw units at the price of 4,500 PHP per unit. Part of her business plan is to increase the number of her rickshaws to earn more income and at the same time provide more employment, especially to out-of-school youth who want to drive her rickshaws. Because of the many blessings she has received from joining the program, she also wants to share these with other people. What she often wishes is for her children to finish college and earn degrees and for her business to be stable and earning profits.

She is 36 years old. Virgie is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Virgie runs a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fruits and vegetables in the community. Virgie has operated her fruits-and-vegetables vending business for almost three years and she is earning approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) monthly.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Virgie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virgie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nVirgie is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to have additional inventory and working capital. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Virgie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

They have four children between 5 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nMarietta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marietta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 15,000 PHP, thus raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP which she intends to use to purchase more materials for her pottery making business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and do home repairs. Marietta A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She has 1 child who already has a family while the other 3 children are working and helping her out.\r\n\r\nLilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and for the needs of her family. Lilia P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It hosted a key post along the Silk Road and marked the extent of Alexander the Great's empire. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The country's civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients present viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children's education and family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

G. is a married woman who lives in Purok 6, Barangay Giligan, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She and her husband earn their living by operating two business ventures, a general store and an herbal medicine dealership. Milagros operates the general store and her husband, Papias Geromal, who is 34 years old, is an herbal medicine dealer. They have three children who are between the ages of 5 months and 14 years old. \r\n\r\nMilagros joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Milagros and her husband have been incrementally lifting their family out of poverty by the sweat of their brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $280, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more stock to sell in her general store. She also wants to use part of the money to purchase a motorcycle to use for the business. She and her husband want to earn more money in order to save up for the future education of their children. Milagros G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

N. is a 34-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: a general store, a fishing business and a transportation business. She lives in Purok Litid, Barangay Manalongon, Santa Catalina, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $230. \r\n\r\nRoberosa is now borrowing 13,000 PHP so that she can do some repairs and maintenance on her motorcycle as well as buy stock to sell in her general store. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 19,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Roberosa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ulugbek is 44 years-old and a citizen of Kyrgyz's southern city, Osh. He graduated from industrial college and worked as a mechanical engineer at a brick factory. But the money which Ulugbek earned working  around the clock, didn\u2019t cover the needs of his family of three children. In 1994, with the wholehearted support of his wife, who worked as a teacher at the local school, Ulugbek decided to start his business selling office supplies. Using their money, which they put away for a rainy day, this couple began to sell office suppliers and bags at the local market. Due to strong efforts and hard work, Ulugbek managed to buy a house and a used car for his family. His conscientious attitude to work allowed him to gain a reputation of being a responsible businessman. \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Ulugbek lost his business. His sales shop at the market was robbed and looted. But Ulugbek didn\u2019t give up and decided to resume his lost business and continue his activities.

Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children and fulfill her plans of buying a photocopying machine. \r\n\r\nGilda A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

M. is a married woman who lives in Purok Centro, Bgy.4, Roxas, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: canteen and farming businesses. Her husband Jose M., who is 62 years old, works as a cook in their canteen to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 18 to 32 years old.\r\n\r\n Juliet joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juliet has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 60,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to pay for more raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future to get into the pig-raising business. \r\n\r\nJuliet M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in Prk.

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Sonny C., who is 52 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children, who are 19 to 26 years old and all have their own families. \r\n\r\nLolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to have something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus lifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and use it as additional capital for the business. Lolita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Molmol graduated from medical college as a nurse and devoted 15 years of practical experience to helping her patients to overcome their diseases. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, when Molmol was expecting a baby, her husband lost his job. Those times became a period of living in the pinch of poverty for her family. But Molmol didn\u2019t give up and decided to start her own business reselling linens, fabrics and tablecloths, using her initial capital of 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nIn spite of many the highs and lows in her activity, Molmol managed to broaden her business by purchasing two small shops and achieved success. These activities led her to obtain loans from \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d, which were repaid without any delays. Molmol\u2019s husband, who was infected by her enthusiasm, became the main helper and strong supporter in the business. \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by deposed the political regime broke out in Osh, Molmol lost her business. Her shops were robbed and looted. However, Molmol  is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this reason, Molmol is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase home products for resale at the local market. With the revenue from this loan, Molmol plans to give a good education to her daughter, because she believes that educated youth can move their motherland forward. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She tells us that some time ago she began to sell sweetcorn to her acquaintances and relatives. Later she was able to acquire a cart to sell her product, since her residenc is close to the central market in the city of Toluca. Little by little her business grew. With the savings she was able to amass over a long time she decided to start a business with her family and thus began the client's sucess story. Despite having a \"harelip\" and being a victim of teasing in her community, she has been able to get ahead. With her family's help, her greatest dream has always been for her youngest son, Juan Pablo, who is in elementary school, to be an attorney. With that achievement all of her hard work and sacrifice will have been worth it. The loans that the institution has given her have been to develop her business and with it obtain a better quality of life for her and her family. With the next loans she receives she wants to move her business to a different place and with it obtain more profit.
