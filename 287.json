She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Niavelle joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

This loan will be her third from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Since she has very little capital, she joined Alalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc. (ASKI), a microfinance organization, and has applied for a loan of P 5,000.00 to buy additional items for her business.

C. is from the village of Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 68 years old. Gerarda is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Gerarda sells seafood, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Gerarda has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gerarda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gerarda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC that she used to expand her business. Gerarda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP that she will use to buy more fish to sell. This will be Gerarda's third loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":403924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional fish to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

She started her business in 2003 with the help of her supportive aunt, and now she owns her own stall at the market and is getting more customers every day. \r\n\r\nThis successful business has allowed Enkhtuya to buy her own ger where she and her daughter can live comfortably.  She lost both of her parents when she was a young child, and because of that, she wants her daughter to have everything that she never had.  This is why Enkhtuya works hard every day and is making the most out of her clothing business. She would like to learn how to drive and purchase a car so that she can pick up items for her business instead of having to rely on delivery drivers. \r\n\r\nEnkhtuya is requesting a loan of 1,700,000 tugtug (~1200 USD) to purchase clothing, such as socks and jeans from China.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":404039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

Vevencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Vevencia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

This loan will be the second loan taken out by Venancia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

E. is from the village of Bocator Tangub City.

To make a living, Sopia owns & operates an \"alimango\" (mud crab) fishing business selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community. Sopia has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sopia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sopia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell and to expand the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Sopia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units with offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Firida thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":404167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more clothes in bulk  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T09:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Firida  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868375,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757571,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146665,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984810,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015483,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740489,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-18T06:56:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":143375,"name":"Sarith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Sarith R., age 45 and his wife, Leangse Neng, age 43, were married in 1990 and have three children: one son and two daughters.

from Tanzania! This is 53-year-old Joyce K. from Mbozi  She is married and has five children between the ages of 12 and 24. Joyce has been running a crops business since 2005. She purchases and sells crops. She works at her business for 9-12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Joyce currently earns about $100 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk. In the future, she plans to improve the quality and range of the crops she sells. Joyce thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.

J., 33, is in the bicycle rental business.  She hails from Bagong Silang, Caloocan City.  Her husband, Bonifacio, age 36, works at a nearby factory.  They have two children who both attend a pre-school.\r\n\r\nJennifer rents out bicycles to customers, both adults and children.  She has been in this business for four years.  She sometimes has trouble when a customer runs away with a bicycle or returns a broken bicycle to her shop. However, she still likes her work very much because she gets to know a lot of people from different walks of life.  She earns close to $93 a month in net income.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2007.  Now on her 7th loan cycle, Jennifer needs a loan of P14,000 for the continuity of her business.  She would buy spare parts for the repairs of her bicycles.   She is also helping her husband save for the renovation of their house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":403963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase spare parts for her rental bicycles.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

is a 35 year old woman who lives in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, with her husband. Samar has been working as a hairdresser for ten years. Samar doesn\u2019t own a hairdressing salon and doesn\u2019t work from her house, rather she goes to her clients. This means she works only when she has clients. Samar requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase new tools, as well as to pay for her children\u2019s school tuition. This is her second cycle and she has always paid on time.\r\n<p>\r\nSamar's work is special because she knows how to treat her clients well and is aware of new hairstyles.

She works primarily as a dairy cow farmer and also raises crops.  \r\n<p>\r\nLilian began working about 8 years ago, when she had only two cows and primarily grew corn.  She is a very hard and tireless worker, and she now has many cows, pigs, turkeys, chickens, in addition to several crops that she grows.  \r\n<p>\r\nLilian's family lives with her parents in the town of Mallco Rancho, of Quillacollo Province, which is just outside of the city of Cochabamba.  Lilian's husband has been working in Spain for nearly three years, so she has been running the farm on her own.  She hopes that he returns home soon so they can begin work building a home on a plot of land that she inherited from her father.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan from Kiva's partner CIDRE, she plans to purchase fodder for her livestock, such as soy husks and alfalfa.  She believes the loan will help to increase her earnings buy providing her cows with more food, so that they will in turn produce more milk.

She assures us that it is going very well and the dishes most fancied by the tourists are: chicken soup, empanadas, suero blanco (whey from milk), bolones (banana\/egg pastry), seco de gallina criolla (a chicken dish with a traditional sauce), etc.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from the Foundation ESPOIR she will increase her business by buying other products to prepare other traditional dishes like fish and shrimp, and a bar which will offer soft drinks, mineral water, and beer.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":401695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Buy products to add other traditional dishes and start a bar with soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T15:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felinda Caridad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947530,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947531,"comment":null},{"amount":235.62,"local_amount":230.38,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":235.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789388,"comment":null},{"amount":101.88,"local_amount":99.62,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":101.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679823,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679824,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074404,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074405,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-15T08:44:59Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":143510,"name":"Vitaliy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vitaliy is married with two adult children.

This city is located in the Inter-Andean valley in the southern Ecuadorian jungle.  It is also considered to be the third most important city in Ecuador.  In its historical center we are able to enjoy a conglomerate of cultural heritage for national tourists as well as for foreigners.  The people are very warm and courteous.  On this occasion the loan representative, Lupe Pozo, joined us and is seated in the middle of the four members who are seated at the desk.  She has a white shirt and glasses.\r\n\r\nViviana Amparito A. A. is a member of the Mujeres Divinas Communal Bank.  She lives in the outskirts of the city of Cuenca.  She is 32 and in a common law marriage.  She maintains a good relationship with her husband.  They have two small children who are three and seven.  Her husband works in construction, which allows him to contribute to the household expenses.  They do not yet have their own house, so they live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nViviana has a business selling coffee with \u201chumitas\u201d (corn paste tamales), and empanadas with corn.  She also sells lunches on Saturdays.  She has been doing this work for a long time.  A year ago she started her business of selling Yanbal products.  She tells us that it is going very well.  Her biggest difficulty is the default of some customers.  The advantage is the prizes for meeting her quota.  Viviana and the other members of the communal bank have created a companionable and good working atmosphere.  This is her second loan cycle with the foundation.  The loans she has received have been invested in her Yanbal business.  The new loan from the institution is to buy more women\u2019s, men\u2019s, and children\u2019s Yanbal products to offer more and better products to her customers.  Her greatest dream is to build her own house.\r\n\r\nCarmen Brecilda A. I\u00f1iguez lives in the center of the city of Cuenca, a place filled with history and tradition.

Her oldest child is married and does not live with her.  The  two younger children work and contribute a little money towards the household expenses.  She lives in a rented house.  She will soon be alone because her children are planning to get married.\r\n\r\nCarmen works as a beauty consultant with the Yanbell line.  She has been doing this for 14 years.  She tells us that it is going very well for her.  She has come to have her own customers and to hold one of the first places in sales, which has given her a privileged place in this business.  She says that this work requires a lot of patience and dedication because there are down times like when classes resume.\r\n\r\nThis is her third cycle working with loans from the foundation.  She tells us that she has used the loans to buy Yanbal products.  She will use the new loan from the ESPOIR Foundation to buy other lines of cosmetics lik E\u2019sika.

Her story is representative both of the members of her group as well as Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated from Haiti to the DR) clients more generally. Her group is based in Santiago, the second largest town in the DR, which is a region known for agricultural production and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable at best. Here she makes her home in a simple structure of concrete walls, a tin roof and a dirt floor with her husband and two children.\n\nMiguelina has just completed her first loan cycle with Esperanza and she is excited to take out her second loan. With this loan she plans to further invest in her business selling candles in her neighborhood. She has identified a market for candles in her neighborhood as a result of the frequent, extended blackouts common in her area. She believes that this business will provide a steady income and improve her quality of life and the lives of her children. She thanks you all for your support.

She started to work when she was 8 years old at home taking care of elderly and sick people, and she did that until she had two children of her own to look after.

Most of the members are involved in different commercial activities such as selling breakfast foods, clothing, handicrafts or CDs, or providing public transport for passengers.  Although competition within the commercial sector is always present, over the years the members have learned to hold their own by selling good quality products at low prices, or by diversifying their merchandise so they can have a more varied stock; this has enabled them to generate more income for supporting their families.  Nevertheless, the members always need to increase their working capital in order for their businesses to grow, since their families\u2019 needs are increasing over the years.  The members need economic assistance so that they can increase their merchandise and purchase tools and spare parts, and thus improve their daily income.

He has four children.  All of them asked to be in the photo with the exception of his oldest daughter; she was embarrassed.  Once Jose Luis became a widower he moved to live in a house that was given to him by his ex in-laws.  This is because two of his children are from his first marriage.  When his wife was alive she managed a place where she sold food.  It was set up in his own home.  Now, given the circumstances, Jose Luis saw that it would be convenient to set up a bar in a strategic area of the city.\r\n\r\nJose Luis currently lives with Magali.  They have two children.  Jose Luis is very hard-working, and they are very hopeful that his new business will be successful.  The good thing is that there is no competition nearby, and there are lots of shops and stores that are close.

The fact that they are in their second loan cycle speaks to their sense of reponsibility and punctuality in making their loan payments.  The members, who all live in the same area, are involved in different business activities, including the sale of electrical appliances, cosmetics, groceries and food.  They sell in a neighborhood where there is not much competition in their respective lines of business.  For this reason, their sales frequently generate daily income for the members. The requested loan is intended for investment in the economic and business activities that pay for the group's daily household expenses.  In the future, they hope to increase their earnings and to improve even further the quality of life of their families, providing them with a better education and the possibility of their children attending university. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kara Gibson, Kiva

He will use the loan to buy fishing equipement to use. Currently, he is repairing an old net but, through the small loan, he will be able to buy a new one. He will also use some of the loan to buy fish from other fishermen to resell. Fishing is a very good business. If his loan is approved, he could start immediately selling fish to the nearby towns and villages.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":404042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

M., a 54-year-old single mother of one adult-aged child, is from the village of Poblacion, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental.  To make a living, Clarita owns and operates a specialized \"sari-sari\" retail store whose main source of income comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Clarita has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month. <p> \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Clarita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC that was used to purchase additional products to sell, Clarita is now requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her fourth from GDMPC, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
