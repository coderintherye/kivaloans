For example, in September they sell back-to-school supplies to families. When it is time to begin planting a new crop, they sell fertilizer to farmers, and during the Christmas season, they sell decorations. Gladys and her husband sell the majority of their products in \u201cferias,\u201d or large, open-air markets in the countryside. Sometimes they must travel many hours outside of Ayacucho.  <P>\r\n\r\nGladys began with just a small supply of \u201cabarrotes,\u201d which is the name given to the general supply of a variety of bulk food products. These Gladys continues to sell year round. This was twelve years ago, and today Gladys is the owner of a thriving business that has branched out into several different markets. It is a dynamic way to do business, however, Gladys says it is the best way to earn the highest returns. Eventually, Gladys would like to enter the construction market, selling different types of materials to a variety of companies.<P>\r\n\r\nWithin her village bank, Gladys says she feels like she has a second family. She says it is an incredible resource for women, and the savings aspect has helped her in constructing her very own house where she and her two children, ages ten and two, live. It has also helped her save enough money to buy a van that she and her family are able to use to take their large amounts of goods for sale to the \"ferias\". Gladys is asking for a $400 loan, with which she will be able to buy a large supply of fertilizer to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":77685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"o buy a large supply of fertilizer for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-10-23T20:35:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-07T01:30:18Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T10:28:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":301.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93239,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-01-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":301.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111273,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":301.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130531,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":301.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152219,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-24T00:30:18Z","paid_date":"2008-03-07T10:07:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":22118,"name":"Kossi Mawutowou","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr. Kossi Mawutowou B., 34 years old, was born in Kuma Adam\u00e9 and lives in Alinka.

Fortunata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fel\u00edcitas Fortunata A. M. is part of a village bank called \u201cAmaquella,\u201d which is Quechua (native language) for \u201cDon\u2019t be lazy.\u201d\r\n\r\n<p>Fel\u00edcitas has a soft spot in her heart for children which is immediately obvious as upon entering her \u201cbodega,\u201d or small grocery store. Amidst the daily necessities every grocery store provides--staple foods, soda, cleaners, utensils--Fel\u00edcitas has dedicated an entire wall to children\u2019s toys. There are stuffed animals, dolls, games, costumes, and anything else a small child\u2019s heart desires. Fel\u00edcitas says the neighborhood children always stop by for candy or for a birthday present on their way to a \u201ccumplea\u00f1os,\u201d or birthday. \r\n\r\n<p>For four years, Fel\u00edcitas has owned and maintained her grocery store in a pleasant neighborhood just outside of the city center of Ayacucho, Peru. Years before, and for the majority of her professional life, Fel\u00edcitas rented a store in downtown Ayacucho, where she sold children\u2019s clothing. Though she greatly enjoyed her work selling clothing, it was very expensive to rent space in the city, and Fel\u00edcitas preferred to buy her own place to run her own, more independent business. Today, this is exactly what she does. After switching from selling clothing to groceries, a more practical market in her current neighborhood, Fel\u00edcitas now spends every single day behind the store counter. She arrives at 5:00 a.m. each morning to begin selling fresh bread for breakfast and doesn\u2019t leave until 9 p.m. that evening. It is tiring, she admits, but also very rewarding, and she does get the occasional break when one of her six grown children stop by to take over the counter from time to time. \r\n\r\n<p>Within her village bank, Fel\u00edcitas is extremely happy.

When Yolanda was a student at the university, she began to support herself through selling honey. Today, 28 years later, she is still selling honey by the kilo. Every weekend she drives to the nearby town of Huanta to buy her supply. In addition to selling honey, for the past 10 years Yolanda has been selling jewelry from her home. Three times each year she drives to Lima to buy beautiful earrings, bracelets, rings, necklaces, and broaches. She sells these to professionals, neighbors, friends, and also to brides preparing for weddings. But her business ventures aren\u2019t limited to honey and jewelry.<p>\r\n\r\nShe studied nursing at the university in Ayacucho and now works at the nearby technological institute supervising nursing students as they complete their practices. Although this is a full-time job, Yolanda is a single mother and it does not sufficiently provide for Yolanda\u2019s two children, ages nine and six. In order to supplement her income and provide for her family\u2019s needs, Yolanda has followed in the footsteps of her mother as an entrepreneur. In addition to these three commitments, Yolanda has just recently begun selling cookware through an international company to her friends and family. She says she is always looking for a new market and a new way to support her family.\r\n\r\nOne day, Yolanda hopes to open her own jewelry shop. It is very important to her that she is able to be independent in her businesses, and her village bank is helping her toward this goal. She appreciates her village bank because it has helped her establish her businesses with economic security.

Ainsi donc, elle voudrait augmenter son \u00e9talage et construire un kiosque pour mieux se faire conna\u00eetre dans sa zone. Ceci va lui permettre d\u2019am\u00e9liorer son revenu pour mieux s\u2019occuper de ses enfants qu\u2019elle aime tant. Car elle tient beaucoup \u00e0 leur avenir surtout \u00e0 leurs \u00e9tudes parce que son analphab\u00e9tisation ne la profite pas. Pour r\u00e9aliser ce projet, elle sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $700."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":77702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"building a

She also works every day to ensure that the people who depend on her are satisfied. She has always been characterized by her immense thirst for knowledge and it is thanks to this that in her younger years she decided to study sociology. She always had a desire to observe and help others in building a better society; it is because of this that she chose the same course of study as her husband. A few years later, when her husband retired, they received a pension for his years of service. After analyzing their community, they saw a demand and decided to open a small business to continue to meet their needs successfully and quickly. Rosa began work on a grain mill and her husband on a plant producing herbs. Through their tireless efforts they have been able to provide for education and wellbeing of their daughters and hope to continue with their youngest daughter who is 14. Now she would like to begin and increase different services in her mill to be able to continue offering excellent service to the local families who depend on her, besides the usual discounts and promotions, with the hope that they too might benefit from the final sale of their products.

<p>\r\n\r\nGladys is a dedicated woman that works hard every day and devotes all of her energy to offering excellent Chinese food to the diners that visit her small restaurant every day. This venture began seven years ago, selling from a small cart. It was made possible by the help and company of her beloved husband and thanks to a loan from her father-in-law. After three years of success, Gladys and her husband decided to establish their business in a rented shop where they have been for nearly four years. They have continued to put incredible effort into their business and have been able to build their clientele little by little and create more earnings to support their small children. Their goals are big and they dream of opening other restaurants. They have committed to continue working diligently to achieve this goal. However, right now a more urgent matter is that her husband is in poor health and needs an expensive medical procedure. Gladys will continue working and this is why they are asking for a loan of $350 to improve the facilities of their location. Don't miss this valuable opportunity to work with Gladys. Helping her will help her whole family!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":77728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Starting up a small Chinese restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-10-29T09:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-12T17:07:52Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2007-12-12T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108642,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting)"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-01-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":114512,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-02-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134089,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-03-12T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":156488,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180860,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":157.14,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":165.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208441,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-29T16:07:52Z","paid_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":22145,"name":"Seidou","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"S\u00e9idou S., age 44, was born in Lom\u00e9 and resides in Togbl\u00e9.

From a young age she has been involved in sales, and for the last 20 years she has sold fodder (animal feed) and alfalfa for farm animals such as Guinea pigs and rabbits, among others.  She does this job together with her husband, working as a team. In the beginning, she worked as a reseller, purchasing lots of alfalfa and reselling them in the local market. Thanks to her enthusiasm and the advice of some friends, she was able to obtain an alfalfa field so that she could grow her own product. Her business has now grown in spite of the fact that in some respects the business does not offer the same profitability that it once did. Even so, Lourdes continues to work, as she has other goals that she wishes to attain for the good of her family. She would like to produce more alfalfa in order to increase sales.

She is in this business, because daily living needs have increased, and also Ni Ketut Parti saw a great opportunity in this business, since before the people around her sold their cocoa products to an out of town business person who came to their village. However after Ni Ketut Parti started the business, people around her sold the cocoa products to her. Although initial capital was not big, that is Rp600,000 (about US$66), but because of her persistent, Ni Ketut Parti could have a profit of Rp100,000 (about $11) for 3 days. This gave her initiative to run the business, however because of capital limitations, the business could not expand as fast, while her 2 children already need high expenses for their education, and almost all of her work were used to pay for their education expenses. Her self confidence increased after Dinari gave business capital, that would be used to increase sales capital, so that results would increase. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNi Ketut Parti sudah menjalani usaha jual beli hasil produksi cokelat ( kakao ) selama 7 tahun di rumahnya yang sederhana. Usaha ini digelutinya karena kebutuhan hidup yang semakin meningkat dan juga karena Ni Ketut Parti melihat adanya peluang yang besar dalam usaha ini karena sebelumnya masyarakat di sekitarnya biasanya menjual produk cokelatnya kepada pedagang dari luar yang datang ke desa mereka. Namun setelah Ni Ketut Parti memulai usahanya, masyarakat di sekitarnya mulai menjual produk cokelat mereka kepadanya. Walaupun modal awal usahanya tidak besar yaitu hanya Rp. 600.000,- namun karena keuletannya Ni Ketut Parti bisa mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 100.000,- dari usahanya ini dalam waktu 3 hari. Hal ini membuatnya semakin bersemangat menjalankan usahanya, namun karena keterbatasan modal, usahanya tidak bisa berkembang dengan cepat, sedangkan 2 orang anaknya sudah mulai membutuhkan biaya yang besar untuk pendidikan mereka dan hampir semua hasil dari usahanya dipakai untuk biaya sekolah anak-anaknya. Kepercayaan dirinya semakin bertambah setelah DINARI memberinya pinjaman modal usaha  yang selanjutnya akan dipakainya untuk menambah modal penjualan sehingga hasilnya juga semakin bertambah."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":77926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To add

Since January 2006, prices have doubled and Gulchar applied for a loan of $600 from Normicro to purchase two calves for meat production and expanded her business.

Especially after working with Dinari Foundation, and assistance in animal business was done by a veterinarian. Since she already have a mother pig and 6 piglets, loan would be used to buy wheat shell clippings for several months pig's feed, and repairs of the stalls. Cleaning the stall and feeding are done 2X\/day, with objectives that mother pig and her 6 piglets are always healthy. Like always the case, Ni Ketut Suandi sells her 6 piglets for barbecue piglets at the age of 3 months. Feed expenses could reach Rp300,000 (about US$33). Total sales over 3 months could reach Rp1,000,000 (about $110), with a nett profit of Rp700,000 (about $77). This profit is useful to pay for family daily expense, and a teenage child.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNyoman Suardana, suami dari Ni Ketut Suandi, sangat mendukung usaha ternak babi yang ditekuninya. Apalagi setelah bergabung dengan Yayasan DINARI dan mendapat pembinaan - pembinaan mengenai usaha ternaknya yang dilakukan oleh Dokter hewan. Karena sudah mempunyai Induk babi dan anaknya 6 ekor, dana bantuan dipergunakan untuk membeli dedak gandum untuk persediaan pakan babinya beberapa bulan dan untuk perbaikan kandangnya . Pembersihan kandang dan pemberian pakan dilakukan sehari dua kali dengan tujuan induk dan ke enam bibitnya selalu  sehat. Seperti biasa Ni Ketut Suandi menjual ke enam bibit babinya untuk babi guling yaitu pada umur tiga bulan. Pengeluaran untuk biaya pakan mencapai Rp. 300.000,-. Total penjualan yang didapat selama tiga bulan  mencapai Rp.1.000.000,- dengan kuntungan bersih Rp.700.000,-.Keuntungan ini sangat bermanfaat untuk mencukupi keperluan hidup sehari-hari dalam

Since January 2006, prices have doubled and Vagif has applied for a loan of $600 from Normicro to purchase five sheep for meat production and expanded his business, increasing his income considerably.

She sells the sheep in the local market, buys other lambs, and spends the rest of her profits on the necessities of life for her family. The business is very interesting but sometimes demands more funding than she has available. Her husband helps her in this work. In 2004 Hargiz borrowed $500 from Normicro and expanded her business.

Married and father of two children, he is a trained carpenter and now has his own shop. He has acquired considerable experience which brings in lots of customers. However, Mr. A. has difficulty exercising his trade because he does not have enough modern tools. The tools he has are old and worn, which makes his work slow and difficult. For this reason, he is asking for a loan of US$ 400 to purchase better tools.

He is married and has three adult children. He lives in Kayole, an informal settlement within Nairobi, where he also runs his medical clinic. Apart from his family, he takes care of two children orphaned by HIV\/AIDS.<P>\r\n\r\nDr. M. began a clinic back in his rural home in 1996 using some of his own savings amounting to about Ksh. 70,000 (USD 1000), that he had put aside when he was still employed by the Kenyan government. By 1998, the clinic's business had grown tremendously, so that he had moved locations thrice, in order to accommodate the immense need for medical services. <P>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in 1998, he encountered several difficulties when the landlord where his business was located increased the rent to four times higher; the rent shot from about US$ 570 to US$ 1715. He therefore found that due to this steep increase in overhead, he could no longer manage to pay the workers he had employed, let alone continue with the operations of the clinic. Apart from this, his clinic also suffered tremendously due to non-payment of medical bills, i.e., many patients he had admitted failed to remit payments. To further compound the problem, many of these patients were either relatives or neighbours from his home area, making it more difficult for him to reclaim payments, since culturally, it would seem very insensitive of him. By the year 2001, he had incurred a working loss of Ksh. 1.5 million, (US$ 21,430). This amount has not been paid to date. <P>\r\n\t\r\nIn addition to these problems, he encountered another issue when he traveled to attend a seminar and was away for three months. Upon his return, he found that his staff had stolen and sold off most of the medical equipment he had acquired, and the clinic had actually been run down.  This was a very difficult experience for him, therefore he decided to close what was remaining of the clinic, and he carried away the little furniture that was left. It is with this furniture that he decided to start off a small clinic within Kayole, an informal settlement within Nairobi. <P>\r\n\r\nThe Exodus clinic is located in the Kayole area of Nairobi, in the middle of a low-income group of residents. The clinic is formally registered with the Ministry of Health in Kenya. Most of the patients that Dr. M. attends to are mothers and children, together with HIV\/AIDS patients. His aim of setting up the clinic was to reach the less privileged in Kenyan society, by providing medical service that is affordable for them. <P>\r\n\r\nDr. M. now intends to set apart a child welfare clinic within his premises, from where he will be in a better position to provide services related to the growth and well-being of children ages five years and below, from the Kayole area. From here he intends to provide vaccinations and health education for the parents, and he will also include family planning services. As an extension, he intends to provide home-based care, that is, door-to-door vaccination services, and generally attempt to raise the awareness of the community concerning the importance of vaccination for children. <P>\r\n\r\nDr. M. is therefore requesting a loan amounting to US$ 950 with which he will be able to partition off a part of the treatment room, in order to create space for the child welfare clinic. The loan will also enable him to purchase furniture for his clinic, acquire an assortment of medical drugs, a scale for babies, surgical forceps and scissors. He will also purchase a small television set that will keep the children busy as they wait to receive treatment.  He intends to repay the loan within a period of 12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":78448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical Clinic","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase

He is a very active young man who finished secondary school last year with a grade point average of B+.  After finishing school, Stephen decided not to be idle and hanging out with the wrong company.  He was worried that without a job he would be influenced towards bad behavior, such as bhang smoking and drinking.  Stephen says these activities are common to young men who are idle, due to lack of employment.  Stephen reasoned with his mother and she was very happy that he showed interest in joining in her business.<P>\r\n\r\nStephen\u2019s mother has a big stall in Kitengela, where she does tailoring.  She decided to partition off a section of her stall, where Stephen started selling school uniforms on her behalf.  After a probationary period of eight months, his mother noticed that Stephen was a very good salesman and that he interacted with the customers well.  His mother gave him a loan of Ksh 40,000 (US$ 570) so that he could purchase tailoring accessories and sell them in his section of their stall.  He sold the entire inventory within one month and his mother was very impressed, especially when he immediately repaid half of the loan (Ksh 20,000).  Stephen\u2019s mother saw his determination and told him not to repay the outstanding balance of his loan, but rather to increase his stock for the business.  This activity was all in August 2007, and since then his business has grown tremendously. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the blessings of his mother, Ndumi Mutua, who has also benefited from a Kiva loan, Stephen would like Kiva to help him become a shining example to his fellow young men in Kitengela.  He is therefore requesting a loan of US$ 750.  With this loan Stephen will be able to purchase hooks, canvas, threads, materials for uniforms, buttons, and linings.

She was unable to continue her studies after the BEPC due to her parents' poverty, which led her to marry very early on. She has two (02) children. Her husband's job, a drink seller, has slowed down considerably, which makes things more difficult for the household. Very quickly, she started selling a maize paste called \"Ablo\" in the language Ewe. Her modest financial means are insufficient to purchase maize, wood, and sugar regularly. Thus, she is asking for a loan of $400 to be able to stock maize, wood, and sugar. This loan will allow her to strengthen her purchasing and selling power, and her income will increase to let her provide for the needs of her family and the education of her children. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mme Q.

However, luck was on her side, and in the year 2005, Anne teamed up with her cousin Fridah Wanjiku, who is also requesting a loan from Kiva, and together, they rented a stall and agreed to share the rent.  Anne deals in the sale of shoes and an assortment of other items, while her cousin deals in the sale of clothes, hence their businesses are complementary.  During the holiday seasons like the upcoming month of December, the demand for clothes and shoes is always high because this is when many people buy such things as gifts for their families, both in urban and rural places.<P>\r\n\r\nAnne\u2019s business has been growing because of the high population in her area, and she finds that she always runs out of stock due to the high demand for the items in her stall.  She now needs to purchase a stock of men\u2019s shoes, ladies\u2019 shoes, children\u2019s shoes, plastic items, cutlery, and also bedcovers. Anne is therefore requesting a loan of USD 750, with which to increase her inventory.  With an increase in her stock, she will be able to increase her profit, resulting in more income.  She also intends to employ an additional person to help her around the boutique. The repayment period for her loan will be 10 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":78501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase stock of assorted shoes, assorted plastic items, cutlery and bedcovers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mlolongo settlement","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-11-20T13:35:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T17:04:03Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2008-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:18:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108110,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127991,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149019,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173310,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-05-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200512,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-06-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227668,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-07-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256764,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-08-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285534,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-09-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315714,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2008-10-04T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-05T07:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347386,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T17:04:03Z","paid_date":"2008-10-05T07:04:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":22437,"name":"Fofon\u00e8 Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr. K.

is a classy lady. She is 46, married and cares for four orphans. She owns the Maria Fashions Design, a tailoring business. She has been in business for 15 years and has been a member of her lending group for five years. Her shop is filled with her creations.\r\n \r\nWith her loan, she will purchase another sewing machine and more material. She currently owns a Butterfly, a Swan, and a Victoria sewing machine, all pedal-powered. \r\n\r\nShe needs another sewing machine because she has just started a school for young girls where they can learn the trade. This is very important because a lot of young girls have to drop out of school to take care of ailing parents and siblings.

Soedjodo K. is a master carpenter in Gbadago, Togo. Born on Nov. 28, 1980 in Vogan, Togo, he is married and father of one child. After his primary schooling, he was not able to remain in school because of his parents' poverty, and this pushed him to pursue an apprenticeship. He has now been working in his trade for five years. An upstanding and creative man and good at managing his business, he would like to produce furniture of excellent quality for sale. For that reason, he is requesting a loan of US$ 1000 so that he can purchase wood, machines for his workshop (lathe, plane, table saw, etc.)  which will allow him to increase his income and better support his family since his wife does not work outside the home and thus has no income to add to his. <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<p><\/B>Mr K.

and father of one child, Mr. Yao K. is a master metal worker in Gbadago. He was born on July 21, 1974 in Kpalim\u00e9 and is responsible for two dependents besides his immediate family. Born into a very poor family, he had to leave school after 6th grade and decided to begin an apprenticeship. After about 8 years he became a master at his trade and tried his best to figure out how to get a workshop. Since he has not managed to find a way for his wife to engage in retail business, he is the sole breadwinner for his family. He encounters many difficulties in his work, such as lack of the necessary machines, no way to fix up his workshop, and even lack of metal to work with. These problems have made him decide to ask for a loan of US$ 400 for his business.

to the fact that her husband was not earning sufficient amount of money to support her and their children, in August 1992, Rosa M. started selling ceramics for a lady where she was paid on commission. When she realized that this was a good business, she decided to work independently and start her own business selling beauty products such as Avon, Fuller and Jafra. Later, she also started to sell jewelry and, currently, she is also selling clothing. She is fortunate that she is able to sell such a variety of articles due to the demand from her clients. <p>\r\nAt the moment, she needs a larger supply of merchandise such as clothes and jewelry for the winter season to offer to her clients.

high-quality. She began her business seven years ago, motivated by one of her aunts who inspired her to study cutting and sewing and gave her confidence that she would be good at it.  Lucrecia is a native of Arequipa who moved to Sicaya when she got married, and now lives in her husband\u2019s parents\u2019 house.  She is very satisfied with her work because it allows her to care for her little daughter. Through recommendations, she has been able to earn contracts with educational institutes for sporting uniforms, and this allows her to pay for her daily home expenses.

She\u2019s sure that the great love she feels for them will keep up her efforts to succeed her work, selling alfalfa.  Twenty years ago, ever since she was young, she began her long journey by working for others cutting alfalfa in other fields. Later on, a woman watching her labor encouraged her to purchase a large lot of alfalfa so she could begin her business without intermediaries.  She was successful in this first venture, and this gave her more confidence to continue. Now married with five children, she has managed to integrate her family such that they work together without problems or delay. Throughout her journey, she has faced difficulties, but Roc\u00edo and her husband have overcome them in spite of her delicate health situation, and it has never impeded her in sustaining her family. Her spouse helps by raising rabbits.  Like any large family, they have large dreams of improving their quality of life and providing education to all such that they can become successful professionals in the future.
