P. lives in Tecpatan, Chiapas, Mexico. She is married with three children. Seventeen-year-old Hugo is in the sixth semester of his \"bachillerato\" (an academic high school program). Franklin, age 14, is also in high school. Karla Yadira is only 12 years old; she is a Grade 6 elementary school student. \r\n\r\nMaria repairs cars in a garage. She wants a loan so that she can upgrade her shop, which will allow her to provide better service. Maria has had this business for seven years, and says that things are going well. Working as a mechanic has allowed her to care for her children even though her husband abandoned them. \r\n\r\nMaria's father inspired her by teaching her how to repair vehicles. After her husband left her, she started repairing cars once again. Her work has allowed her to keep her household running and provide an education for her children. \r\n\r\nMore than anything, Maria wants to keep working so that her children can continue their education. If she can do this, even her future grandchildren will be better off. \r\n\r\nThe three other members of this group are Mrs. Maria J. S., Mrs. Tomasa S. Pomentel and Mrs. Rosa de Carmen G. Pereza.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

L. is from the village of Sto. Ni\u00f1o. She is 39 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Margarita owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fruits in the local community. Margarita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Margarita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Margarita is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fruits to sell. This loan will be Margarita's first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishepeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":766231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

But in 2001, after a rich harvest of garlic and potatoes, Ainagul undertook a decision, which became a turning point in the further development of her life as a business lady. Ainagul invested all generated revenue in the purchase of young livestock, which amounted to 5,000 soms. The whole family made small contributions to the family business, however, currently the youngest nineteen-year-old son shows a significant help. \r\n\r\nAinagul\u2019s husband is an experienced construction worker, but he believes that business is a major and stable source of income in a current and future family budget. Ainagul gets 7-8 liters of milk every morning and provides local residents with milk products every morning. Ten years of running this business have ensured Ainagul and her family confidence in tomorrow\u2019s stability and steadiness. A monthly income of 3,000 soms allows her to save. \r\n\r\nRecently the savings were used for finishing up the construction of the house where she resides.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beishekan A., 60, is the leader of this group. During one of the evening conversations at the family table, after a hard workday in the field, Beishekan and her husband, a tractor driver, were thinking about government regulations in the country\u2019s agriculture that would certainly affect their family, too. It was the year 1996, a period when new independent countries, including Kyrgyzstan, were privatizing land, which used to be collective farms during the Soviet Union. \r\n\r\nBeishekan saw advantages like having an opportunity to manage the business on her own behalf without participation of the government. But there were also risks of facing thorough competition and lack of experience in supplying the products. For the following fifteen years Beishekan has been running a dairy business, while her husband is most of the time in fieldwork. Several head of livestock yield up to six liters of milk daily, which Beishekan delivers immediately to local consumers for 11 soms per liter. \r\n\r\nBeishekan is also a proud mother of nine kids, most of whom already live on their own. For her the most successful accomplishment in her entire lifetime is giving her kids broader opportunities to choose who they want to be. Since agriculture is a seasonal business, during slow times the only source of income is the dairy business. Beishekan used a start-up capital of 3 000 soms. Now her business generates 2 000 soms of monthly income. The purpose of the loan is the purchase of 1 ton of potato seeds. The fieldwork season has started, so Beishekan says the seeds have to be sown as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She resides in the town of Toktogul with her husband and their five children, the youngest of whom is 6. Ainura\u2019s husband is a construction worker in a local company, while Ainura relies on cattle-reselling in order to make a living. \r\n\r\nAinura considers having five children a luxury, therefore she invests a big portion of the family income in the children\u2019s development costs like education, healthcare and social life. However she remembers a period five years ago, when the family faced a harsh financial downturn and Ainura had to sacrifice her monthly income by investing it in the--in those times--risky purchase of  livestock. The risk has paid back. \r\n\r\nA few years later, Ainura\u2019s household increased, and so did sales. She has experience in coping with any kind of livestock except poultry. This time Ainura is eager to try something new like adding several types of poultry to her household. With this purpose she addressed Kiva lenders. She is full of enthusiasm and strength to work further and always try something new. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

In addition to a moral loss, it also was financial. He was the main breadwinner of the family, while Damira had devoted all her time to their kids. \r\n\r\nLater, as a widow, Damira invested 12 000 soms of family savings into acquiring a herd of livestock, which she feeds, fattens and later resells at a higher price. Currently Damira has nineteen-year-old and sixteen-year-old sons, who depend on her financially and who actively participate in cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nRelying on the assistance of her boys, Damira got involved in trade, too. The source for an initial capital of 12 000 soms was also a salary from teaching in a local high school. According to Damira trade has appealed to her most of all professions she experienced. It gives her chances to have direct communication with customers, study their tastes and preferences, and find things in business that need to be improved. However she wishes to continue running both businesses of cattle reselling and trade together. That allows her to increase the family capital and cover all expenses.

This area is dedicated to farming, cattle and tourism. \r\n\r\nThe activity Jos\u00e9 does has been selling basic necessity products (rice, milk, oil, sugar, etc.), from his home for some years. Since the business is in his home, he can attend to it at any time, allowing himself to distinguish himself from the other stores and thus obtain more income for his personal use.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Jos\u00e9 has asked Edpyme Alternativa for is for 3000 nuevos soles. This will be used to diversify his merchandise and thus expand his business with more products once his sales increase.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's dream is to have a wholesale business that generates good income to improve his quality of life. He will accomplish this with his hard work and dedication.

She has three children, aged 11, 8, and 1. The older children are in school. Her husband is a fisherman.\r\n\r\nShe raises pigs and poultry. She has a small farm on her property and she says during certain seasons she purchases from one hundred to two hundred chickens. She raises them during two or three months which is the time needed to for them to be ready for sale. She processes them and sells them to stores in the vicinity. She also sells by taking orders or to merchants who come to her house. The pigs are slaughtered and sold as meat by the pound. She has 5 years in the business.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to purchase a larger number of poultry, feed, and medicines. This is her fourth loan cycle with the communal bank. She is the treasurer of the group and she is very happy because it has helped her so much. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a farm that will supply these products to the entire province."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":767438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase poultry, feed, and medicines for the livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-05-13T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Jenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":803,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.51,"local_amount":133.84,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":137.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211225301,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":133.84,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504092,"comment":null},{"amount":137.51,"local_amount":133.84,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":137.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668037,"comment":null},{"amount":137.51,"local_amount":133.84,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":137.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036786,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":133.84,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797357,"comment":null},{"amount":137.47,"local_amount":133.8,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-17T09:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":137.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608473,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-14T02:42:07Z","paid_date":"2011-11-17T09:29:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":297353,"name":"Maritza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maritza es socia del banco comunal Las Dalilas del Distrito D.

Carlita has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Carlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Carlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI.  This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. \r\n\r\nCarlita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products like canned goods and junk food.  This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Carlita from HSPFI.

is a hard-working woman who is married and has four children. Her husband left for Russia to work and for 10 years she has been running her farming business. Now Sanoat is the only breadwinner, considering that her husband works away from their country. So for that reason she cultivates potatoes and sells them. In this business her son helps her in order to improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\n Sanoat would like to get a loan of 10,000 Somoni for purchasing fertilizer for her land which allows her to get a good harvest. It is the first loan which she has requested and she hopes that the lenders will support her.   \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Aurelia is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients such as flour, sugar, and milk. This loan will be Aurelia second loan from HSPFI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his big family: his wife Tamar, his parents and two sons (15 and 16 years old). Irakli\u2019s sons go to a local school. \r\n\r\nIrakli heads up the agricultural farm owned by the family, though Tamar and Irakli\u2019s parents are actively involved in farming activities. They have six greenhouses, where they grow greens. The end product is sold to exporters of greens. Greenhouses are also used for growing tomatoes. Tomatoes are sold on the local market. In addition to the above-mentioned, the family has three cows, whose dairy products are sold on the local market. \r\n\r\nWith the requested credit, Irakli plans to purchase fertilizers and also pay for the tractor for tilling the land.
