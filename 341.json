is married with two daughters. He lives in Vodyanoye and owns two well-equipped greenhouses. Alexei grows early spring vegetables, i.e. tomatoes, radishes, etc. His wife and parents are actively helping him with this venture. Alexei has been in this business for six years. Presently, he has about 20,000 Grivnyas invested in this business.

fue as\u00ed como con su ayuda se inici\u00f3 en la venta de pescado y mariscos, negocio del cual se siente orgullosa porque con el sostiene su hogar, apoya el estudio de sus hijas y hasta compr\u00f3 una nueva mejora y se traslad\u00f3 a ella arrendando la vivienda que le dej\u00f3 su marido al morir, la cual representa un nuevo ingreso.\n\nAunque Sobeida no estudi\u00f3 sabe lo importante que es educarse para la vida por esos su m\u00e1ximo prop\u00f3sito es que sus dos peque\u00f1as hijas de  13 y 15 a\u00f1os lleguen  a ser profesionales, para eso les ense\u00f1a a ser persistentes y  les proporciona lo necesario para que Angie Paola cumpla su sue\u00f1o de ser fisioterapeuta y Marcela tenga la oportunidad de estudiar y ser profesional de la hoteler\u00eda y el turismo. \n\nEl negocio de Sobeida tiene m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os, pero solo ingres\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo desde hace dos, a ella le recomend\u00f3 su amiga Diosa, que tambi\u00e9n es financiada por esta entidad, porque observaba que sus deudas con pagadiario \u201cno le rend\u00edan el dinero por los onerosos intereses que pagaba\u201d;

It is then she takes her cooler full of ice, fish and seafood, puts it in her wheelbarrow and goes off happily fulfilling the orders she took from customers the previous day. Sobeida is used to walking daily between 6 and 11 a.m., traveling through more than 10 neighborhoods surrounding her home in Villalozano, Soledad - Atl\u00e1ntico. She felt the need to work when her husband died, leaving her with five children. At first she was a housemaid, but a friend saw the sadness she showed in leaving her small children alone and recommended that she look for an independent business that would allow her to be close to her children and at the same time generate income. This is how she started selling fish and seafood, a business that she feels proud of because it is her family's sustenance. The business supports her children's education and even helped her buy a new and improved home that the family moved to, and she rents the home her husband left her when he died, which adds to her income. Although Sobeida didn't go to school, she knows the importance of education in life, and for this reason her biggest goal is for her two small daughters, ages 13 and 15, to become successful. That is why she teaches them to be persistent and provides what is necessary for Angie Paola to fulfill her dream of being a physical therapist and for Marcela to have the opportunity to study hotel management and tourism and become a professional. Sobeida's business is more than five years old, but she has only worked with Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the past two years after her friend Diosa, also a client of the institution, recommended it to her after seeing her debt payments. \"Don't give up your money to the onerous interest you pay,\" she told her. This is how Sobeida came to request financing, and since then she has taken out two loans, the latest of which she plans to use to purchase higher volumes of fish and specialty seafoods. She tells us that her clientele has grown to more than 100 customers and her goal is to make some basic adjustments to her new home with her added income. In the future she wants to set up a sales post selling seafood cocktails prepared with delicious sauces, cilantro and onions picked from the outskirts of her neighborhood, and the people will walk from far away to enjoy her delicacies. Her customers prefer her products because she shows them how to prepare the fish by using unique recipes, which adds to the value of her business. It is very normal to see Sobeida explaining to housewives and small restaurant owners how to add carrots, beans, garlic, onion, lemon pepper to their fish, season it to taste, tie it with string and put it to roast. This is her famous Cabrito, which is served with fried plantain or cassava, green salad and sweet water. This is how she won the hearts of her customers and positioned herself to sell her exquisite products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

He lives with his wife and their two children, ages 17 and 10, who are in school and whom he wants to see be successful. Every morning Luis takes his motorcycle to a bakery in the south of the city where he buys bread and drives through all of Barranquilla, north, south, east and west, to distribute the products store to store, which are his best and most faithful customers. Before becoming involved in this business in the year 2000, he worked at a company cleaning and painting boats. He learned of the bread distributing business from his brother, who then had a bakery, and he liked it because the work was comfortable aside from the traffic that he has to confront day to day. He covers all the neighborhoods of Barranquilla, from the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar neighborhood in the south to the beach in the north. With the business he has been able to gradually increase his income because his has expanded his merchandise, and each storekeeper recommends him for his punctuality. His work has made it possible for his children to get an education and gives the family income to cover basic necessities. Along with being a distributor, he dreams of having a bakery with many vendors, so other honest people like him can make money to provide for their households, and that would increase the profitability of his current business as well. Luis is applying for a loan in order to purchase baskets to attach to his vehicle so he can have more space to include new products and to start up a line of sliced breads to expand his product reach, especially to restaurants and house events. Currently he is facing the challenge of the transit department regulating baskets on bikes, and he is looking for a solution that would enable him to work with less risk. For this reason, his goal is to purchase a vehicle better suited to his goals and requirements so he can extend his business to all the people of the region and every day expand his business that has provided him with the opportunity to live with dignity.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

The two live in a home they own located in a frigid zone in the Peruvian mountains. His father died when Andr\u00e9s was a young man (23 years old), so he was forced to take control of the household finances. Even though he didn't care for agriculture, he started planting potatoes, peas, and corn on his father's land. What saddens Andr\u00e9s is not having his own family to accompany him and support his farming activities, or expecting a hot meal after a difficult day. Despite the difficulties he has faced, he considers his work lucrative because thanks to his profits he has been able to take care of household expenses as well as purchase more land that is now producing great harvests. Along with the hope of forming a family and having a number of children, in the future he wishes to keep saving money so he can build a home in the city where he can set up a business selling tubers, and he also wants to increase his agricultural production. This is his sixth loan through Kiva partner MFP, and he already is familiar with the workings of a community bank and wants to continue working with his group of demanding and responsible people. He plans to use the money he is requesting to complement his saving to purchase a truck so he can haul his harvest from his village to the city to sell it.

He lives with his wife Clerina, who is the same age.  They have 2 children: Jazm\u00edn is 10 and Diana is 4.  They live in their own house high in the mountains of Peru.\r\n\r\nFor 12 years Delbor has devoted himself to agriculture, growing potatoes, peas and flowers (gladiolus).  He relies on his wife's unconditional help, and what he likes best about his work is growing potatoes and seeing how the plants flower, since the flowers show him the size of the crop.  Since he always makes an effort to take good care of his land, he almost never loses his harvests.  What he doesn't like is that he sometimes has to fight inclement weather, like rain, that holds up his work.  Despite this, he believes his work is quite profitable because it allows him to pay for his children's education and for basic household expenses.

M.  is 54 years old.  He was born in Barranquilla, but he comes from a family of shoemakers of Paisan ethnicity (from the department of Antioquia.)  He lives in the Soledad 2000 neighborhood with his wife, but he works in the La Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood to the north of the City of Barranquilla.  He is a cobbler; he offers the service of fixing shoes and in addition he purchases purses and shoes to sell to his customers.  With this work he has always supported his family and has managed to acquire his own home.  \r\n\r\nAlthough this is the first time that he is receiving a loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, he is very hopeful and happy with this new financing.  He found out about this organization because a friend recommended it and likewise he recommends it to many more people so that they can benefit like him.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is to advance his family and that every member of his family will achieve their particular goals.  He plans to replace the roof of his kiosk and improve the image of his business by painting it.  In addition he will restock his supply of purses and shoes, especially for the carnival season when sales increase.  To do this he requests a loan of $1,500 to buy ready-made purses and shoes.  \r\n\r\nWilmer works with his brother in a kiosk at the side of a church located on a corner in the La Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood where he has been located for 18 years.  Although many of his relatives are cobblers, he started working in a shoe company as a messenger.  After his brother taught him the skills of shoemaking and repair, that he himself had learned from his grandfather, Wilmer began working as a cobbler.  For 4 years he walked the streets with a small case and a box shouting \"Cobbler!\"  until the priest of the church offered him and his brother the space that they now occupy.  From the start he liked it because there was no other cobbler stand and now he has more than 800 customers. He is satisfied that his good references and letters of recommendation from his customers will serve to help him access credit.  His kiosk is located in a commercial zone, next to a supermarket and many other stores.  His customers come from all parts; they leave their shoes with Wilmer and make their purchases while Wilmer fixes them.  He is careful with the repairs that he makes.  For example, when replaces the heel on a shoe he always adds stain and polishes the shoe so that you can't tell that it's been repaired, because he knows that satisfied customers are the ones that will return.  They want to have their used shoes look like new, and for this reason they seek out Wilmer.  Normally he has 20 customers, and at times even 30.  In these months between November and February he is very busy because the new year is starting for the students and the schools.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

In meetings, they demonstrate that they are active and unified people. Amongst the things they do, we can mention the sale of cosmetics, food sales, sausage production, meat sales, sandals, men that work as bricklayers, and passenger transportation within the neighborhood of Portachuelo. The competition is really quite difficult, especially in food and cosmetic sales, so that every member hopes every day to increase her sales. There is high competition, so the members don\u2019t have permanent shops. Instead, they travel for their sales so that they can make higher earnings throughout the day. The loan is for the purchase of merchandise to increase their sales, as well as the purchase of consumables for food sales, the repair of vehicles, and those that are bricklayers want to purchase tools of their trade to speed up their work and generate better incomes for their children. A majority of the members are new and are already familiar with the product. They are enthusiastic about the economic help, as many of them have big projects that they want to realize in the future and know that if they complete their payment responsibly, they can count on the support of the foundation whenever they will need it. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva

Some work from home and others are street vendors. As for the competitive environment, one could say that it is difficult but the group members know how to get ahead. This might mean traveling to far-off markets or diversifying their merchandise in order to obtain the income necessary to support their families.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to acquire merchandise such as sugar and flour, and those that sell cosmetics have taken advantage of sales, all with the purpose of bettering the quality of life for their families and to be able to give their children a better future.\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the group are new to the loan process but know their products well, and for this reason they are excited about the economic support.

One of them is Karla Patricia G. M., who has a small grocery store.  Rosa Argentina M. A. has sold clothing, frozen treats, beer, ice and prepared meals for the last 28 years; this has allowed her to raise her children successfully.  She tells us that her business does well but, on a personal front, she was weighed down by the fact that her son did not have any contact with his daughter, who asked about him a lot.  However, thanks to God, she managed to reunite them this Christmas and they have begun to have a better relationship with each other.  Carolina L. makes and sells tortillas and nacatamales (steamed maize dumpling with savory filling, wrapped in a banana leaf) on weekends, an activity that has gradually been growing and improving her quality of life.  She is a strong woman who has suffered much by the fact that she has never been able to care for her oldest daughter because, having had her when she was very young, her parents decided to give the child to a relative to raise.

For the last two years he has sold gasoline from his home.  He began this work because the earnings he made from working as a field hand were not enough to meet family expenses.  Gasoline is very useful in the area where he lives, above all for irrigation of farmlands, because the great majority of fields do not have irrigation canals and the crops must be watered with water that is extracted from wells by motors.  He also works as an agricultural field hand.  Roman is aware that he must exhert the greatest effort daily if he is to support his family so he gives his all to the tasks he does.

L. is from the village of Hasan Lopez Jaena Misamis Occidental. She is 43 years old. Rebecca is married and has eight school-aged children. To make a living, Rebecca owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks like rice cakes called \"puto\" in the local community. Rebecca has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 700 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rebecca joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rebecca is requesting a new loan of 3500 PHP, which will be used to buy additional capital for her business. This will be the first loan taken out by Rebecca from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the daily needs of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 53 years old, is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Veronica owns amd operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting coconut for sale. Veronica has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Veronica joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.

She is 33 years old, married, and has three school-age children. To earn a living, Roselyn owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" store and a vegetable-selling business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different vegetables to her local community members. Roselyn has been engaged in this line of business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month on account of these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Roselyn joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) to gain access to financial services. As a result, she was able to engage in business activities and to improve her family's standard of living. Notably, Roselyn recently repaid a prior loan in the amount of 25,000 PHP from PMPC. Roselyn is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 50,000 PHP ($1,100), which will be used to buy housing materials for some much-needed home improvement work. This loan would be the sixth loan taken out by Roselyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

C. is from the village of Matugas Bajo, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. He is 27 years old. Rodney is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Rodney owns and operates a service-based business providing motorcycle repairs in his shop to local community members. Rodney has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately $142 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rodney joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Rodney has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide his repair services. Rodney is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital for his business. This will be his 2nd loan from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Carlita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities. \r\n<br>In 2002, Carlita joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Carlita is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional items of clothing. This loan will be her fifth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Maria Linda has been engaged in her business for 3 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP ($125) per month on account of these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Maria Linda joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) to gain access to financial services. In turn, she was able to engage in business activities and to improve her standard of living. Notably, Maria Linda recently repaid a prior loan in the amount of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Maria Linda is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to provide additional working capital. This loan would be the fifth loan taken out by Maria Linda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan proceeds to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

They realize that their lack of education has led to their poverty, and they want a better life for their children. The couple has a strong belief not to be affected by poverty; instead they are inspired to work hard for their children.\r\n\r\nFebelita joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap Inc.), a Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 1995; since then, she has grown to love the organization. ASHI helped her in the start-up of a business, enabling her to support her husband in their daily expenditures.\r\n\r\nFebelita and her husband have been in the fishing business for more than ten years. She now proposes that her eighth loan of Php 25,000 be used to continue their fishing business with the support of her husband. She will purchase assorted equipment for her fishing business like fishing net, rope, and bamboo. The remaining loan will be use to pay for a cow for additional income.\r\n\r\nFebelita hopes that this business will be the source of income to finance the needs of her family and to provide a comfortable house to live in. She is very thankful to all members of ASHI for educating her, especially in dealing with other people, generating an ability to accept new challenges in her life, and helping her to achieve her dreams and improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\nFebelita is grateful to the ASHI-Kiva partnership for supporting people like her who want to get out of poverty and get ahead.

J. is from the village of Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling NFA rice in the local community. Ezel has been engaged in her business for 4 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ezel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ezel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Ezel is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Ezel from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model).\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":475179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

S. is 36 years old, and is a good mother blessed with five children. Her two grown daughters work in a garment factory while other three go to school. Her husband is a palm climber who taps palm juice and turns it into sugar for sale. \r\n<br>Mang S. stays at home to make Khmer noodles. She also takes the noodles to retail sellers at the market.

Wilfreda is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to pay the tuition fees of her children. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Wilfreda from PMPC and this is her second time with Kiva. She wishes that someday her children can gain degrees. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":475309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary

The family has access to electricity and piped water and gets three meals a day. She doesn\u2019t incur transport costs because she buys from her place of work. She works in a semi-urban area in the outskirts of Kampala. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 20 customers a day and sells to all categories of people on a retail and wholesale basis.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and the rainy season, which hinders her customers' ability to reach her, as she works from a muddy place. Annette has been in this business for 15 years and with MCDT for six years, servicing her 10th loan and working with the same group mates. Annette joined MCDT, a Kiva partner, because it was near her home and was working with poor women. \r\n\r\nShe wants to use this loan to buy more crates of beer and jerrycans of alcohol.

She belongs to a poor family who needs help to change their standard of living and to be able to pursue their family dreams.\r\n\r\nWith her belief in getting out of poverty, she decided in 2007 to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with start-up capital for generating income. During her previous loans from ASHI, she carefully invested in her sari-sari store (a small retail store selling different goods). The income is what she uses for daily expenses.\r\n\r\nNow on her fourth loan, Lylin requests 20,000 PHP to create a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase 16 sacks of rice and groceries for her store. She is very determined and disciplined to use the funds that are lent to her. \r\n\r\nDuring her almost three years in ASHI, she has shown herself to be hard-working and has strong beliefs to make her dreams come true. She would love to have her own durable and concrete house someday. Lylin C. still dreams of the best for her family: to provide the best education for her children and to have a happy family. She is grateful to ASHI-Kiva partner for support, even in all of her dreams and the challenges in

is 25 years old and doesn\u2019t yet have a child as she is still young in marriage. She and her devoted husband live in Nyaruguru, in the Southern Province of Rwanda.\r\n\r\nAlphonsine owns a shop selling a variety of goods including some cosmetic goods, foodstuffs like sugar and cooking oil and some soft drinks. This is her 3rd successful year in this business and her shop is open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. everyday.\r\n\r\nAlthough Alphonsine has been in the business since 2007, her profit is still too low to expand meaningfully and she believes that a small amount of additional capital would change that for her. For that reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company in order to purchase some additional goods such as Irish potatoes, rice, corn flour, salt, etc.\r\n\r\nWith these additional goods for sale, Alphonsine hopes to earn more profits, which in turn will help her and her devoted husband to build a secure future for their family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":475374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy additional goods such as Irish potatoes, rice, corn flour, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"NYARUGURU","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-01-22T18:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alphonsine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":128407.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169439,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":64203.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760328,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":64203.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022758,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":64203.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781823,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":64203.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709701,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":64203.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037066,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":64203.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172308793,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-22T20:42:57Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170742,"name":"Marlyna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlyna B. is from the village of Gitagum, Misamis Oriental.

Most of them live in polygamous households in the Babemba district of the city of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). These women work in partnership with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution to satisfy the needs of their clientele. This is their fourth group loan. The previous loans were fully repaid. \r\n\r\nThe sell potatoes, Kola nuts and have a restaurant business. With this new loan, they plan on buying 325 kg of potatoes, 2 baskets of Kola nuts, 200 kg of rice and 6 packages of food seasoning (for the restaurant). They get their supplies at the Sikasso city market and in the neighbouring villages. They sell their products at the M\u00e9dine market, by walking through the neighborhood and around home. The sales are done in cash and often on credit to male and female customers. \r\n\r\nEach woman expects a monthly revenue of 31 500 CFA francs, part of which will be saved to pay for certain family expenses and part of which will be put back into the business. They are striving to decorate their sales booth and open a store to better satisfy their customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Joanne Archambault, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":475399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase diverse products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-22T23:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haby ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dounaba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maram ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-26T09:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":67741.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152497,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":67741.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991345,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-20T08:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67741.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021620,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":67741.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746410,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":67741.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778946,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":67741.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961158,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T05:45:10Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170769,"name":"Elsira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsira D. is from the village of Tumpagon, Cagayan de Oro City.

She lives with her husband and their five children in Mamassoni, a town bordering the city of Sikasso in the third administrative region of Mali. Kadia D., after having pursued many professions unsuccessfully, began buying and selling clothing and second-hand clothing. She runs her business from home where she is often solicited by clients for the quality of her products.\r\nTo satisfy her growing clientele, she decided to rejoin the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso over three years ago. After two group loans with an association of women from her village, she is on her fourth individual loan.

F. is from the village of Owaon in Dapitan City. She is 46 years old, married, and has three school-age children. To earn a living, Myrna owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector. More specifically, she operates a general store, selling a variety of products to local community members. Myrna has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP per month on account of these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Myrna joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) to gain access to financial services. As a result, she was better equipped to engage in business activities and to improve her family's standard of living. Notably, Myrna recently repaid a loan in the amount of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This prior loan was used to to purchase additional inventory for the store, as well as fertilizers for gardening activities. Myrna is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 14,900 PHP ($325), which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to supplement her existing working capital. This loan would be the fourth loan taken out by Myrna from PMPC and her second loan via Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor by using the Grameen micro-lending model."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":475470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand

And her customers are mainly foreign tourists, who love her work.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo make a bag, Bintou needs four rolls of multi-colored nylon string, plus some red wood (b\u00e9t\u00e9).\u00a0 Then, she knits them using a metallic hook.\u00a0 Making a bag can take two days.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nPlanning to increase her business capital, in order to take part in the festivals on the Niger next month, she turned toward micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on her first individual loan.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy ten packets of nylon string and ten iron bars for chairs.\u00a0 She supplies herself locally.\u00a0 She makes her sales in cash to customers composed of women and men (foreigners and nationals).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Bintou envisions realizing a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA.\u00a0 This profit will be used as operating funds and as support in covering household expenses.\u00a0 Her ambition is to expand her workshop.\u00a0<br

The secret of her success is simple: not only does she tell her customers the benefits of her products, but she also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop where she is with her venture. Mahbuba is seeking a loan of $1000 USD to re-stock the merchandise in her store.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is 45 years old. She is married and a mother of two children who are in school. Nori started her business because she needed extra income to be able to pay for household and personal expenses. She also needed her own income in order to afford her home. Nori began selling teenagers clothing and shoes 10 years ago. She had always liked sales and the business did well after it started. Since then, she has continued to sell clothing. To expand her business Nori is requesting a loan of $1500 USD.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. It is also a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. It is also a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

married women of monogamous households who average 30 years of age and five children living in the chief locale of the rural community of Cinzana Gare (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 The women know one another through ties of kinship and their professional work.\u00a0 They do commerce in various goods, make the local beer, and work in food catering.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe group members are on their second group loan after having correctly repaid the first one.\u00a0 This new loan will be used to buy:\u00a0 two sacks of rice, nine sacks of millet, twelves sacks of potatoes, a 30-liter container of oil, six boxes of Omo detergent, a sack of sugar, a box of tea, two cart-loads of firewood, and some empty bottles.\u00a0Their goods are purchased at the Cinzana Gare weekly fair, except for the firewood and the empty bottles, which are filled with <i>dolo<\/i>, the local beer.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nTo make the local beer, you wash the millet and keep it moist until it germinates.\u00a0 Then you spread it out under the sun.\u00a0 After a few hours, you mill it and cook it.\u00a0 A little baobab leaf powder is added during the cooking.\u00a0 You filter and then ferment it for two to three days before selling it. \r\n\r\nA portion of the potatoes is fried and then sold.\u00a0 The goods are sold at the marketplace and in homes.\u00a0 Cash or credit is accepted from customers composed of men and women.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average monthly profit of 20,500 francs CFA that will be used to cover the loan interest, to help with certain family expenses, and to take part in societal events (marriages, baptisms, circumcisions, and funerals).\u00a0 Their ambition comes down to increasing the loan amounts borrowed, enabling them to diversify their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Support this woman of much strength and courage so she can keep working!    <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and three married) in polygamous households.\u00a0 The women average 38 years of age and four children each living in the chief locale of the rural community of Cinzana Gare (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 The women know one another through ties of community, kinship, their commercial businesses, and from belonging to the same women's association of Cinzana Gare.\u00a0 This group of women truly became specialized in food service, which constitutes their main work.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe group members are on their second solidarity loan after having properly repaid their first one.\u00a0 This new loan will be used to buy:  two sacks of rice, two sacks of millet, two sacks of wheat flour, a 20-liter container of oil, thirty pouches of spaghetti, and some condiments necessary for cooking various dishes.\u00a0 All of their goods are purchased locally at the Cinzana Gare weekly fair.\u00a0 These groceries are all destined for food catering.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe millet is pounded, freed of its bran, washed gently, and then milled into a fine flour for making steamed cakes.\u00a0 To make them, you add a little wheat flour to the fine millet flour and mix well;\u00a0 add some sugar, salt, and a little leavening with water; knead this mixture until obtaining a uniform dough;\u00a0 seal it up tightly for at least an hour;\u00a0 knead it again, and roll it into five-centimeter balls.\u00a0 Then you steam them using a pierced <i>canaris<\/i>\u00a0(terra cotta vessel).\u00a0 This is how you make our millet cakes called <i>takoula<\/i>.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSales of the goods are carried out at the Cinzana Gare marketplace and especially at the weekly fair and at home.\u00a0 The <i>takoula<\/i> is sold in front of mosques on Fridays or by special order.\u00a0 A portion of the wheat flour is fried and then sold.\u00a0 Cash or credit is accepted from customers composed of men and women.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average monthly profit of 13,500 francs CFA that will be used to cover the loan interest, to buy food, and to take part in societal events.\u00a0 Their main ambition is to diversify their business by taking up the raising of small ruminants.\u00a0<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

T. is a 53-year old married woman who lives in Brgy Binicuil Kabankalan City Negros Occidental. She earns her living by direct selling personal  & specialty products and RTW (Ready-to-Wear) Clothes.\r\n\r\nMilagros and her husband Danilo have 3 children who are between 25 and 33 years old. Two children are already established with their own families. Milagros is quite proud that one of her children now works as a bookkeeper in the Toledo Branch of NWTF-Project Dunggganon in the island of Cebu.\r\n\r\nMilaros joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1981 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in direct selling activities and RTW. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 8,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMilagros is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations of her direct selling and RTW, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 7th loan for the amount of Php 17,000, which she intends to use on direct selling and RTW. Milagros is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":475180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods

B. is a 46-year-old married woman who lives in Gregoria Village Brgy 3, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by manufacturing hollow blocks. Gemma\u2019s husband, Jeorge, helps her run the business. They have three children who are between 17 and 23 years old. Two of the children have already graduated from college and now are seeking employment. One of her children is still going to school.\r\n\r\nGemma B. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in manufacturing hollow blocks. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nGemma B. is a member in good standing.

S. tiene 61 a\u00f1os y vive en el barrio Mart\u00ednez Martelo de Cartagena, ciudad colonial y tur\u00edstica del Caribe Latino, de clima soleado y playas con aguas c\u00e1lidas. Se siente muy orgullosa de su barrio  pues es uno de los m\u00e1s antiguos de Cartagena y queda circundado por una de las bah\u00edas mas lindas del mundo, la bah\u00eda de Cartagena y cercano a un mercado de alimentos y productos variados, el mercado de Bazurto, zona de gran afluencia comercial de la cual se aprovisiona.\nMar\u00eda Inici\u00f3 su negocio de manera incipiente  con una fotocopiadora, desde este local se dedicaba a la   venta de seguros obligatorios de accidentes de transito (SOAT) por intermedio  de una compa\u00f1\u00eda aseguradora; lo que pronto la hizo muy reconocida en la plaza de este mercado que d\u00eda a d\u00eda solicitaba otros servicios como el de laminar documentos, que la llevaron a adquirir  una laminadora d\u00e1ndole respuesta a las necesidades de sus mimados clientes;  Con todo esto Mar\u00eda se sent\u00eda  muy entusiasmada con su negocio pues  observ\u00f3 d\u00eda a d\u00eda como  su clientela aumentaba y  una vez mas requer\u00edan de ella otros servicios como el de telefon\u00eda, lo que la condujo a acceder a dos amplios planes de telefon\u00eda celular para que sus clientes pudieran efectuar llamadas a destinos locales, nacionales e internacionales. Su experiencia la ha llevado a escuchar la voz del cliente, por esta raz\u00f3n una de sus metas principales es la de comprar un cubetero con capacidad de 500 cubetas ya que en su negocio hay una gran demanda de refrescos.  \nEn la actualidad requiere un financiamiento por valor de  $1.500.000 para invertirlo en  la compra de insumos para la fotocopiadora como papeler\u00eda y tinta, acceder a amplios planes de telefon\u00eda celular y comprar mercanc\u00eda  variada, aprovechando su infraestructura y la capacidad comercial de su ubicaci\u00f3n.

The city has a sunny climate and beaches with warm water. She feels great pride in her neighborhood as it is one of the oldest in Cartegena and is surrounded by one of the most beautiful bays in the world, Cartegena Bay, and close to a market that sells foods and various other goods, the Bazurto market, which is an area of great commercial activity which is well stocked-up. <p>\r\nMar\u00eda started her business in a small way with a photocopier, since this area specializes in the sale of a special type of insurance for travel accidents through the medium of an insurance company. She immediately made herself well-know in the market where people asked her for other related services, such as laminating documents. So, she added a laminator to her business, allowing her to respond to the needs of her well-served clients. With all this, Mar\u00eda feels very enthusiastic about her business, and she has seen her cliental grow day by day and once again ask her for new services such as telephone service. So she added two comprehensive cell phone plans so that her clients can call locally, nationally, and internationally. Her experience has taught her to listen to her clients, and for this reason it is one of her main goals to buy a fridge with 500 unit capacity since their is a great demand for soft drinks in her business premises. <p>\r\nAt this moment, she needs a loan of $1,500 to buy supplies for the photocopier such as paper and ink, subscribe to cell phone plans, and to buy various merchandise, thus taking advantage of the infrastructure and capacity of her location. Mar\u00eda has a son who is 40 years old, and she is happy to have a business in the city of Cartegena.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva

desde hace 5 a\u00f1os hacia la ciudad de Cartagena, en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus 3 hijos de 9, 7 y 2 a\u00f1os y de su esposo, quien dedicado a las labores del campo no encontr\u00f3 trabajo digno en la ciudad; as\u00ed fu\u00e8 como ella asumi\u00f3 la responsabilidad del sustento de su hogar, practicando los conocimientos de costura que aprendi\u00f3 desde muy ni\u00f1a y que con la ayuda de una generosa pareja que le don\u00f3 una m\u00e1quina de coser, pudo iniciar muy entusiasmada el negocio de confecciones que hoy tiene y con el que sue\u00f1a verlo crecer y ayudarla a su prosperidad

llamado \u201cConfecciones Angie\u201d, compra telas e insumos de bajo costo y elabora vestidos econ\u00f3micos, ella dice que con ello contribuye a aliviar la problem\u00e1tica de capacidad de compra

Cartagena.  She is a native of the town of San Juan de Nepomuceno in the department of Bol\u00edvar, which at the this moment has been hit with insecurity, violence and forced displacement, requiring Nora to flee this conflict area 5 years ago to the city of Cartagena.  She fled along with her 3 children of 9,7,and 2 years and her husband, who works in the countryside since he could not find decent work in the city.  It was thus that she assumed the responsibility of supporting the household, practicing her trade as a seamstress that she learned when she was very young.  With the help of a generous couple who gave her a sewing machine she was able to start, with great enthusiasm, the business that she has today.  She hopes to see this business grow and help her family become more prosperous, and she directs all of her efforts toward these goals.  \n\nShe feels satisfied with her life, and gives thanks to God daily for being alive.  She reaffirms the saying that every cloud has a silver lining, because with the displacement she found the opportunity to have a better future in a different place, which perhaps she might not have had in the place where she was born.  In her business, called \"Confecciones Angie\" (Creations by Angie), she buys fabrics and supplies at low cost and makes economical dresses.  She says that with this business she helps alleviate the problem that people have in her neighborhood of not having enough money to buy new clothing, and says that \"her customers feel very satisfied being able to wear a new dress for the first time.\"  \n\nHer first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation was for $1,500, which she paid back strictly according to the established schedule.  She invested it in a variety of merchandise that helped her to obtain greater profits, which enabled her to acquire new household appliances and utensils that she did not yet have. She is now applying for a loan of $2,000 that she will use to buy raw materials and supplies to make clothing, to buy shoes and baby clothes to put on sale in her glass display case, and to acquire a new sewing machine, because in addition to making clothes she also sells merchandise in her neighborhood.  \n\nHer greatest dream is to have a home and a place to organize and expand her business, managing to acquire state-of-the-art technology and positioning herself in the market offering many jobs and generating profits to help the human, spiritual and professional growth of her children and future employees.  Her current challenge is that she lacks the adequate training and machinery to do work of the best quality and to start, along with her husband and his family, to set up and develop a large apparel company.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Although she is still very young, she knows what it is to work all day to have enough money available to pay for her schooling.  She owns a very well-known liquor store that is one of the main ones in the district where she lives.  She also stocks soft-drinks and some sweets.

Her husband gets up early every morning to fire a kiln while Zenaida helps make the clay mix that is then molded and left to dry in the sun all day.  Once the mix dries, they put the bricks in the kiln to bake for 24 hours.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Zenaida's 13th MFP loan.  She is very committed to her community bank and she will continue working to strengthen the group.  The loan that she is applying for now will be used to buy the materials necessary to make bricks: sand, wood chips and lime.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":475669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy materials for brick manufacturing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T02:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124503,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960244,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993088,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717874,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751549,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":166.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934017,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T03:50:07Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170928,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fresh fish ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2010-02-01T17:45:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170929,"name":"Dionisia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Dionisia G.

He only has electricity and running water.  His wife is a housewife and they have a son, who is a year and three months old.  Carlos' brother used to own a bakery but, when he got married, there was an inefficient administration, and it went broke.  Carlos asked him to sell him the bread-making equipment that he had and he asked him to teach him baking.  Carlos now has a bakery with a minimart attached; he works every day.  He prepares the dough the night before so that in the morning all he has to do is bake it.  He sells salt bread for $0.05 and a liter of milk at $0.70.

Above all, they are very hard-working people who have goals to accomplish. These are some of the stories of the members.\r\n<p>\r\nFor many years Maria del Carmen has been in the business of renting internet booths, a business that helps her with household expenses, but for her was not sufficient. Therefore, in addition, she sells coffee by order, which she buys from an exporter. She is a very enthusiastic member of the group, and she therefore represents the group as president.\r\n<p>\r\nAs she herself says, Martha is a woman with a thousand jobs. She works at different activities that allow her to support her family. With the sale of beer and soft drinks, she has been able to educate her children. In addition she gets up very early to sell bread to all her neighbors. In parallel, she sells meals on a very busy street in the center of Lima. She does all this for the well-being of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nA few years ago Paola began to take courses in pastry-making, which she made use of to the maximum. Now she can support her small daughter doing all types of decoration of cakes and desserts by special order, but this is not sufficient since her parents are helping her. She will invest the loan obtained in buying some supplies and utensils that she is lacking in order to increase her business.\r\n<p>\r\nClarisas is a single mother with 3 children, of whom only 2 are in her care. A long time ago, she began selling candies as a walking vendor. This was very difficult for her since she had to work and take care of her small children, but with much effort she was able to save a little money, with which she opened a store in her house, which up to today is her only means of support. She works hard to offer the necessities to her children.
