G. is from the village of Goleo, Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte.

The other source of income for the family comes from the income of her husband. Weddy has been engaged in her business for 15 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Weddy joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Weddy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to buy more fish to sell in the market. Weddy is requesting a new loan of Php 5,000 which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Weddy from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.  \r\n \r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

First and foremost, it means sacrificing nighttime sleep, doing without respite hours and not having enough time for family. That was the exact experience M. Dan went through before he called it quits and started his five-year-old business selling chapati (unleavened flatbread, similar to tortillas) in Amber Court Market in Jinja.\r\n\r\nFor this single 24-year-old, it was time to cast his mind to the future. Dan knew he had to extricate himself out of this problem. His decision to take up this business was based partly on the fascination Ugandans have with chapati rolled egg omelets and the fact that he needed to find a stable and more convincing livelihood. \r\n\r\nFor the last five years, Dan has shown resilience in stemming the tide of financial and other challenges to his fledgling business that have cropped up. His hard work has been paying dividends as he has been making profits close to 30,000 shillings a week. With his determination the future looks promising.\r\n\r\nDan is planning on expanding his business through the purchase of more bags of chapati baking flour with the assistance of this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":550987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more bags of baking flour to make more chapatis","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Connie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedict","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3400000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":212500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":285.42,"local_amount":646950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":650755.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662541,"comment":null},{"amount":370.83,"local_amount":840550,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":845494.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689318,"comment":null},{"amount":463.48,"local_amount":1050550,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1056729.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903475,"comment":null},{"amount":380.27,"local_amount":861950,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":867020.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296950,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T20:17:37Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206135,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida G. is a hardworking entrepreneur who is determined to improve her family's standard of living.

eight children living for the most part in polygamous families in Nimprodioula, one of the villages of the community of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).

The past loan has been repaid.  \r\n\r\nThe plantings cultivated by this group of men are generally corn, per NAMAKORO D..

They have 2 small children, and all live together in their own cozy home that they built through much sacrifice.  Ricardo's dedication and industriousness have made him one of the best producers of bananas and coffee in the Sanchirio Palomar area.  In spite of being young, he is a responsible father and this motivates him to continue working so that he can provide the best for his family.  At times he is helped out by his wife, especially during the harvest season.  Normally, he works in the fields and his wife carries out the domestic tasks and cares for their children.  For more than a year he has worked in agriculture, and what he likes most is to cultivate and clear his coffee lands.  On the other hand, he does not enjoy the market in his city where they want to haggle on price, where the wholesalers claim that their price is the real market price.  In spite of all of this, he considers this line of work to be sufficiently profitable, since he can cover the household expenses, educate his children and, above all, save.  Currently he has 2 hectares of bananas, and he wants to buy 2 more hectares of land so that he can add to his cultivations and have increased production.  This is the first time that he has taken a loan from MFP, and he is enthusiastic about the idea of working with a communal group where there are rules and regulations to comply with.  With the loan he requests, he will buy 1,600 banana plants to plant on his new land.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":551138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"he will buy 1,600 banana plants to plant on his new land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588206,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-12T15:08:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206196,"name":"Liduvina Elvira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Liduvina tiene 59 a\u00f1os tiene un hijo vive en casa propia, ella inicio este negocio hace ya 4 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, ella trabaja en un local alquilado, se inicio con un capital propio, como tiene experiencia en este negocio trabaja desD. las 6 D. la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 9 D. la noche, teniendo gran margen D. ganancia, ya que ofrece gran vaviedad D. platos a sus clientes los cuales siempre regresan por su buena sazon y bajos precios, el dinero D. este credito sera destinado para colocar piso pulido a la sala D. su inmueble, ya que piensa alquilarlo para poder tener un mayor ingreso, el sue\u00f1o D.

They are friends who have decided to organize a borrowing group together; on the average, they are 45 years old of age and have at least four children. Their village has a big weekly market that attracts thousands of visitors. This factor plays a big role in the economic development of the village and its surrounding areas. The new solidarity (group} loan will allow its members to boost their enterprise. Their main line of business is selling local cereals, seafood products, vegetables and ice cream.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ndella M., the group leader, is depicted on the photo on the right wearing a light blue outfit with yellow and dark blue flowers. She is 48 years old, married and the mother of two children. She is specializing in selling vegetables on big market days; the rest of the time she prepares peanuts in order to sell them in front of her home or as a door-to-door vendor. She excels at this business as she has been doing it for six years already. The goal of her loan is to strengthen her business allowing her to increase her income in order to help improve the life conditions of her family as concerns nutrition and healthcare. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":551156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Strengthening the group's business activities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Diourbel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-06-12T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndelle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dibor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mossane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mbene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Mossane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yacine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mareme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1125000,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2050,"local_amount":1125000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-30T09:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1129210.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182517972,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T23:27:42Z","paid_date":"2010-12-30T09:58:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206209,"name":"Celia Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celia  vive en la zona D.

They live with 2 of their children and one of their grandchildren in their own home.  For more than 5 years he has cultivated coffee and bananas, work that has helped him to live comfortably with his family.  At times his wife helps him with the work, especially during the harvest seasons, since he has to harvest the coffee beans in the least amount of time possible.  In spite of the fact that it is tedious to be a farmer, he is committed to his farming activities because he considers them to be very profitable, and this allows him to meet his basic needs.  He says also that he very much enjoys clearing his lands, which makes it easier to grow his plants.  On the other hand, he dislikes it when the wholesalers haggle over the prices of his harvests referring to the law of supply and demand.  For this reason he tries to work with associations or consortia, who pay a fair price that encourages him to keep working.  Over time he is thinking about acquiring his own land, since he is currently cultivating on rented fields.  In addition, he plans to increase his production, particularly of bananas, which generate bi-weekly income.  This is the second time that he has taken a loan with MFP, and he is proud to belong to a well-organized group and is pleased to work with its members.  With the loan he requests he will buy 7 bags of fertilizer and supplies to prevent weed growth on his land.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She has been working as a housekeeper for the Villanueva family for more than 15 years and has earned their trust, affection, respect, and support throughout this entire time.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is requesting her third loan so that she can continue making improvements to her home, but this time she is seeking assistance through Kiva.  She wants to put up a fence to secure her home and, if there is money left over, repair the windows and doors that are in poor condition.\r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest wish is to have a beautiful home with all the necessities to make her family comfortable.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

He is married and has four schoolaged children. Together they live in the community of Manitea Alta, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle where they have their own house made of wood.  Amelio is a hard working man. He recognizes that what he has accomplished so far has been thanks to his drive and wish to get ahead. Growing cacao is the only thing that he knew how to do, but his parents helped him by counseling him on how to obtain excellent production and better quality. That is why he already has a good customer base. Of course, at times he can't keep up with the work and and he can't keep all of his committments. Because of this, he is always looking for alternatives to be able to satisfy his customers, buying cacao product from other producers, but of the same quality.  Normallly his product is sold in warehousing senters in his same community and for that he needs workers to hep transport his product to the points of sale. His plans for the future are to buy more land to cultivate because he needs to be able to expand his cacao plantings. This is his sixth loan with  MFP. He is committted to keep making his payments. He also thanks his community group for the support that each member has. With the loan he has asked for, he will invest in buying a greater quantity of cacao from other producers with the need of incerasing his income and satisfying his potential customers.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":551261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cacao from other producers to increase his income.

They started in the business because he worked at a prawn enterprise at a fishing port in the Manabi province.  They started to save money when he decided to leave this job to start their own business.  He now travels to purchase prawns by the case, which they sell by the pound to family and friends who are loyal buyers.  Separate from this business, Sheryl also sells clothing, an enterprise she started approximately 2 years ago.  This work is easy, because she already has a steady customer base.  With this business, she also helps to support the family financially.

They live together in the beautiful Cuzco rainforest, in the community of Manitea Alta, where they have their own home. She barely completed secondary school, but that hasn\u2019t prevented her from working in agriculture.  She recalls that she had to work hard to establish herself in farming  and tells how she put a lot of determination and dedication into getting a good yield of crops.   What\u2019s more, her produce is organic and doesn\u2019t harm the environment as she uses artisanal techniques to take care of her crops. Ana knows that her children will take over the business in the future.  So, of course she is teaching them how to properly manage and care for their plantations while preserving the environment at the same time. Her produce is recognized in her community for its good quality.  That is why the big wholesalers come to her farm to buy it and offer her a competitive price. Usually she works with her partner, but sometimes she gets help from her children.  However at harvest time, she needs laborers to assist in the gathering of her crops.

She lives in the majestic Cusco jungle, in the community of Manitea Alta, where she has her own wooden home. Blanca's only priority is getting ahead, and for this reason she has fully devoted herself to agriculture, specifically the production and sale of coffee. Bit by bit her sales have been progressing in a sustainable manner, to the point that, since her land wouldn't let her farm in large quantities, she had to buy from other producers to meet her customers' demand. She feels that she has a long way to go, and so she plans to increase her productivity and improve the quality of her coffee in order to earn a better income.

Together, the family lives in the community of Manitea Alta, located in the beautiful forest near Cuzco, where they have their own home constructed of wood.  Twenty-eight years ago, Fernandina began running her own business, which she learned with the help of his parents.  Since then, she has advanced the business day by day, making sure her business selling cocoa and coffee is both up-to-par with her competitors and built to last.  Fernandina is very thankful to her husband, whose unconditional support has helped her overcome difficult times her business has undergone.  Now, she sells her products in various localities, through which she has extended her market base, but she has not caught her business up yet to serve these areas well.  Also, she has not been able to attend many of the education talks on improving agriculture-based businesses, which she would love to attend so that she could share the tips with her family.  Usually she enjoys the help of her parents, but during harvest season she also needs farm workers to help her facilitate the extraction of the final product.  Generally, she sells her products in centers where these products are stockpiled to be sold at a low price for commercial use.  In the future, Fernandina yearns to grow her products to be sold in more strategically-located communities for the purpose of minimizing time and expenses.

Each day, after carrying out the household chores, she starts working in her business. She makes women's jackets and sweaters, of a variety of types.  Some of her customers are teachers in the neighborhood, to whom she gives credit.  She sells to the rest of her neighbors on a cash basis.  She carries out this activity during the afternoons, and in the mornings she does collections.  What she likes most about her business is that it doesn't take up all of her time.  She has already spent 3 years doing this work, and what she considers most difficult is to make the purchases, because it's hard for her to select the right garments, since she must take into account the tastes of her customers.  For the future she has plans to expand her business and buy more glass display cases.  This is her 10th loan with MFP, and she confirms her commitment to continue making her payments on time.  She is a very responsible woman who is concerned for the well-being and development of her group, since she wants all of the members to get ahead.

She started out setting up a small table in her front yard where she sold chicharrones (fried pork rinds), juices, soft-drinks and candy to her neighbors among whom she is well known throughout the community.  She used to use part of the weekly money her husband would give her but subsequently started to reinvest her earnings into the business.  She set up a small stand that Coca-Cola provided for her and gradually built the locale that she\u2019s been in for the last two years.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested funds exclusively for stock items for her store so that it will be better stocked because she states that even though she is well known in the area she has competition and sometimes she has too few items available to sell.

Her husband earns money sporadically as a hired laborer which makes maintaining a cash flow for the family a great challenge on which Salvacion has to work every day. She realized that her dream of having her children graduate from college for a better career in the future was starting to fade because of insufficient income. With that realisation, she gained more courage and determination.  \r\n\r\n<p>Salvacion joined ASHI in 2009 and requested a loan to finance starting up her own business. At first, she bought and sold fruit and vegetables from their small village.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celestina A., aged 57, is from the village of Punta Sulong. She is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if either is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCelestina is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling piglets. Celestina has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities. She is also engaged in fish selling.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Celestina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC which was used as additional capital for raising pigs. Celestina is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used as additional capital for fish selling. This will be the 17th loan she has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her standard of living. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":548633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

B. is from the village of Guinabot. She is 48 years old, married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Alma owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling copra from her own cocoland. Alma has been managing her cocoland for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,800 PHP a month from these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Alma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC which was used as additional capital for her business. Alma is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to redeem her pawned cocoland. This will be the sixth loan she has taken out from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 59 years old and is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Felicidad O. Group.\r\n\r\nFelicidad is widowed. She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 4,600 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Felicidad joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital.\r\n\r\nFelicidad is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her 2nd from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Regina, aged 34 years, is an example. She is a happy-go-lucky single lady with one child who has relied on a produce sales business for four years to earn her livelihood. Ever since she opened up her now growing business, she has been mostly selling dry food crops like peas, beans, maize, millet and sorghum in Kabanda trading center, Mubende.\r\n\r\nRegina\u2019s farming background has helped her a lot, in that she can predict and know exactly the seasons when certain crops are likely to sell more or less. In that way she has minimized losses. She also had prior experience working in a hardware retail shop.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time, Regina has reached a stage where she makes monthly profits totaling up to 200,000 shillings. This loan is to help her buy more bags of produce to sell. This will enable her to earn more revenue to cater for her family's basic needs and also to acquire a self-sustaining life.\r\n\r\nRegina also ekes out profits from a rental business and this serves

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow ten times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her dried fish business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan to be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying more dried fish.

This is her second loan with the \"Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\", organization that has helped her expand her stock, especially in terms of furniture which is more expensive than clothing.

She and her husband, Mr. Cham Roeun Sem, are farmers who own a 1.3-hectare plot of land where they can grow rice to sell to support their family. Their problem is that it is time to plant the field but they do not have money to support it.

Having been prevailed upon by his wife, M. Richard began his business three years ago in Rwenshama, Rukungiri. He has mostly been selling sugarcane, sweet bananas, charcoal, tomatoes and onions. This business has been bringing him earnings amounting to 100,000 Ugandan shillings on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nBeing a married father of six lively children made this 44-year-old come to terms with the fact that he needed to work extra hard to improve his family's welfare. With his cultivated hard-work ethic, he has been able to cater for his family's requirements, including meeting the school fees for his children\u2019s education. That has all been made possible with finances from his business.\r\n\r\nBefore he began this business, Richard was more inclined to farming. He still derives side profits from his small scale coffee-sales business.\r\n\r\nThis loan will enable Richard to expand his business through the purchase of more crops like sweet bananas, thus increasing his supplying capacity to his increasing clientele.

All the members have selected Mrs. Vannak K. as the group leader. She was born in 1977. Her position is a farmer. She owns a half-hectare plot of land to cultivate rice to support her family. Her husband, Mr. Srun Soa, is a government worker. Although they try to work hard, they can't earn enough income. So to improve their family living conditions, Mrs. Vannak K. is applying for a loan to buy some piglets and pig food to start a new business breeding pigs. She is a mother of five children.

Stephen, aged 38 years, has a family of six children. He has been operating a retail shop in Omwirwaniraniro trading center, Rukungiri, for over seven years. He has, for the most part, been trading in a variety of products for domestic use like sugar, soap, salt and cooking oil. His wife, has been at his beck and call all this while as he beat all odds to gradually establish himself.\r\n\r\nWith savings from his much older farming business, Stephen made up his mind to start this retail business. He has never lived to regret his decision as his profits have been increasing every passing month. At present, he makes 400,000 Ugandan shillings on a monthly basis. And with confidence, he says his hard work is a trump card to earning more money in the future.\r\n\r\nStephen\u2019s main drawback in the course of operating has, however, been that he has been limited in terms of the variety of products he sells. He is therefore looking at increasing the array of stock for his business when he gets this loan and is also looking at expanding into a wholesale enterprise.\r\n\r\nStephen wants to purchase more general merchandise like maize flour, beans, salt, sugar, etc. This, he envisions, will help him earn more revenue and thereby lay a firm foundation for future success.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":550972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more retail items like maize flour, beans, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":324999.99,"processed_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":329546.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903483,"comment":null},{"amount":78.07,"local_amount":176500.01,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":178969.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744604,"comment":null},{"amount":62.3,"local_amount":140850,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":142820.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482816,"comment":null},{"amount":81.47,"local_amount":184200,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":186777.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352116,"comment":null},{"amount":62.3,"local_amount":140850,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":142820.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211293810,"comment":null},{"amount":147.11,"local_amount":332600,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":337253.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216574395,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-23T11:13:19Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:47:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206446,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epifania B., 60, is committed to making sure that her family has enough provisions to meet their daily needs and can live a better life.

A., 65, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs. She makes sure that she earns well so her brood of five can have a better life.  She has been managing her own dried fish business for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nBonifacia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her dried fish business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan.

Baroat is a married woman with three children. She started her business as the result of economic pressure. Her husband's salary was not enough to meet their family expenses, so Baroat began to investigate what work she could do. About 4 years ago, one of her friends recommended that she sell women\u2019s clothing, so she decided to try it. Little by little she brought in more clients, which increased her income, since her commissions increased as she sold more clothing. Baroat is applying for a loan of $1500 USD to buy merchandise and fill existing client orders. She hopes that you will collaborate with her. Along with her family, Baroat thanks you for supporting them and helping the family move ahead.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a  23-year-old businessman. Since he was young, he has had a passion for technology and computers. Shuhrat trained as much as he could and, with a lot of effort, finished his education. Two years ago, he started a small Internet caf\u00e9. It offers services such as renting computers, making international and domestic calls, and photocopying. Shuhrat is at his store every day of the week as he is in charge of the business. \r\n\r\n<p>Right now, the Internet caf\u00e9 needs an expansion in order to offer fax and scanner services and a small bookstore where the customers, mainly high school and college students, can meet when they need to. Shuhrat is requesting a loan to be able to purchase the necessary equipment and materials to offer his customers these services that are so much in demand.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is married and is the father of an 11-year-old daughter who attends school. He himself went through 6th grade but did not continue because his parents lacked the funds. He lives in a rented home and he also supports his brother, who lives with him. <p>\r\n\r\nHe has never left the city he was born in. He has worked for more than 5 years in the Hotel Xisaka, which is in the Namaacha district, as a maintenance technician. He has no employees and makes a monthly salary of 3,000MT, which he uses to pay for his expenses and even saves some to his bank account. <p>\r\n\r\nHe has never taken out a loan with another bank. He came to know Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the institution. This is his fourth loan, for the amount of 20,000MT. He plans to use this amount to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, stone, blocks, etc.) to continue his work. The previous loans were for 3,500MT, 5,000MT and 15,000MT and were used for housing as well. He promises to make his repayments dutifully so that he can access loans in the future, in order to furnish his home. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

Road in Rukungiri town. Before she obtained a footing in her current business, she was operating a stationery shop.\r\n\r\nAll along, however, U. Doreen, a married mother of four, had been nursing a dream to start a clothes boutique. A business like this, she knew, requires good customer relationship skills and Doreen has strived to achieve success in that regard, in the course of time. Experienced decision making has also been her other success attribute.\r\n\r\nProfits have been steadily accruing to Doreen\u2019s business and, at present, her weekly profits stand at 200,000 shillings.

He is married and is the father of 4 children.  The two oldest are 14 year old twins, and the other children are 12 and 3 years of age.  Three of them attend school.  Milion studied through the 12th grade, but did not continue due to a lack of resources.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports his mother by sending her money to use for household expenses.\r\n\r\nMilion left Lichinga for Maputo with his brother in order to continue his studies.  He has worked as an advisor and a data manager for Doctors of the World [M\u00e9dicos do Mundo\/M\u00e9dicins du Monde, a non-governmental organization] for over 8 years.  He makes 17,500 MZN per month--equivalent to $700 USD--, which he uses to pay for household expenses and his own work.  He saves some in his bank account, although he is not always able to because he has to pay for his wife's college expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is Milion's third loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva.  It has a value of 15,000 MZN, which he will use to legalize the land attached to his other property.  The previous loans, both for 15,000 MZN, were used to buy construction material for the work.  He is sure that he will be able to pay back the loan without any problems and ask for another one in order to erect a house on the land to be legalized.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

is a 50-year-old lady married to a mechanic with a family of six children; they live in Masindi, Uganda. She says she pays the school fees for her children with a dream that they all will be educated up to university.

They live together on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, in the community of Manitea Alta, where they have their own wooden house. For the past 20 years, Hilda has worked in agriculture, growing and selling cocoa. She recalls that she began with only a small parcel of land, which only served to cover her own consumption. Today, she produces and sells on a significant scale, dealing with large wholesalers, and in this way she obtains excellent economic returns. \n\nShe saved her profits and thus was also able to open a small grocery store with the aim of satisfying her customers' needs. In the future, Hilda hopes to expand both her grocery store and her cocoa fields, with the aim of attracting more customers and positioning herself better in the market. Toward this aim, she works tirelessly on her business. For the moment, she runs her store herself, though she occasionally receives help from her parentr. At harvest time, she needs assistance from hired laborers to get the work done and help transport the crops to the warehouses where they are sold. This is Hilda's fifth loan with MFP, and she is committed to continue being punctual with her payments. She feels well-supported by her communal bank group. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy merchandise to stock her store, so that she can satisfy the tastes and preferences of her customers. \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":551627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying products to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3062.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326785,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-18T12:10:57Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206506,"name":"El Sol Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En uno de los Centros Focales de Pro Mujer, Panamericana, se re\u00fanen cada dos semanas la  Asociaci\u00f3n Comunal EL SOL.

She is married and has 6 children (4 boys and 2 girls), 4 at the local school and 2 still at home.  Antonia raises grain crops.  She also operates a taxi business ferrying passengers between the towns of Antacancha and Lircay.  She started her first business selling cheese and eggs when she was very young.  Her problem has always been a lack of capital to invest in her businesses.  She is now happy to be a FINCA member because she will learn how to save.  She also likes not having to depend solely on her husband.  Antonia needs a loan so that she can buy barley and wheat that she will process at a local mill and then sell in Lima.

In order to further expand his business, Ray has requested another loan. This loan would allow him hire a temporary worker, add a store-like function to his website, and add money for working capital. Ray is expecting to close a deal soon which would require an extra worker and additional supplies to fulfill the order. \r\n\r\nRay plans to continue expanding his business by partnering with larger companies and expanding his market base. With purchasing options on his website, he expects to gain more customers and boost sales. As his company grows, he will hire more workers and empower the hard-working men and women in his community.\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":547655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Hiring

This extra income helps, with her husband's income, to move the project along.  Over the years, they have been working on the framing, walls and roof of their much-desired house.

He eventually managed to buy his own farm where he grows cocoa and coffee.  His output has steadily increased and he now sells his crop to the large wholesaleers and warehouses in his town, an advantage because he can get a better price.  He normally works on his own but he hires laborers to help him during the planting and harvesting seasons.

They live together in the community of Manitea Alta, located in the beautiful Cuzque\u00f1an rainforest, where they have their own house made of wood.  Nineteen years ago Victor did not have capital to invest in a business, but thanks to the help of his family he was able to establish himself in the cultivation of cocoa.  At times he receives help from his family, but at harvest time he hires and supervises workers who help him with the harvest of his product.   Now he has found a niche in the market, and for this reason the production of this fruit is generating a good income for him.  But he is aware that there is much that he lacks to be able to grow.  For this reason, he has an ambitious plan, so that he will be able to meet the needs of his customers.  His plan is to buy land to cultivate other products that are in high demand.

","en":"Elvira, age 52, is a very hard-working woman. She lives in her own house together with her husband and her young daughter, Mery. Elvira has a little store installed on a mobile cart, from which she sells snacks and signs. Her neighbors are her customers. Her husband is an expert in painting signs. The inscriptions mention the bus routes, and the people who buy these signs are the drivers and assistants on the bus lines serving the area. Previously, she and her husband both painted the signs, but now Elvira dedicates herself in the mornings to buying her snacks, to make sure her wagon will be well-stocked and attractive to her customers. She has done this work for 5 years; although she feels that the business can be a bit tedious, she doesn't complain, because she obtains good economic returns. Her greatest desire is to expand her business and later to acquire a permanent kiosk, so that her store will be more stable. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and she knows that it will benefit her greatly by increasing her working capital. She is committed to making her payments on time, and she is known within her work group for being serious and responsible. Elvira plans to invest the funds she is requesting in buying a larger quantity of snacks, as well as acrylic paints, to improve her business, and she says that if there is any money left over, she will invest it in improving her wagon.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

P. is a young man with a strong work ethic; everything he\u2019s accomplished has been due to his good behavior, discipline and self-control.  As a good citizen of Santander, at his young age he already owns a grocery store.  He lives with his father and sisters who are 13 and 23 years of age.  He came to the Caribbean coast region looking for better opportunities and started working in a bakery.  Having learned those skills, he sought to become independent.  The owner of the bakery, recognizing Richar\u2019s sense of responsibility, lent him the initial $200.000 pesos and later an additional $10.000.000 pesos.  This is how he was able to bring his father from north Santander and they began to work in their own store after the illness and death of his mother.  Currently, each tends to his business.\r\n\r\nThis is his 2nd loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He used the first one to pay down several of his debts; thanks to God everything has normalized now.  With this capital input he was able to pay cash to his suppliers which guaranteed lower prices and allowed him to be competitive in the marketplace.  This is why Richar is now applying for a $1.800.000 pesos loan; he wants to pay cash for most of his merchandise like: rice, coffee, cooking oil, canned goods, beverages and soft-drinks.\r\n\r\nHis future dream includes owning his own home, helping out his family, and carving out some free time to go to school to continue preparing himself.  However, what he would most like is to find ways to relax and enjoy himself because currently all he does is work.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":551631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay cash for most of his stock merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-06-11T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richar Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1800000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":162715},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":168134},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":171356},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":174641},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":177988},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":181399},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":184876},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":188420},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":192031},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":198440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.47},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.62,"local_amount":162715,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":164224.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636221,"comment":null},{"amount":86.4,"local_amount":168134,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":169693.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850316,"comment":null},{"amount":88.06,"local_amount":171356,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":172945.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117074,"comment":null},{"amount":89.74,"local_amount":174641,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":176261.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410942,"comment":null},{"amount":91.47,"local_amount":177988,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":179639.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550600,"comment":null},{"amount":93.22,"local_amount":181399,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":183081.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688202,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":184876,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":186591.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427436,"comment":null},{"amount":96.83,"local_amount":188420,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":190168.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000854,"comment":null},{"amount":98.68,"local_amount":192031,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":193812.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288862,"comment":null},{"amount":101.98,"local_amount":198440,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":200281.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157020,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T06:59:38Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206526,"name":"Deylin Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Deylin Francisco tiene 25 a\u00f1os, es casado y tiene un hijo menor de edad.
