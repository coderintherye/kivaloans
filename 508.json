Three months ago, Husna started her own food vending business to support herself and her child. The business offers ready-made food from 06:00 am until 08:00 pm and earns her a low monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Husna's first loan with Tujijenge Tanzania. She aims to use the loan to increase her stock of certain basic supplies such as rice, flour and cooking oil. By buying this in bulk, she will also be able to get favorable prices.

She is a very hard-working mother who lives in her own home with her husband and 2 children.  Rosa sells very well-known brands of cosmetics throughout the streets of her district.  After finishing her housework, she visits her family members, friends and neighbors to whom she sells these beauty products, taking advantage of offers.  She has been working in this way for more than 10 years and she feels very satisfied with the good profits that she makes.  She feels even more satisfied when her customers pay on time.\r\n\r\nIn the future Rosa plans to set up a stall in a market in her district or in her home so that she can improve and diversify her sales and increase her profits since her goal is to provide her children with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosa's 17th loan from MFP.

From a very early age she has worked in a number of occupations to provide the best education for her son, who is her main motivation.  She sells hamburgers from a door in her house from the afternoons until late in the evening, when her son also helps her.  In addition, in the morning hours she sells beauty products, a business that is going very well, since she offers these products to the regular customers who come to her food stand.  She feels content doing both of these jobs, because she very much enjoys interacting with her customers.  In the future, she will expand her business to include the sale of lunches and thereby boost her income.

Her main source of revenue is her garment business, but she involves herself with both activities in order to maintain a steady stream of income. Guisselle has been working in this capacity for the past eight years.  Her revenue generating activities have helped her to provide for her children.\r\n\r\nThis will be Guisselle's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Guisselle decided to apply for a loan after completing a capacity building course in business administration at the Foundation.  With this loan, Guisselle plans to make investments in both of her productive activities. Specifically, she plans to buy different colors of high quality wool and make repairs to her weaving machine by replacing the cones.  She also plans to use the loan to purchase balloons and party decorations. Currently Guiselle has pending orders in both of her activities.  She lacks sufficient working capital in order to make investments, which would enable her to satisfy the demands of her clients. This loan will help to address this obstacle. \r\n\r\nWith two children and a home to take care of, Guisselle is busy most days until 3 PM. She dedicates the hours between 3 and 6 to weaving.

Guisselle\u00b4s long-term goal is to fulfill her business plan, which includes generating sufficient revenues from her productive activities in order to open a weaving workshop and a gift shop. As mentioned, the main factor inhibiting the growth of her business is a lack of access to working capital.

Amalia, the treasurer of the group, is 40, studied secondary school and now works selling shoes and dressmaking. Amalia has 9 children, 6 girls and 3 boys. She is seeking a loan to invest in purchasing merchandise and primary materials - threads, yarn, hooks etc. She hopes with this investment in her business to obtain utilities that permit her children to finish their studies, and also hopes that each one of her children achieves success in life and becomes a stable family base. The example Amalia gives is that of never giving in to defeat and working hard to obtain what you plan to.

She is a very kind and responsible mother who is separated and lives together with her son, Cesar, 30, together in their own home. Antonia has always worked in business, beginning by selling clothes in an informal way travelling the streets of the market. Now, after several years, she sells fruit in a small airconditioned space in her house. This business is doing very well, owing to the earnings that she generates. Antonia always goes to the wholesale markets to stock her shop with fresh fruit, and in this way captures more customers. She has been doing this for a year, and has managed to become very well known and loved by her customers and people in her neighbourhood.

He started with a vacant property and in three years, using his own work and savings, he made it into a store.

His daily sales come to between $600 and $700. He can put about 15% of that amount towards offsetting his fixed costs, and he keeps a good level of inventory. He would like to expand his business to include the sale of cold drinks, buying them wholesale and then selling them to potential clients such as small stores, restaurant owners, and soft drink stands. These clients typically cannot buy in large quantities and so when they run out of provisions they have to wait to put in an order, and the delays in distribution cause them to lose business. Gregorio hopes to be able to sell drinks to these clients directly from his store, thus providing them with faster service. This will be another opportunity for him to increase his earnings.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, which is his first through Kiva, he will buy rice, cooking oil, and grains, as well as soft drinks and other drinks in larger quantities.

Pero un d\u00eda unas amigas  le hablaron de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y  se interes\u00f3  y con 3 amigas   conformaron  el grupo  solidario Las Kenesianas y recibieron su primer  cr\u00e9dito de $60.000.oo COP para pagarlos en 4 cuotas. Con este dinero compr\u00f3 mercanc\u00eda y le dio m\u00e1s impulso a su   negocio, por lo cual considera que \u201cpagar con puntualidad las cuotas pactadas y no quedar mal es primordial para seguir adelante apoyada por esta organizaci\u00f3n, o por quienes le den la mano\u201d. Su negocio ha sido un pelda\u00f1o importante para su  vida y la de su familia, porque todos han puesto su granito de arena para sacarlo adelante. En el  negocio Gladys vende papeler\u00eda, detalles, ropa de ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as, peque\u00f1os electrodom\u00e9sticos, refrescos, cervezas y con sus ganancias ha logrado ayudar a formar profesionalmente a su hija hasta terminar su carrera de Contadur\u00eda P\u00fablica como tambi\u00e9n a mejorar las condiciones de su vivienda.    Gladys   se siente  muy contenta ella goza  d\u00e1ndole gracias a Dios y a la Fundaci\u00f3n por los beneficio recibidos y la confianza de esta al otorgarle prestamos consecutivos a los largo de 18 a\u00f1os, por su  buen manejo de responsabilidad y sentido de pertenencia.  Gladys considera que a lo largo  de todos estos a\u00f1os, la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo ha sido muy enriquecedora con sus capacitaciones y su apoyo econ\u00f3mico para el crecimiento y el buen manejo del negocio, tanto en la parte espiritual como material, porque esto le ha servido para encontrarse en paz con Dios y expresar agradecimientos a  la fundaci\u00f3n, y a  las personas que de una u otra forma le han colaborado para que los resultados sean positivos. Con los cursos de formaci\u00f3n microempresarial en los que ha participado, aprendi\u00f3 a distinguir entre clientes buenos y malos, as\u00ed como mercanc\u00edas que son m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de vender y otras no, a ser ordenada con los recaudos y a tener una visi\u00f3n  diferente con respecto a los proveedores, ya que no es muy partidaria de adquirir mercanc\u00edas a cr\u00e9dito, sino comprarlas con el efectivo por lo que manifiesta que le deja un mayor margen de utilidad.\nEn la actualidad ha logrado conformar en sociedad una Cooperativa Multiactiva que se encuentra legalizada en la c\u00e1mara de comercio, producto de los conocimientos adquiridos en el largo recorrido de su carrera como microempresaria, y de los  ofrecidos por la fundaci\u00f3n que han sido muy importante y de  apoyo para alcanzar  sus metas y consolidar este , su proyecto de vida.  \nGladys es una mujer trabajadora y carism\u00e1tica que se desempe\u00f1a como docente en un Hogar Infantil,  ubicado en sur occidente de la ciudad donde se atienden Ni\u00f1os de escasos recursos. De su grupo inicial \u201c Las Kenesianas\u201d la \u00fanica que ha permanecido consecutivamente es   Gladys, porque es persistente y disciplinada, ella es una mujer felizmente realizada y a punto de recibir su  pensi\u00f3n.\nEn la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su credikiva que es el financiamiento n\u00famero 22 y con el piensa comprar mercanc\u00edas para surtir su negocio en la \u00e9poca mas linda porque concentra a la familia en su hogar con festividades mientras lucen vestidos, calzados, accesorios y perfumes que Gladys vende a cr\u00e9dito y de contado.\nSu desaf\u00edo y meta principal es dedicarse completamente a la cooperativa multiactiva, as\u00ed  como tambi\u00e9n a su familia y a sus nietos, futuros herederos del negocio que con mucha disciplina, esfuerzo y trabajo ha levantado.\n \n\n\n\n","en":"Gladys Narva\u00e9z is a very active and dynamic person who likes business a lot.  This is a characteristic of her ancestors and she learned it almost instinctively.  Gladys is a saleswoman.  Initially she sold merchandise which her work colleagues and employees of other businesses ordered.  She also performed sewing tasks, her speciality being making clothes for little girls.  This period was very difficult for her because her two children were young and her income was very small.  However, one day some friends talked to her about Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she became interested.  Together with three friends, she set up the 'Las Kenesianas' solidarity group and they received their first loan for 60,000 Colombian pesos which was to be repaid over 4 instalments.  With this money, she bought merchandise and it gave her business a boost.  She considers that \u201cpaying your instalments punctually and not making a bad impression is essential if you want to continue to get ahead with the support of this organization or those who are giving you a hand\u201d.  \r\n\r\nGladys' business has been an important stepping stone in her life and that of her family because everybody has done their bit to get her business ahead.  In her business, Gladys sells stationery, notions, boys' and girls' clothing, small domestic appliances, soft drinks, beer and, with her profits, she has managed to help train her daughter professionally until she finished her course in Public Accountancy.  It has also helped her to improve the condition of her home.  Gladys feels very happy.  She gives thanks to God and Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the benefits which she has received and the trust that the organization has placed in her by giving her consecutive loans for 18 years, for their good management, responsibility and sense of belonging.  Gladys considers that throughout all these years, being a part of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has been a very enriching experience with their training programs and their financial support.  They have helped her business to grow and helped her to manage it well, both spiritually and materially.  This has helped her to find herself at peace with God and she is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and the people who in one way or another have contributed to her positive results.  Through the small business courses which she has participated in, she has learned to distinguish between good customers and bad customers as well as between goods which are easy to sell and others which are not.  She is now organized in her accounts and has a different view with respect to her providers since she is no longer a fan of acquiring goods on credit, rather she prefers to buy in cash because she says that this gives her a bigger profit margin.\r\n\r\nShe has currently managed to form a Multiactive Cooperative which has been legalized in the Chamber of Commerce.  This is a product of the knowledge which she has acquired throughout her long career as a small businesswoman.  The training she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has been very important and has supported her so that she can achieve her goals and consolidate her life's project.\r\n\r\nGladys is a hard-working and charismatic woman who works as a teacher in a child development center located in the south-west of the city where she looks after children whose parents have low economic means.  From her initial 'Las Kenesianas' group, the only one who has remained consecutively is Gladys because she is persistent and disciplined.  She is a woman who feels happily fulfilled and is about to receive her pension.  She is currently applying for her Kiva loan, which is her 22nd loan, and plans to use it to buy merchandise to stock her business in this period of the year which is the most beautiful because she gets her family together in her home and gets to enjoy the festive season while everyone shows off dresses, shoes, accessories and perfumes which Gladys sells on credit and for cash.\r\n\r\nGlady's challenge and main goal is to dedicate herself entirely to the multiactive cooperative as well as to her family and her grandchildren who are the future heirs to her business which she has built up with a lot of discipline, effort and hard work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":656909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy merchandise

es muy usual encontrar en su negocio  vitaminas, Omega 3 entre otros productos  como fantas\u00edas, cosm\u00e9ticos, aunque tambi\u00e9n vende calzado y ropa interior y para ni\u00f1os. Ella inici\u00f3 este negocio puerta a puerta  en el a\u00f1o 2004 entusiasmada por su c\u00f3nyuge,  que se dedica a la litograf\u00eda y  haciendo trabajos a los laboratorios conoci\u00f3 los que hoy son los  proveedores de Ruth Mar\u00eda y a los que  inici\u00f3 compr\u00e1ndole  $200.000 COP,   en productos naturales como los ya mencionados;    gradualmente  Ruth ha ido adicionando otros art\u00edculos, como ropa, fantas\u00edas, cosm\u00e9ticos y casi todo lo que sus clientes necesitan para su vida diaria, porque ha  aprovechado efectivamente  la gran clientela que se desprendi\u00f3 de su negocio inicial de venta de productos naturales. Sus principales clientes, son los habitantes del barrio y muchos referidos de estos en  otras comunidades; Ruth Mar\u00eda es una muy buena empresaria que les acredita  a sus clientes  solo lo que ellos pueden pagar  y en los plazos acordados, por eso recupera su cartera semanalmente y algunos en cada quincena. Ella compra de contado y adquiere frecuentemente descuentos, porque sus proveedores la conocen muy bien y a su vez sabe como negociar sus compras. Su margen de contribuci\u00f3n es del 40%   con respecto a los productos naturales,  recupera esta  inversi\u00f3n con la primera cuota, pero regularmente las  divide en 4   plazos de pago de acuerdo a cada cliente y tambi\u00e9n hace algunas excepciones con un peque\u00f1o n\u00famero de sus compradores ofreci\u00e9ndoles plazos especiales un poco m\u00e1s largos,  pero no muy usuales.  Relacionado con la mercanc\u00eda que distribuye su margen de contribuci\u00f3n  es de 45% y los planea con sus clientes en 2 cuotas. Su sue\u00f1o ahora es tener un punto de ventas en un sitio estrat\u00e9gico, pero sabe que se requiere un capital inicial importante y por eso est\u00e1 trabajando fuertemente para lograrlo. Con su Credikiva que es su primer financiamiento comprar\u00e1 productos naturales que tiene encargados por sus clientes y tambi\u00e9n jeans, calzado, ropa interior y especialmente vestidos para ni\u00f1os, teniendo en cuenta que en las fiestas los padres de familia vestir\u00e1n a sus peque\u00f1os con nueva ropa y estos a su vez lucir\u00e1n los vestidos de Ruth Mar\u00eda con mucha alegr\u00eda y distinci\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Ruth Mar\u00eda N. lives in Soledad\u2019s Los Almendros neighborhood where she sells natural products and assorted merchandise.  It is quite usual to find vitamins and Omega 3 among other products like costume jewelry, and cosmetics in her store.  She also sells footwear, underwear and children\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\nShe started the business around 2004 encouraged by her spouse to do so.  He is a lithographer and while doing jobs for laboratories he got to know the people who today are Ruth Maria\u2019s suppliers and from whom he originally bought $200,000COP worth of natural products like the ones already mentioned.\r\n\r\nGradually Ruth has been adding other items like: clothes, jewelry, cosmetics and almost everything else customers need in their daily lives because she\u2019s known how to take advantage of the vast clientele that her initial natural products business generated. Her main customers are residents of the neighborhood and referrals from them who live in other areas.\r\n\r\nRuth Mar\u00eda is quite a good businesswoman who floats her customers just the amount of credit they are able to repay in the time agreed upon.  Thus she recovers her outstanding debts weekly and some biweekly. She, however, pays cash so often gets discounts because her suppliers know her well and she is very good at negotiating her purchases.\r\n\r\nHer recovery margin on the natural products is 40% and she usually gets that back on the first installment.  However, she splits up the amount into four installments according to the customer and sometimes makes exceptions for some customers giving them still longer repayment schedules; but this isn\u2019t too common.  The other merchandise has a 45% margin and that she recovers in two installments.\r\n\r\nHer dream now is to have a point of sale in some strategic location but she knows she needs an important injection of capital to do so.  This is why she\u2019s working so hard to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, which is her first loan, she will buy natural products that she has pending orders for as well as jeans, footwear, underwear and especially children\u2019s clothes keeping in mind that during the festive season that\u2019s approaching parents will dress up their children in new outfits and the children will sport Ruth Maria\u2019s outfits with much cheer and distinction.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":655242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"She will

J. is 46 years old, married and supports her family by operating two business ventures: Internet & Computer games and buying and selling mineral water. She lives in Basak Merkado, Brgy. Basak, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her Internet & Computer games and buying and selling mineral water businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000. Lolita is now borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase new equipment. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lolita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in Lapu-Lapu st., Poblacion, Madredijos, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: general store, buying and selling chicken, and dried fish.  Her husband, Lopito C., who is 60 years old, works as a driver\/mechanic to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have eight children who are between 19 and 36 years old. Norie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Norie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to save up for the future for her business operations.

With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melanie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

B. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Camburong, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a pig fattening and motorcycle business. Her husband, Onesimo B., who is 54 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have six children who are between 11 and 30 years old. One of them has a family, while three others are working to help out in the house, and the youngest two go to school. Marcelina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. Marcelina B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marcelina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she wants to borrow PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and support the family's needs. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

L. is a 36-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two businesses: vegetable farming and food vending. She lives in Brgy. Cagubaan, Alegria, Cebu. \r\n\r\nJosefina has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with both the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard on her vegetable farm and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000.  \r\n\r\nJosefina wants to borrow PHP 13,000 so that she can purchase new equipment. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom. Josefina hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

L. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Valencia, Alegria, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a farm. Her husband Romulo L., who is 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have three children who are between 20 and 25 years old--two of them are already working while one is currently going to school. \r\n\r\nLeona joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leona has been lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she wants to borrow PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to expand her business so that she can continue to save up for the future and their family's needs. Leona L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

L. is a widow who lives in Brgy. Valencia, Alegria, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two businesses: a general store and video rental. She has three children who are between 30 and 38 years old. \r\n\r\nRomula joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Romula has been lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she hopes to borrow PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock to sell. Romula L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

O. is a 59-year-old married man who supports his family through his business of buying and selling livestock.  He lives in Badian, Cebu.  He has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved his living conditions with the help of his loans from NWTF and through his own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in his livestock  business, Gaudencio is gradually making his family more economically stable. He now earns an average monthly income of PHP7,000. Gaudencio is borrowing PHP 12,000 to  fund his business operations. This will be his ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. His previous loan of PHP10,000, which he paid off well within its term, was just another step in his journey towards economic freedom. Gaudencio aspires to elevate his family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering people to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

 A. is a married woman who lives in Barangay Bugas, Badian, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: a general store, a haircut business and a manicure business. Her husband Deocito A. helps her with her businesses.  The couple has 2 children who are 9 and 11 years old and are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nEvangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell.  With increased profits, she will be able to continue to save for the future and her children's education.  Evangeline  A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband is a construction worker, but is currently unemployed. \r\n\r\nAltanzul operates a consumer goods trading business out of a rented stall at the local market in her town. In 2007, she moved to her current town and started her business after operating a repair shop in a rented space in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, between 2000 and 2007. Over the years, she has gained significant business experience and has built a positive reputation amongst her customers and suppliers. Her product procurement usually depends on the season, therefore she provides a variety of products that can satisfy her customers. After years of successful operation, she was able to build a house in her yard. For the future, Altanzul hopes to continue being successful with her business and enlarge her house. She has used her business earnings to pay for her daughter's school costs, which has caused her working capital to decrease. She is requesting a 2,500,000 MNT loan in order to increase her goods and also working capital for her business.

Herders travel up to 200 kilometers from their location to sell livestock to the meat wholesale trader in the town. In Bayan-Ulgii province, it is common for a household to buy at least one cow and 10 sheep to be eaten during the long Mongolian winters. People of this province usually prepare their meats for winter during October and November and finish those prepared meats in March. Amantai usually purchases livestock from herders and slaughters them to sell their meat at the local market. She sells a kilogram of lamb for 4,000 to 4,500 MNT and horse meat for 4,000 to 4,500 MNT, respectively. She hopes to continue her success and says, \"all I want is to support my children.\" Amantai is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT loan to purchase more livestock at wholesale prices. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":657152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more livestock at wholesale prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Bayan-Ulgii","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-12-04T00:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amantai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.04,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T15:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":125039.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188764903,"comment":null},{"amount":2323.96,"local_amount":2875000,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T01:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2875898.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191613727,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-06T18:21:54Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T01:40:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":254759,"name":"Kalira Echkilbaeva's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kalira E. is the leader of this group.

can still be found for someone who has lost the single most important person in her life. A widow at the age of 58, Jelly F. has learned this truth in a rather painful way. Her beloved husband is gone. Jelly finished only high school and has no children to support her. But, a hope still stands beside her. A reason for living has come along when it seemed that nothing was left to live for. Jelly is living not just for herself, but for the people around her whose health and lives she is enriching with the business that she runs. \r\n\r\nJelly is a CCT* community partner who gains and applies her entrepreneurial training in managing her fruits and vegetables business. She treats this business a treasured thing in life to which she dedicates her effort and resources. She sells healthy foods to people in her community, spreading the wealth of good health to people whose needs she is striving to meet. With this business, Jelly earns Php 9,000 every month, which she uses to meet her daily needs.\r\n\r\nJelly is requesting a loan of Php 9,000 to help her grow her business. She intends to use the money to purchase more fruits and vegetables to add to her table of goods for sale.

Criselda only finished high school, but despite that, she strives to excel in everything she puts her hands into. Criselda is married to Roman, who presently has no work. For now, Criselda takes the responsibility of earning money to meet the needs of their children. Together, they presently live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nCriselda has managed a sari-sari (variety) store for 10 years now. Alongside her variety store is a small food stall where she basically sells rice and viands (tasty dishes) for her neighborhood. The fact that her store stands near a cemetery in Pasay City speaks of her determination to keep her small business running. Training and Bible studies in CCT* enable Criselda to stand firm on what she knows is right and profitable in business not just for herself but also for others around her. Family members assist Criselda in managing the sari-sari store and food stall. Every month, they earn an average of 7,000 Philippines pesos (Php).\r\n\r\nTo further help her grow her business, Criselda applied for a Php13,000 loan. She intends to use this money to add more items to her store and make sure her customers, who are mostly visitors to the cemetery, will find what they need in her store. Definitely, Criselda desires to make her business grow and see to it that it would be profitable for her and her family's benefit.\r\n\r\nThe times when the store has low sales challenge Criselda, as well as debts from her customers that have yet to be paid. She is also worried about her children, who get naughty and need some discipline. Nevertheless, she is determined to overcome these trials and emerge better than she was before, and higher from where she was before. Because, more than a driven entrepreneur, she is a persistent mother who dreams of seeing her children grow as good, responsible citizens. Above all, she prays for a family that stays happily together no matter what.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance

Knowing that a winner never quits, Ma Theresa A., moves on from her past with conviction that she will finish whatever she has started, and finish it well. At 46, Theresa is married to Emilio, an employee, and together they raise a child who is now in high school. Theresa did not finish college, but she makes sure that unfinished tasks will never happen again in her life, or the life of her child.\r\n\r\nTheresa presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store out of her residence. Being in the business for ten years now, Theresa has been doing well in her business and is earning around 9,000 PHP per month. Bible studies and trainings at CCT* also give her enough encouragement to keep growing and dreaming for greater things in her business and family.\r\n\r\nPart of any business is staying profitable, healthy and growing. So to help her grow her business, Theresa has requested a loan for 20,000 PHP. She will use this money to add more items to her store and attract more customers. She also wants to renovate her store and plans to use part of the loan money to start the renovation. She believes that more products on her shelves and a better-looking store would help increase her monthly income.\r\n\r\nAt present, Theresa admits finding it hard to be in competition with many other sari-sari stores in her area. Also, there are customers who are hard to follow up with in terms of their debts. Theresa also thinks of her child\u2019s high school expenses. However, despite these financial problems, Theresa is certain that she will end up finishing the race of life and emerging the winner. She dreams of seeing her business expand and eventually have branches in many locations. She also desires to help her mother out and of course, to see her child finish college with flying colors.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":657304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Jennifer also cooks viands (tasty dishes) so that neighbors who are in the rush and can not find time to cook their own meals can have a good meal from Jennifer's store and get going with their work. Jennifer earns a monthly income of 7,900 Philippines pesos (Php).\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Jennifer is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will use the money to buy more stocks of frozen food and enough ingredients for a daily variety of delicious viands for her customers to choose from. Jennifer desires to be able to put up a restaurant someday, and as stated, her consistency to provide excellent products is the key. She badly needs to maintain a consistently profitable business in order to meet the daily needs of her children.\r\n\r\nAs many small-scale entrepreneurs admit, Jennifer also finds it challenging to deal with customers with long lists of debts. But no challenge, no matter how difficult, can stop her from consistently working with all her strength in order to be able to send her children to school up until college. She envisions have her own house and living in it with a happy, successful family.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The youngest child is a 7th-grade pupil. \r\n\r\nAll the adult family members increase their common budget by working in different spheres: the eldest son raises money by building (his salary comes to 4,000 soms per month), while the daughter works for a private sewing workshop.

This business has been run for 10 years and during this time, the family has managed to improve their living standard.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her level of income, Anarkul wants to obtain cattle for fattening and raising. For this purpose, she hopes to get a loan. For the future, this woman has the following plans: to arrange her son\u2019s marriage and to prepare a dowry for her daughter.\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From? <\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Muzafar has been baking traditional bread since a young age. He inherited this skill from his father and grandfather. His working day starts at 4 a.m. when he and his assistants begin to knead dough, form the bread, and heat the stove. At the beginning, Muzafar kneads dough from two sacks of flour of 50 kg. each. The winter is an important period for his business, as there are many holidays this season. He needs to have a stock of flours and coal. For this reason Muzafar applied to IMON International for a loan of 8,200 Somoni. Muzafar and his family appreciate your support in helping him improve his business.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 56-year-old single lady and a mother of a 24-year-old girl.

They acquired their home through Infonavit in a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city. They want to protect themselves and their child from the lack of security in the neighborhood and are doing everything possible to enclose the outside of the house.\n\nRight now, they are finishing the construction of a fence in the rear of the house.

She started her business when she was very young.  She studied techniques for making rag dolls on a small table in her home and displayed the dolls for sale to students and housewives together with exercise books, pencils and pencil sharpeners, all at a good price.\r\n\r\nLittle by little Rosmira's business increased as did her customers and she added the display cases she now has one by one.  She also studied at a technical training center, learning a number of techniques which she liked.  She did a course on making underwear, using sewing machines and dressmaking in general and when she'd finished learning she went to work in a workshop where she perfected her art.  She still had her display cases in her house, however, helped by her family.  She managed to support her household very well in this way, especially as regards her children's studies.  She currently she feels very satisifed with her achievements but she fully intends to continue growing as a person and she wants to continue strengthening her business.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosmira's first loan and she will use it in her small business which is called \u201cVariedades Rosmy\u201d and specializes in selling ceramics, dolls and accessories, stationery and dressmaking supplies.  She will use her Kiva loan to buy materials to make rag dolls and Christmas-decorated ceramics.  She will also prepare for the back-to-school period in January and will invest in stationery products.  Her big dream is to some day manage to export her hand-made rag dolls.  She will feel happy when in some part of the world a little child's life becomes brightened as they receive a beautiful doll which is something she made herself with a lot of

They live in their own home in the indigenous community of \u00d1agazu (central Peruvian jungle).  Juan's main business activity is growing coffee, 'caigua' (a type of native cucumber) and bananas.  He has been farming for 3 years. His goal is to obtain a good-quality coffee.  He is already working on this.  His coffee crops are better every day.  He sells them in the Farmers Association in his district but during the farming season he also harvests the coffee of other farmers and sells it in the city of Villa Rica.\r\n\r\nJuan also makes industrial CDs and DVDs.  Every year in the month of December he travels to the country's capital to work on their production.  Now he would also like to break into the business of raising guinea pigs which are in high demand right now.\r\n\r\nThis is Juan's fourth loan from MFP and, as secretary of his community bank, he feels satisfied with the joint work that his group is constantly doing.  He will use his loan to buy 50 guinea pigs which cost 20 Peruvian soles each.

It means that she can invest more in strengthening her crops which she fertilizes constantly.  She sells every harvest to a well-known firm in the city of Villa Rica.

Esta muy satisfecho pues obtiene regulares ganancias que le han permitido sacar a su familia adelante; adem\u00e1s la labor es tranquila pues la realiza en su casa de lunes a viernes, durante la ma\u00f1ana y en la tarde. Trabaja solo, ya que el resto de su familia se dedica a otras labores; y entrega la mercader\u00eda una vez a la semana; pero como es un hombre trabajador tiene muchos planes para el futuro como el de aumentar la cantidad de mercader\u00eda que comercializa para mejorar sus ganancias. Es el primer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente ya que no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible este aporte que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. Aparicio tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de mercader\u00eda en pedrer\u00eda para cumplir con un pedido que tiene pendiente, de esta manera espera continuar progresando. \n\n","en":"Aparicio is 54 years old.  He lives in his own home together with his wife, 46 year-old Martha who is a saleswoman, and their five children.  Their children are all grown up and work.  Together they all work hard every day to get ahead in life. From a young age, this hard-working man learned to make jewelry (necklaces, earrings, bracelets) from different precious stones.  When he had to support his family, he didn't hesitate to continue with this work.  He currently produces all kinds of jewelry wholesale and he sells, to order, to the large stores in the city. \r\n\r\nAparicio is very satisfied because he makes regular profits which have allowed him to get his family ahead.  In addition, the work is relaxed since he does it from Monday to Friday, in the mornings and afternoons.  He works alone, since the rest of his family work in other jobs, and he delivers his goods once a week.  However, as he is a hard-working man, he has many plans for the future such as increasing the quantity of goods that he sells in order to improve his profits.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that Aparicio has had from MFP and he pledges to make his repayments on time as he doesn't want to disappoint the people who made this support possible since it will allow him to continue working in search of progress.  Aparicio is planning to invest the loan in buying merchandise, in buying precious stones so that he can fill an order that he has pending.  In this way he hopes to continue making progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":657678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy precious stones so that he can fill orders from his customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-04T15:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aparicio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":71.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.04},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.14},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.74},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.3},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.53,"local_amount":65.4,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":69.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463591,"comment":null},{"amount":26.71,"local_amount":71.25,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":75.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886975,"comment":null},{"amount":28.42,"local_amount":75.78,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":80.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327330,"comment":null},{"amount":29.83,"local_amount":79.54,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195895,"comment":null},{"amount":122.88,"local_amount":327.69,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":347.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349887,"comment":null},{"amount":34.48,"local_amount":91.96,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":97.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850481,"comment":null},{"amount":34.64,"local_amount":92.38,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":97.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620941,"comment":null},{"amount":73.51,"local_amount":196,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":207.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835173,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-25T18:26:49Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":254985,"name":"Jose Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Jos\u00e9 Carlos, tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Jocoaitique departamento de Moraz\u00e1n, vive con su esposa y sus dos hijos de 17 y 20 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a la talabarter\u00eda, este negocio trata de la elaboraci\u00f3n de productos de cuero en este caso el elabora vainas para machetes ya que estos machetes son muy utilizados en la gente del campo;

The name of this group, not to be confused with the name of an unpopular humbugger named Scrooge, was chosen by the members for its symbolic biblical meaning: \u00a8Hasta aqui nos ha ayudado Dios\u00a8 which translates as \u00a8God helped us get to this point\u00a8.  The loan consultant who has been working with this group describes the women as experienced, enthusiastic, hardworking individuals who seek to improve their family living conditions and offer support to one another. \r\n\r\nThe members of this group are involved in various micro-entrepreneurial activities including clothing sales, animal rearing and magazine sales. This loan will serve as working capital, used to make general investments in each woman\u00b4s individual business. Specifically, this loan will be put towards the purchase of livestock, animal feed, clothing merchandise (sandals, shoes, jewelry) and magazines. \r\n\r\nLucrecia C. V. is the elected president of this group. She is a 54-year-old mother of 5 (and grandmother) who lives with her husband, daughter, and grandson in Grano de Oro. Lucrecia has a retail business.  She plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of merchandise such as clothing, shoes, and perfumes. \r\n\r\nLucrecia says her day starts in the early morning when she rises to take care of household tasks such as taking care of her grandchild, cooking, and cleaning. The rest of her day is dedicated to her business, making sales, collecting repayments or purchasing merchandise. Her long term goal is to own her own store in a central location where she could offer her clients various items to peruse. This would permit her to spend less time in the street, making sales from door to door.  Her goals are to achieve economic stability for her family and improve their standards of living. \r\n\r\nA major difficulty that has affected her business has been the global economic crisis in the form of a reduction in sales. Lucrecia hopes to overcome this obstacle by expanding her business and securing clients in other communities. \r\n\r\nThe members of this group have grown to know each other on a deep and personal level. They have lived in the same community for the majority of their lives and are largely neighbors, family members, and friends. Lucrecia says the advantage of the group lending model is the ability of each member to act as a guarantor for another member. She can\u00b4t see any disadvantages associated with this loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":657683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes, shoes, perfumes for resale; to purchase livestock; to purchase magazines for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Grano de Oro, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-12-05T05:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elieth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cindy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1050000,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":167851.02},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":170648.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":173492.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":176384.22},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":179323.96},{"due_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":182299.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.7},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":351.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":339.72,"local_amount":167860,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":169756.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148797,"comment":null},{"amount":345.38,"local_amount":170657.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":172585.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428419,"comment":null},{"amount":351.12,"local_amount":173493,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175453.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970559,"comment":null},{"amount":249.15,"local_amount":123110.1,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":124500.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201290003,"comment":null},{"amount":412.89,"local_amount":204013.8,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":206318.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158245,"comment":null},{"amount":426.74,"local_amount":210865.43,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":213247.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211231372,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-07T22:12:21Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:19:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":254988,"name":"Rosa Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa Estela, resiD. en Jucuapa departamento D.

She had her only son when she was 35, and she has to raise and educate him alone as the father of her child lost interest in them and started another home. \r\nShe used to work all day and her son was looked after by a babysitter. As her son got older, he would always ask for his father despite the fact that she tried to give him all the affection he needed. But that was enough, though the affection of a father can't be replaced, and certainly not with material things. \r\nWhen one of her sisters passed away, her grief was devastating and she hadn't the strength to do anything; they had been very close. This sister had left her some properties but, unfortunately, her other sisters took everything and only left her with two little rooms to live in. She did not claim anything else because it did not seem right to her to fight with her sisters. \r\nSubsequently, she stopped working and lived only on the pension that she received. But, she had her small son in her care and he was of school age and the money did not stretch far enough. At that time, one of her sisters had a small store where she rented out dresses and suits, but this sister got the opportunity to work abroad and closed the store. Then the idea occurred to Isabel that she could reopen this store and have a bazaar, as her sister had left behind some rentable garments, cloth, and other things. So, Isabel maD. and bought more dresses, and in this way she began her business and it has been going well to date. Her wish is that the business will grow and she can expand it. \r\n(In the photo, Isabel V. is in the upper left.) \r\nShe will use the loan for business capital. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":657719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-12-05T00:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Chabeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesica Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dosmila Erma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabi Isela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4200,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":705}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665403,"comment":null},{"amount":249.65,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408654,"comment":null},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826945,"comment":null},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269206,"comment":null},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136086,"comment":null},{"amount":251.79,"local_amount":705,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":711.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211208585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T16:12:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":255008,"name":"Los Tamarindos 1 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo se llama Los Tamarindos 1 porque en el lugar donde se re\u00fane el grupo hay varios \u00e1rboles de tamarindo, est\u00e1 ubicado en una comunidad de Morelos en M\u00e9xico.
