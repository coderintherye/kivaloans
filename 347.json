Therefore, together with her supportive family, she joined ASHI just recently so that she can request a loan which she will use to start up a small business raising pigs.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this business is that either you will slaughter the hog or you will sell it live after four months fattening. The larger the volume of hogs sold, the greater the profit. However, starting up with a small amount of capital, Consolacion would still be happy to see her small profit responding to her family\u2019s basic needs.\r\n\r\nWith ASHI and its partner Kiva,

Mario est\u00e1 casado y tiene 3 hijos menores entre los 8 y 11 a\u00f1os, su esposa lo acompa\u00f1a y tambi\u00e9n trabaja en su peque\u00f1a miscel\u00e1nea que atiende desde su casa y que le da la oportunidad de estar al cuidado personal de sus peque\u00f1os hijos, porque eso es lo que proporciona el tener un negocio en el mismo lugar donde se habita. Se inici\u00f3 en la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo a trav\u00e9s de una amiga, que conoce muy bien a esta organizaci\u00f3n y se ha convertido en promotora de sus beneficios; ella lo recomend\u00f3 ante el asesor Milgen S\u00e1nchez, porque ella sabe que \u00e9l y su esposa son muy responsables. Esta pareja siempre est\u00e1 en la b\u00fasqueda de su crecimiento personal, por eso cuando el Sena trae capacitaciones a su barrio, participan teniendo en cuenta que sea funcional para administrar mejor su negocio. Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n por valor de $ 1.600.000 con el planea comprar una vitrina y surtir el negocio; a Mario le ha gustado estar en la Fundaci\u00f3n por la sensibilidad social de sus asesores con ellos pueden ser sinceros para que la ayuda sea m\u00e1s efectiva. Sus sue\u00f1o es especializarse en electr\u00f3nica cuando el negocio tome un mayor auge, aumente su mercado y por consiguiente las ventas. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es obtener una vivienda porque en la actualidad vive en arriendo y tiene la esperanza de acogerse a los programas del estado para adquirirla y no tener que pagar m\u00e1s arriendo.

He managed to improve his skills when he received a technical degree from SENA when he was 22. For a long time, and since he was very young, he worked as an electrician's assistant in informal shops. There he gained valuable experience for when he risked jobs on his own and this was how he learned. \r\n\r\nFor reasons of destiny, he left his hometown located in the department of Magdalena with his wife of four years, to live in Soledad, looking for a calm and productive life. Initially Mario received his first credit of $1,000,000 COP from the National Government. With this money he bought spare parts, which he gradually accumulated, he bought a display case, and little by little he filled it with merchandise. Now he has display cases, shelves, a work bench and a great variety of tools for the various jobs that he does. In addition to the services he offers as an electrician, he also does maintenance work, repairs and remodeling, which he to say he does everything.  \r\n\r\nMario and his wife have 3 young children between the ages of 8-11 years old. His wife accompanies him and also does her own miscellaneous jobs that she can attend to from their home and which allows her the opportunity to care for their small children, this is the benefit of having a business in the home. They began with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because of a friend that knew the organization well and had become a promoter of its benefits. This friend recommended them to the loan officer, Milgen S\u00e1nchez, because she knew that Mario and his wife were very responsible and that the couple is always seeking ways to improve themselves. When SENA brought trainings to their neighborhood, Mario and his wife participated knowing that it would help them to better manage their business. \r\n\r\nThis will be the second credit with the Fundaci\u00f3n for the amount of $ 1.600.000 COP. Mario plans to buy a display case and to support the business. Mario has liked working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the social sensitivity of the loan officers because Mario can be sincere with them so that they can help him most effectively. His dream is to specialize in electronics once the business takes off, increasing his inventory and as a result his sales. His greatest challenge is to obtain a home because his family is leasing. He hopes to qualify for the state programs to obtain homes so that he will no longer have to lease. Mario lives in a good neighborhood because his neighbors like his family and they all help each other, what's more there are many organizations that are based there to support families and especially his childrens' school where they receive a scholarship and Mario is very grateful for the school and he helps with the things that he knows how to do like paint, repair the walls and do electrical repairs. He has earned a good reputation with the director of the school and the faculty that educates his children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly McKinnon, Kiva

Jorge Luis is married and has three children, ages 11, 8 and 7 months. He is the owner of a micro-business that sells soft drinks, milk, cheese and minutes for cellular phones. His business began because the area that he lives in does not have a store that offers soft drinks and food stores are far away. Jorge and his wife run the store from a room in their house, which they have built themselves. Jorge and his wife are hardworking and are well known throughout their community. They both have a healthy credit history due to prior credits they have received from various lending entities that they have repaid punctually, as when they financed the purchase of their motor bike. The motor bike serves as a mode of transportation and generates income,  considering it is the most common form of transportation in the region to commute from one place to another. Jorge has received financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that he used to buy part of his assets like the refrigerator for his soft drink sale business and to begin his communications business.\r\n\r\nJorge has applied for a credit of $1,600,000 COP that he wants to invest in the purchase of food and packaging. He believes that his small business has allowed him to increase his family's income in order to improve their well being and complete the construction of their house. Jorge is very grateful for the help that is authorized via Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because he began with nothing, but with the support that he received he continues growing little by little. What's more, Jorge wants to increase his business, considering that there aren't stores nearby, he wants to convert to a self-service grocery store that can offer a variety for his customers and potentials to find easily what they need and desire. His principle project is to increase his income from his business and work, because he wants to save to send his children to college, helping them to broaden their outlook and well being in the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly McKinnon, Kiva

He works with his 29 year old son and together they sell tools, parts and accessories for heavy cargo vehicles in a stall in the neighborhood of El Bosque near the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo office in Cartagena. Argemiro  seeks a credit of $2.000.000 COP and wants to invest in a large purchase of chains, belts, shackles and tracks for tractor-trailers because they are the articles that are most asked for and most expensive.\r\n\r\nHe began his business selling door to door in the streets of the neighborhood of El Bosque accompanied by his only son. At the beginning he sold products like padlocks, watches and glasses, but as a capitalizing man, he began to sell the merchandise that he currently sells. He has had four previous credits with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that have helped him to capitalize his business and this is how he was able to establish himself on a single corner in the same neighborhood that is close to various transportation and heavy cargo businesses. For his good treatment, kindness and responsibility he has won over the clientele in his area, the majority of whom are owners of tractor-trailers and this his how he positioned his business as it is today. The credits from Fundaci\u00f3n have given him greater earnings and more family income with which he has been able to improve his household and to generate income to maintain the work of he and his son and daughter and grandchildren. \r\n\r\nAs his stall is in a public space, he always keeps it clean and orderly and has the support of the businesses in the area, he is afraid that they would make him leave this site. Because of this, his goal is to find a place where he can afford the lease and that is located in a place that is spacious and close so that he can maintain more variety in products and to acquire other lines that have connection with the market that he works with. Another dream is to continue improving the house in which he and his family live.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly McKinnon, Kiva

She is asking for her ninth loan and will use it to buy a computer so that her children can do their university work and research on it. As well, Rosalpina would use it to do work that she hasn\u2019t been able to finish in the office because a reduction in hours has meant that she can\u2019t complete reports in the time allotted. \r\n\r\nHer past loans have been used to improve her house.

Since her small house is made of blocks but the room (to be replaced) and the kitchen are of zinc and are already old, what she wants is to begin building and to be able to have more comfort as well as better hygiene. For this project, she will buy blocks, sand, iron, and cement to begin. Her goal is to complete all of her house in concrete, since (with the present zinc construction of the room and the kitchen) she is on the watch for crime every day. She is motivated by the loans, thanks to which she is is able to make a better house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":482615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy blocks, sand, iron and cement to begin construction of a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-03T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.78,"local_amount":1135.6,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1188.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874626,"comment":null},{"amount":27.59,"local_amount":551.8,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":577.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639955,"comment":null},{"amount":27.87,"local_amount":557.37,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":583.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821742,"comment":null},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":533.4,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":558.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561752,"comment":null},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":558.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":584.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770674,"comment":null},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":561.95,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":588.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204564,"comment":null},{"amount":55.07,"local_amount":1101.03,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1152.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330272,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-03T22:45:37Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":173637,"name":"Jehova Es Mi Protector 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Micheline is the coordinator of her group Jehova es Mi Protector (God is my protector), and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

She lives in the district of Oropesa, 30 minutes from the capital  city of Cuzco.  She is 31 years old, lives with her partner, and has two children who are 4 and 1 year old.  She is a housewife and alternates the activities of the home with working in a business.  She sells guinea pigs in bulk and in smaller quantities.  She raises the guinea pigs, fattens them, and later sells them.  She has around 700 guinea pigs and they have reproduced and now she needs more food than ever for the babies.  She has a plot of land where she planted alfalfa (a vegetable that can serve as food for rodents and other animals).  She has always provided for her animals from this land but last week it rained very unexpectedly, and in 24 hours they got the equivalent of 1 month of rainfall.  Eleven regions of the city flooded, leaving behind a lot of damage.  This region was not as demolished, but it still suffered economic loss.  Our member needs the loan to be able to buy alfalfa to feed to her guinea pigs.  The flood that harmed the city of Cuzco carried away the alfalfa she had planted on her land and now she needs to buy food for her guinea pigs to keep selling them.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful and values the opportunity given to her, and she promises to finish paying off the debt at the established rate.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva

Like all young persons wanting to do well in life, her parents have supported her efforts to complete her professional studies in Business Administration.  \r\n\r\nHowever, financial obstacles forced her to look for work.  It was difficult at first.  However, she found work in a bank as a trainer.  She received no salary for this work, only per-diems.  She moved her class schedule to Sundays during her final year.  Although this was very difficult, she was preparing for finals and she studied.  \r\n\r\nEconomic need pushed her into looking for work elsewhere.  She found a position doing various activities like: customer service, filing, data processing.  She's paid better, although she's just in training, but she hopes to become permanent.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting funding to pay the fees for her thesis defense and her graduation costs so that she can have better employment opportunities in the future.

A. is from the village of Aguada, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental.

Ruth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional grocery items for her business. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more groceries to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

To make a living, Eufemia owns and operates a manufacturing business, making and selling bamboo products like \"amakan\" (floor mats) to local businesses and community members. Eufemia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $150 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eufemia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Eufemia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Eufemia is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to expand her product offerings. This will be her 4th loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Agapita L. is from Mahayag, Zamboanga del Sur.

Her store serves as their second source of income because her husband supports their basic daily needs.  \r\n\r\nAgapita joined PMPC to gain access to financial support and to engage in business activities. She has managed her business for more than five years and makes approximately $140 a month. She successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. Now she wants a new loan of 14,000 PHP for the purpose of additional capital to cover the expansion of her sari-sari store. It will be her 4th cycle loan from PMPC.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":483045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy a six-layer highly insulated yurt (ger) covering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-02-04T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vanchig","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4460},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4530},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4590},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4650},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4720},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4780},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4850},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4920},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4990},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5060},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5130},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5200},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5270},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5350},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5420},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5570},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5650},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5730},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5810},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5890},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5970},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5960}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.27},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.4},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.45},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.65},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.91},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.21,"local_amount":39850,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":48301.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124012000,"comment":null},{"amount":16.62,"local_amount":19940,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":24168.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129041062,"comment":null},{"amount":16.69,"local_amount":20023,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":24269.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136763601,"comment":null},{"amount":16.99,"local_amount":20391,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":24715.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144795157,"comment":null},{"amount":16.49,"local_amount":19796,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":23994.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151975681,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-04T18:43:03Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:27:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":173777,"name":"Maha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maha is a 21-year-old single woman who lives with her mother and her brother.

So far, he is really happy with the ger insulation and feels that he is saving money from spending less on fuel and is keeping warmer than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank Eco Products Program:\r\nUlaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":483051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy a six-layer highly insulated yurt (ger) covering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bayanderlger","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4459.92},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4522.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4649.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4714.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4780.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4847.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4914.85},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4983.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5053.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5123.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5195.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5267.95},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5341.55},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5416.19},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5491.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5568.6},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5646.41},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5725.31},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5805.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5886.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5968.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6052.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.27},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.45},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.98},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":173783,"name":"Karimova Labarhan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Labarhan, 57, is the leader of this group. She was born in Aravan village and has been living there since then. She is married and has three children, all of whom are married and live separately except her youngest son. Like Labarhan, her husband is also a farmer.\r\n\r\nHere, in our country, usually the youngest child stays with the parents and looks after them, especially when they become older. Her son is 29 years old and works as a taxi driver in the village. He has three children, and two sons are twins! Quite a rare case for almost everybody! Labarhan\u2019s daughter-in-law is a housewife and also looks after the family business.\r\n\r\nLabarhan and her family have land where potatoes and cotton are cultivated. For this loan Labarhan is planning to buy seed potatoes, mineral fertilizer and get prepared for sowing. She has been in this business for sixteen years. In the future her family is planning to buy additional land and also to start livestock breeding. Maybe later loans will be disbursed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBahtiyor, 38, is the father of four children: three daughters and one son. The middle daughter is a disabled person but all the others go to school. Bahtiyor is a farmer and he will use the loan to buy cotton seed and fertilizer. Bahtiyor also keeps two bulls for breeding and wants to increase the number of his livestock.\r\n\r\nSabahathan, 55, is also a farmer. Her family has a total of 0.5 hectares (1.25 acres) of land and she cultivates potatoes and wheat there. She needs a loan to prepare for spring sowing, which requires her to plow and buy seed potatoes. She is married with one son who in turn is married and has one son. All the family members, including Sabahathan\u2019s husband, take an active role in the family business. This year Sabahathan is planning to make repairs to her house.\r\n\r\nGulanarahon is 25 years old and the youngest member of this solidarity group, but not the least. She is married with one son. She will use this loan to buy textiles to start a new business. Before getting married she helped her mother and they had a little sewing workshop. So she is planning to open her own workshop to produce garments, coverings, etc. This is her number one priority as well as to bring up a good son!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She says that the main challenges to her business are poor marketing of milk products and drought.<P>\r\n\r\nShe has requested this first loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 45,000 to purchase and insure a dairy cow. She says the added dairy cow will help her to be able to pay her children's school fees. In the future, she'd like to expand her dairy farming to produce 20 litres of milk a day.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo<P>\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is an innovative, for-profit social enterprise working with smallholder farmers in Kenya.

Let's get to know the members of the group.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't easy to start a business for Eileen; each time she recollects how it all started, she tears up.  She had about 50 soles ($15 USD) in her pocket which she used to buy a little bit of merchandise to sell (thread, needles, nail polish, and a few plastic carts).  She used some fruit boxes that her friend gave her as a display case.  Her optimism and strength to progress and to proviD. for her young daughter helped her to sell all her merchandise by the end of the month, pay the rent for her stand, and earn a small amount of money to grow her small store.  The loans she received were invested in the purchase of baby clothing, toys, shoes, home decorations, and cosmetics.  She is grateful to God for the blessings she's received; she never complains with the small business that she runs as it helps to proviD. for, educate, and clothe her 11 year old daughter.  She was also able to rent another small store where she sells plastic goods (buckets, teapots, plastic bags, brushes, dustpans, disposable plates, etc.) and to buy a small piece of land in a new area of town.  This loan will be used to improve her business and supply it with more toys to sell.\r\n\r\nHilza, on the other hand, runs a business selling beer and soft drinks from her home.  With this business, she is able to help her husband proviD. for the family, especially their children's school and clothing expenses.  She provides the basics for them because she doesn't earn a lot.

She lives in her sales kiosk, which is located in the Plaza Arandia Villa F\u00e1tima.  She wishes to expand her kiosk so that she may increase her income, now that she has children of school age.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Silvia is the treasurer, and she sells sweets in the Hernando Siles school, where she is also the door-woman.  She has children who are attend the same school where she works.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Natividad is the secretary, responsible for taking minutes of the board's proceedings.  She works selling various items at different fairs throughout La P. depending on the season and how much capital she has at the time.  For example, she has a regular post at the fair of Alasita that she can rely on working; in this manner, going from fair to fair, she supports herself throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\nThese three people are the head of the Banco D. Empredimiento, which is maD. up of ten people who, because they all know each other, form a guarantee amongst themselves that they will not miss their payments, making the bank a reliable institution.\r\n\r\nA majority of the members rely on their own fixed place of business to earn money.  The other 10% takes merchandise to peoples' homes, delivering goods to a regular group of customers, since they do not own their own homes from which they could work.  All the members are very hard-working, and their businesses are their only source of income, which they rely upon to maintain their homes and families.  They are responsible with their loans.  Currently, they are working with their fourth loan from Kiva and have not had a single problem.  They all know each other very well and work together to assist each other.\r\n\r\nThe loan they now request is to be used for purchasing merchandise and, in a few cases, to increase capital to put towards improving work places.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are very thankful to both Emprender and Kiva for the confidence those groups have displayed to them in offering loans to the members to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva

His dream is to have his own establishment and to have more income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly McKinnon, Kiva

Silveria C. G. is the representative of the group.\r\n\r\nSilveria lives in the Emiliano Zapata community in the Chiapas region of Mexico, where she has lived for 3 years with Mr. Luis in a common law marriage.  Three children depend on her, Mari, Ramiro, and her youngest, Janet, who is 2 years old.  They attend primary school.  Silveria is not educated, and therefore works tirelessly every day to give her children the opportunities she did not have.\r\n\r\nSilveria dedicates herself to baking.  She requests this loan to buy supplies such as flour, yeast, cheese, and other ingredients.  She has been a baker for 3 years, having learned from her mother-in-law.  She says this loan will help her greatly, since one of the factors which has affected her business is the high cost of ingredients.  \r\n\r\nOn top of this, since she doesn\u2019t have her own oven, she has to plan ahead to borrow one in order to make her breads.  In addition, she doesn\u2019t have her own store, and therefore travels to nearby communities to sell her products.  Her dream is to one day have her own oven, so she can work more days of the week.

Calder\u00f3n has a property that measures 6 blocks long with different types of areas to develop.  She has 2 blocks that she uses to raise basic grains (beans and corn), 1 block which she uses to grow vegetables.  She has a tomato crop with an irrigation system, for which she will use the loan.  It is to buy agricultural supplies such as: 400 kilograms of urea fertilizer, 700 kilograms of fertilizer, and to pay the farm workers' wages for this crop.  This client began by farming basic grains and only did so in the winter season.  She worked with the help of her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is married and has a husband and 2 young children who cannot help them with the farm work.  On a typical work day, her husband gets up early at 4:30 in the morning to light the fire with the dry wood that he collects in the fields, as they have no other alternative in order to prepare their food.  Later she prepares coffee and food that they take with them to the fields, as well as food that is for her children who stay home and are looked after by her niece, because they are young.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe has dedicated her whole life to this type of work and is still doing it.  Now, in addition to growing basic grains, she also grows vegetables, which she hopes will allow her to continue improving and expanding her labors to be able to produce more foods and better foods on her lands.  This would help improve her income, allowing her to improve her quality of life.  In the future, she hopes to be able to dedicate more time to her children and take care of them herself.  Right now she and her husband have to work together in order to complete the harvest and in this way generate their income, as they depend solely upon their work in the fields.  \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Andrea has had 3 loans with Ceprodel and has been working with them for 3 years.

On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called \"gers,\" with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the ger districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the ger districts. The bottom fifth quintile spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy

AMOR (LITTLE DROPS OF LOVE)\r\n\r\nThis communal bank is in its 15th loan cycle.  To date, its twelve members have shown responsibility and entrepreneurship in their various businesses.  They make the effort to succeed and proviD. the best for their family members, which is their main objective in life.  Among them are:\r\n\r\nElizabeth, 32, is a single mother.  Prior to having her business selling sweets, she was in the same line of work but she did it as a peddler; she pushed her cart along the streets in her neighborhood.  In the mornings, she sells prepared meals next to her small wooden sales stall (kiosko) that she set up thanks to her profits earned and loans obtained.  In general, her dishes are bought by public transport drivers and bill collectors.  Her business has improved over time and its earnings help her to raise and proviD. for her two children, who are 17 and 6 years old.  She needs stock items for her sales:  potato chips, meat skewers, soft-drinks, which are her best sellers.\r\n\r\nClaudia, 58, has sold prepared meals for over 18 years.  She began by having the food concession at a railway company; she did well there.  Afterwards, she left employment there and leased a stand.  At the beginning, she had steady income but later, due to the excessive administrative costs that she had to pay, her meals stopped being profitable.\r\n\r\nThis led her to set up the same kind of business in her own home.

This school was established in 1950 to train children of the Masomgbo community, and villages close to it, as future leaders.

Currently, the school has 488 pupils and a staff of 13 teachers. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan these teachers are accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.<P>\r\n\r\nFifty-seven-year-old Alie A. S.
