Mrs. Chek P. was selected the President of the group by its members.  She is a good cook, hired by the villagers during wedding ceremonies and parties.  Her husband, Mr. Yim Phorn, is a farmer who owns a 1-hectar field on which he cultivates rice. This field has infertile soil which is a challenge, because it affects his crop production. Fertilizer would help make the field more productive.  Mrs. Chek P. decided to ask for a loan to buy the fertilizer.  She is 37 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom is a waiter, two are enrolled in the local school and the youngest is too young to work or study. <p>\r\n\r\nSeven members in this group have end-of-term loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. The other group members have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":386760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

She is 40 years old, married and has two children aged 16 and 8, both attending school. She finished 6th grade but had to drop school when her father passed away, and she had no one to help her out with school expenses. She owns a house where she lives with her family.\r\n\r\nEnia left Inhambane in 1974 and moved to Beira, where she lived for 14 years, and then moved to Boane with her mother and brothers in 1988. She learned how to be a salesperson years ago from her aunt, and has been doing it for the past 12 years, selling several products at a convenience store. She has no employees.  She makes approximately 4.500,00MT (U$ 170) per month. She mostly sells soap, matches, sugar, cookies, etc. Her husband has a similar job at a different store. \r\n\r\nThis is Ernia's second loan, and she asks for 14.000,00MT (U$ 525) to buy more inventory. Her first loan was 11.000,00MT that she used for the same purpose. She has never taken loans in other banks. She hopes to be able to pay it in a reasonable time so she can make more loans in the future. She dreams to one day be able to open her own pastry shop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":514.18,"image":{"id":386787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"basic merchandise to sell at her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-13T07:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.82,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":615.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":643},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":672.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":702.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":734.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":767.4},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":802.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":838.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":876.24},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":915.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":957.26},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000.53},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1045.76},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1093.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1142.44},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1194.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.35},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.07,"local_amount":615.19,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":626.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056883,"comment":null},{"amount":28.2,"local_amount":751.93,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":765.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971837,"comment":null},{"amount":50.02,"local_amount":1333.75,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1357.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816776,"comment":null},{"amount":53.93,"local_amount":1438.14,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1464.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708958,"comment":null},{"amount":188.77,"local_amount":5033.99,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-20T08:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5125.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938001,"comment":null},{"amount":79.39,"local_amount":2287.42,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2328.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.39,"payment_id":128971969,"comment":null},{"amount":68.06,"local_amount":1892.85,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1927.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.92,"payment_id":136698565,"comment":null},{"amount":22.74,"local_amount":646.73,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":658.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.51,"payment_id":151915989,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-13T19:44:32Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136278,"name":"Odet","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Odete Antonio M. nasceu no distrito de boane, tem 27 anos de idade, solteira e m\u00e3e de 2 filhos com 3 e 9 anos de idade, a mais velha estuda na escola publica de boane.

She hopes to pay off the loan without issue so she can apply for more credit with the objective of constructing an brick establishment to improve the sales of her products and gain more customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":386790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy and Sell used clothing (all ages)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T15:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Odet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":571.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":597.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":624.06},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":652.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":681.76},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":712.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":744.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":778.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":813.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":850.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":929.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":971.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1014.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1060.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1108.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.97},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.97},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.22},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.4},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":21.97,"local_amount":571.25,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":596.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056884,"comment":null},{"amount":70.81,"local_amount":1841.08,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1922.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971838,"comment":null},{"amount":95.14,"local_amount":2473.52,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2582.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816777,"comment":null},{"amount":102.22,"local_amount":2657.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2775.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708959,"comment":null},{"amount":209.86,"local_amount":5456.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5697.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938002,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T23:28:58Z","paid_date":"2010-03-16T08:23:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136279,"name":"Amina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amina is a  member of the Maendeleo borrower group in Nzonwe, Mbeya. she is 30  year  old woman, she is married and a mother of 3 children.

He is 39, married and the father of a 5 year old boy. He droped school in 5th grade. He lives with his wife. \r\n\r\nHe left Cabo Delgado to go to Maputo in 1996, searching for a better life. After that, he migrated to South Africa looking for work. While living there, he learned how to be a hairdresser, and then went back to Boane and started his own business. Now he owns a hair salon, and for the past 5 years he's been cutting hair and making around $5.000,00MT (U$ 175) per month, which he uses to support his family and pay back loans. This is his second loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 11.500,00MT (U$425) to buy construction supplies (cement, rocks, etc). The first loan was used to buy concrete and blocks in the amount of 6.000,00MT which he paid back without a problem. He hopes to make the money back in record time in order to apply for other loans. He wants to see his brick house finished so he can improve it later on. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":386797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"construction supplies (concrete, rocks, sand)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T20:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumail","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":11500,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":522.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":543.79},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":566.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":589.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":613.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":638.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":665.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":692.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":720.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750.52},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":781.36},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":813.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":846.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":881.7},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":917.94},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":955.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.1},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.79},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.61},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":19.3,"local_amount":522.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":524.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056886,"comment":null},{"amount":38.31,"local_amount":1036.57,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1040.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971840,"comment":null},{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":1023.38,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1026.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816779,"comment":null},{"amount":50.19,"local_amount":1357.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1362.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708961,"comment":null},{"amount":165.47,"local_amount":4477.51,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4492.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938005,"comment":null},{"amount":113.91,"local_amount":3082.26,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-31T11:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3092.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938006,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T03:20:13Z","paid_date":"2010-03-31T11:19:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136284,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribel S. is from the village of North Poblacion Guinsiliban in Camiguin.

He is 49 years old, divorced and the father of seven children with ages between 12 and 27. They all go to public school in Boane. The 7 children, plus 7 grandchidlren and 3 brothers all live at his house, under his responsibility. \r\n\r\nAtumane had to drop school in 8th grade when he was drafted to the army. He served in Nampula and Zambezia then left for Maputo with his wife and children searching for a better life. He later divorced his wife and she went back to her hometown, leaving him with the children.\r\n\r\nHe works at a mine clearance company as a sapper, but he's also a salesman at Boane's central market. With the help of his children, he sells rice, sugar, flour, and other items, which brings them approximately 5.000,00MT (U$175) per month. At the mine clearance company he makes about 1.650,00MT (U$60) for 5 days of work, depending on the amount of work available. He has never taken loans in other banks and this is his 3rd loan with Hluvuku-Adsema. He asks for 12.000,00MT (U$450) to buy more products (rice, sugar, flour, etc). His first two loans where for 8.500,00MT and 10.500,00MT, for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to pay the loan back within reasonable time so he can apply for other loans, in order to buy a truck to help the transportation of merchandise he buys in Maputo.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

Sopheap S. is a villager from the An Doung Samreth Village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a piece of land on which she grows rice and vegetables. She faces an obstacle because her field has infertile soil and it is far from an irrigation system. To solve this problem, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and rent a water pump.

Narzullo is 46 years old. He has lived for 20 years with the mother of his three children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muhabbat, 44 years old, is a mother of 4 children and a real expert in producing traditional national jewelry. She started as an assistant to a goldsmith, gained enough experience, and opened her own shop.  She has been in business for 5 years.  Muhabbat has successfully borrowed from IMON once, and has proven herself as an honest client. Today Muhabbat requests $700 US Dollars for purchasing materials like precious and semi-precious stones and reagents required for manufacturing the jewelry. <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Murat is dedicated to agricultural work, which is his only income to support his family, composed of his wife and five children. He has been dedicated to this business for several years and over time he has gained experience in cultivating crops.\r\n\r\nToday, Murat has come to IMON International with the proposition of obtaining a loan to purchase seed and fertilizer for planting. It is necessary to point out that, in order to carry out the first planting, you need to purchase the supplies and it is for this reason that he is confident that his loan request will be successfully granted and he will achieve his objective of having a good harvest to improve his economic situation.\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married and has four children. She has a business selling clothing in the small market of Shahrituz. Her business is going well as demand has been very stable over the last eleven years.\r\n\r\nSaidbuvi is an entrepreneur of high integrity and is very hardworking and energetic. Even when her competitors have similar products or lower prices, clients naturally gravitate to her as she can skillfully make them feel valued, respected and heard.\r\n\r\nSaidbuvi is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to purchase seasonal clothing which will help her to continue stabilizing her business and income so that she can support herself and her daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Deddeh is 50 years old. She is married and has 8 children, ages 12 - 35 years .She didn\u2019t go to school. She grew up in rural Lofa County, where most women are not educated because they believe they don\u2019t need to educate women. Instead, the women rely on their husbands to care for the entire family. \r\n\r\nShe lives in the Fiamah neighborhood in the north of Monrovia. It is a poor community that is not comfortable to live in because there is no electricity or piped-in water, and they live in small, tight houses. Families in this neighborhood are fed for about $1.50 a day.\r\n\r\nDeddeh sells charcoal. She buys wood in the rural area and burns it to make charcoal. Then she brings the charcoal to Monrovia and supplies the residents of Fiamah. Charcoal is the most popular cooking fuel in Liberia.\r\n\r\nShe started this business with a small amount of charcoal, but because Deddeh's charcoal is burnt very well and her human relations are so good, her business increased from one level to another. She has been in this business for 4 years and still wants to improve by owning a shop. She will use the loan she\u2018s applying for to burn more charcoal and acquire more profit, because her dream is for her and her family to become successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":386978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To

They farm seed potatoes, olluco (a root vegetable) and barley on leased and temporary (according to the rain) land. Among these, she prefers olluco and potato, which is why every year, she alternates the crops, while the barley is for family consumption. This work is done in partnership with her husband.

This will generate better earnings so that he can repay his loan and make home improvements for his family.  He thanks the Institution for approving this loan since many families could benefit from this type of assistance.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":387115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-12T22:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlon Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8212.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821225,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T00:36:30Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136451,"name":"Irma Benita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Irma Es originarai de la comunidad de PAnquix su actividad principal es la agricultura ella viene realizando dicha actividad economica  desde hace quince a\u00f1os actividad que aprendio de su difunto padre en la venta de verduras y maiz sus principales puntos de ventas en la plaza de Totonicapan los dias sabados y martes y los dias domingo en San Cristobal Totonicapan hoy necesita de un credito  para remodelar su vivienda  para tener un hogar digno para poder vivir","en":"Do\u00f1a Irma is from the community of Panquix.

On Mondays, the Manantiales group sells fruit at a fair, where group members also sell lunch, dinner and second-hand children's clothing. Everyone in the group lives near the fairground. The group has established a base of regular customers, but they know that marketplace competition is stiff. In order to succeed, they need more merchandise, a bigger, better work area, and the necessary credit to make these improvements. They hope to increase their income and improve their families' quality of life.

Hilda dreams of having a clothing stand in her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":387220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy merchandise, wool and clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-09-12T15:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":352.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87032790,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":352.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96945073,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-30T09:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":352.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103787001,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T09:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":352.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110677464,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-13T05:13:03Z","paid_date":"2010-01-16T09:47:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136498,"name":"Cenit","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Cenit tiene 48 a\u00f1os, es soltera, tiene 2 hijos mayores de edad, que trabajan y la apoyan.

She is a primary school teacher, and she works in a school that is located 2 hours from her house. She works as a teacher only in the mornings, so in the afternoons and in her free time, she takes advantage of her personal relationships to sell sweets (piononos, wholesome bread, and other types of pastries). She has been doing this for 2 years, and it has been going well. What she likes most about her work is that it keeps her busy, because since she was young, she has worked and she feels uncomfortable when she is doing nothing. Also, her business is very profitable; she orders her pastries fortnightly, delivers them to her clients and they pay her at the end of the month. She gives them the option so that they can collect the money and pay for many orders at once.

She lives with her only daughter, 17, who is studying for a technical career.   She set up a small store in her house where she sells basic foods (eggs, noodles, rice, milk, and bread, etc.) and drinks.  She has been doing this for a period of nine months.  She works in the store all day every day.  What she likes about the business is that through the business she gets to connect with a lot of people, and she wins many customers due to her good attention.  Also, she feels useful.  Being the only store in the region, it is very profitable.  She has also been selling beauty products for the past six months.  \r\n\r\nIn the future Adela would like to build a place for a mini market, which would help her neighbors with their daily purchases.  Her region is very far from the market.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  What she likes most about working with her communal bank is that all of the members support each other.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suyunbubu, the leader of this group, is 51 years old. She has raised four children, two sons and two daughters. All her children have already started adult life and earn their own livelihoods. Her eldest son works in Russia doing odd jobs at a construction site. Her eldest daughter works as a seamstress in Alamedin market in the capital. Her second son is an excavator, and her youngest daughter is a college student at the Humanities University in the capital. \r\n<p>\r\nSuyunbubu prefers to be independent from her children and earns her living by manufacturing curtains and tailoring. This business, which she has been working at for 20 years, makes her a humble income of $120 USD a month. Suyunbubu has also taught her daughters how to sew. With their help, Suyunbubu manages to get her work done faster. She has her own sewing machine and does all her work at home. However, she is in need of a new sewing machine as her current one has become old and inconvenient. She also needs to purchase some accessories for the sewing machine. Therefore Suyunbubu is requesting a loan to help her make these purchases and thus save valuable time. In the future, Suyunbubu hopes to marry her sons and daughters, and help her youngest daughter complete her college education. \r\n<p>\r\nSuyunbubu\u2019s partners are Shailoobai, Akmoor and Akmolmol. Shailoobai, 30, is married and has a cute five-month-old daughter. He provides for his family by raising livestock. He needs a loan to buy one sheep and three goats. \r\n<p>\r\nAkmoor, 33, is a mother of three children. She raises livestock and sells some of her cattle at market when needed. Akmoor needs a loan to buy five or six goats for breeding. \r\n<p>\r\nFor the last ten years, Akmolmol, 36, has been providing for her four children by raising cattle and selling milk. As the children grow, she needs to increase her income to meet their growing needs. She hopes to get a loan and buy a calf.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further), and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She is divorced and has raised two children on her own, both of whom are at school. Even though her family consists of just three members, Nargiza has to work hard to provide them with a worthy life. She makes a living by selling video and audio CDs, DVDs and mp3 players. Sometimes, she even manages to trade in cattle. She is very fortunate to have a caring brother, who is always by her side at difficult times. When Nargiza leaves her stall to transport goods, he replaces her so that trade is not interrupted.   \r\n<p>\r\nTwo years in business have brought her evident results: purchase of a car for transporting goods, and some convenience goods for her home. Her original investment was $70 USD, and her current monthly income is around $480 USD. Nargiza's plan is to build a house and set her children on their feet by providing them with a good education. For this, Nargiza needs a loan to purchase video and audio CDs, DVDs, children\u2019s school uniform, table napkins and diapers, as she has noticed a growing demand for these goods. \r\n<p>\r\nNargiza\u2019s partners are Nariste, Baktygul, Larisa and Nurlan. Nariste, 26, is married. Her husband is a security guard at a casino, whereas she buys milk products wholesale and sells them at the market. She needs a loan to buy butter, cottage cheese and sour cream. \r\n<p>\r\nBaktygul, 34, has two children. She sells foodstuffs in a small shop. In addition, she sells chewing gum, cigarettes and vitamins, at the city market. Baktygul needs a loan to purchase school equipment, cereals, soft drinks and ice-creams. \r\n<p>\r\nLarisa, 34, is married and has three children.

The leader of the group, Raikul is forty six years old. An unsuccessful marriage and subsequent divorce did not shake her belief in life and happiness. She has raised her children on her own and her two sons have grown up and become mature. They received all her love and have absorbed all her efforts to inspire in them family values. Now the eldest son always helps his mother. He works in a brick factory. The little son, 18, has gone to serve in the army.\r\n\r\nAs to Raikul, she is engaged in animal husbandry and cattle breeding. Some years ago she bought a calf from her sister and that is how she got involved in this business. She quickly grasped the aspects of this occupation and her earnings have allowed her to pay for her eye treatment and buy better food for home. She has lots of plans about making repairs to her house and building a convenient shed, but before that, she wants to get a loan to buy a milk cow. Selling milk would bring in more money for the family budget. \r\n\r\nRaikul has three partners: Kyialbek, Nurgulya and Jumakan:\r\n\r\nKyialbek, 33, raises livestock. Kolkhoz gave him a cow instead of a salary and Kyialbek managed to increase the total population and improve his living standards. He hopes to obtain a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nNurgulya, 24, is a housewife with two children. Besides that, she keeps some cattle and sells milk. The earnings from what she does have tremendously helped her husband buy a house. Nurgulya feels inspired to buy one more cow to increase her income. However, she needs a loan to do that.\r\n\r\nJumakan, 49, is the mother of four children. Together with her husband they raise cattle and thus provide for themselves, as their children are grown-ups and live separately. Jumakan wants to buy a cow. This loan would enable her to make this purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

is Marlyn F., a 42-year-old fish vendor from Tala, Caloocan City. Four of her six children are still in school. Her husband, Salvador, 46, is a driver. Marlyn has been selling fresh fish in the flea market downtown. She earns more than 10,000 PHP a month, mostly on weekends. Most of her clients are restaurant owners and busy workers.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarlyn joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative only eight months ago, yet she is on her third loan cycle with the cooperative. She has applied for a new loan of 8,000 PHP as additional capital to keep her fish selling business going.

She has quite an unusual way of selling. She brings clothes from Turkey and, instead of selling them in a clothing store, she prefers to go around various companies offering to sell clothes. Not so long ago, Elmira used to sell bedding and underwear, but after looking at her friend's business, she decided to switch to clothes. This did increase her monthly income. Now it is around $165. Elmira needs a loan to purchase clothes for the fall season. She is planning to start saving money to buy a house. One of her dreams is to have her own clothing store. \r\n<p>\r\nElmira is 44. Her family consists of four people. Having mothered two sons, she has raised them alone, being a widow. Her eldest son is 23. He is married and works in a micro credit company. His wife stays at home and takes care of the kitchen. This saves Elmira valuable time to do her job at the market. Her second son is temporarily unemployed. However, he often helps his mother carry and display the goods. \r\n<p>\r\nElmira is the leader of this group and has the very radiant smile. Elmira's partners are Ainura, Venera and Elchibek. Ainura, 39, is divorced. She has one son, a school student. She works in a state agency with the government. She wants to obtain a loan to buy a washing machine \u2013 a purchase that she has been planning for a long time. In the future, Ainura plans to open her own news agency. \r\n<p>\r\nVenera, 36, is a widow. She has two sons; both are school students. She works in a financial institution. In addition, she sells clothes. She does not sell them herself; instead, she hires a salesman. Venera needs a loan to purchase clothes to expand her assortment of goods.\r\n<p>\r\nElchibek, 36, is married. He has one son and two daughters. Together with his wife, they sell clothes at the market. They used to have a cow, and after selling it, they invested all the money in clothes. Now they make $360 a month. Elchibek needs a loan to buy more clothes. \r\n<p>\r\n======================================<br>\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3 P's concept: <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

They live in their own home in the zone Maica Norte, 10 minutes from the city of Cochabamba.  This area is known for its dairy and agriculture business.  \r\n\r\nRuth has been working in the dairy business for 13 years.  She began when she was very young, working with her mother who taught her everything about caring for dairy cows.    Today she has her own dairy cow, and she sells all the milk to a local company that makes all kinds of dairy products. \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to purchase feed to store during the dry season. This ensures that her dairy cow does not have to go without food during the drought, and her production won't be affected.   This protects her income and let's her grow her business, so that she can continue to improve her living conditions.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":387168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase feed for her dairy cow.

She lives with her partner, is 38 years old, and has three daughters who are still students. The need to support her daughters and to see them succeed has pushed Luz to decide and find a source of income. She started her business with 300 Soles following the advice of a friend who told Luz about an organization that supports women (\"Movimiento Manuela Ramos\", or MMR). Luz started buying and selling in small scale until she got to know more people and have more customers. Finally, she decided to take her business to the next level. Now she raises domestic animals in her house, where she has a small farm. \r\nWith her partner's help, she is making the business flourish. With this loan of 1,700 Soles, Luz will buy more animals like hens, ducks, and pigs to resell them; she will also buy feeding supplies like powder feed, corn, and vitamins. The animals are in demand in restaurants, especially in those that sell regional foods.

has had a mototaxi (a motorised vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers) with which he covered his personal costs. With the help of a Kiva field partner institution and with the fruit of his work he was able to purchase a cheap plot of land in an area outside of the city where he has begun to build a house using basic materials.\r\n\r\nThe continual use of his vehicle has lead to serious mechanical demage in the motor, which is why he is now applying to Kiva for a loan of 1200 nuevos soles which he plans to

She is married, 54 years old and the mother of 7 children, 3 of whom are still dependent on her. Etelvina has spent 2 years making clothes, and bit by bit she has been generating her own income and saving her money, which she wants to use to set up her own dressmaking workshop; as she is skillful at sewing no doubt this will happen. She tells us that her sales are doing very well and that she works to advance orders from her clients. She is currently making clothes for an already faithful clientele who she welcomes in her house on a daily basis to take orders and work on pieces and personally attends to them with her characteristic friendliness. With this loan of S\/ 1,500.00 she will buy metres of different types of cloth, tools such as scissors, needles for sewing by hand and by machine, pins and buttons. Nowadays, Etelvina feels like a very accomplished woman, with a greater desire to reach for her dreams and make them reality. She gives thanks to the Kiva Field Partner Manuela Ramos for helping her to start her business and for the help they give to many woman who want to grow as entrepreneurs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":387553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase sewing materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T03:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Etelvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":255.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87075044,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":255.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990433,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":255.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835448,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":255.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727182,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":255.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117587,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":255.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953441,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T20:52:20Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136628,"name":"Cristal Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cCristal\u201d es el nombre de la asociaci\u00f3n formada por doce socias, pertenece al Centro Focal Exaltaci\u00f3n de la ciudad de El Alto, con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n ya tienen una antig\u00fcedad de cinco a\u00f1os junto a la organizaci\u00f3n, Actualmente, diversos son los negocios que tienen este grupo, desde la venta de abarrotes,  comercializando ropa y tambi\u00e9n se dedican a la venta de lubricantes y refacci\u00f3n de llantas para autom\u00f3viles.\nToda la asociaci\u00f3n precisa incrementar su capital para poder comprar mayor  mercader\u00eda, solo de \u00e9sta forma podr\u00e1n obtener la rentabilidad de sus negocios y mejorar la calidad de vida de sus familias.\n","en":"\u201cCristal\u201d (Crystal) is the name of the association formed by 12 members, who belong to the Centro Focal Exaltaci\u00f3n in the city of El Alto.

She continues with her business and tells us that she is doing well because cold drinks have good sales and customers like the taste.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1700 soles, she will buy packages of soft drinks in different flavor, sizes, and brands.  She will also buy mineral water, carbonated and non-carbonated.\r\n<p>\r\nModesta is very proud that she was able to start a business and can assure herself of a peaceful retirement.

On this plantation, he faces an obstacle because his field is infertile, which has a bad effect on his crop.  In order to deal with this problem, Mrs. Sim Touch decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field and make the crop more productive.  She is 52-years-old and the mother of eight children. Three of her children are employed in a garment factory, another is a construction worker, three are attending the local school, and the youngest one is too young to work or study. \r\n\r\nSix members in this group loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.

She dreams of growing her livelihood more to help support the education of her children.\r\n\r\nJuanita would like to apply for a loan of Php 5,000 from Community Economic Ventures Inc. (CEVI). She will use the loan to buy additional ingredients for food that she cooks and sells. The income she makes from selling food helps a lot in covering the daily expenses in their home.\r\n\r\nJuanita joined CEVI\u2019s micro-credit program in 2007. She said she likes its services because it has only a 2% interest rate which is lower and more affordable to repay.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":387843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She faces a problem because she does not have rice seed to plant in her paddyfield. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy rice seed. Her husband, Mr. Kong Vanna, is a motorbike taxi driver. Mrs. Sopheap R. is 44 years old and the mother of three children, all of whom attend the local school. \r\n<p>\r\nEight members in this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those who have EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These loans allows the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Morng L. will use her loan to buy a motorcycle for her unemployed son to begin a taxi service and the rest of the loan she will use to purchase silk threads for braiding.
