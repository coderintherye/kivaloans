is 30 and married with 2 children ((ages 8 months and 1 yr).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumber.    Faataumamate needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Faataumamate joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Faataumamate's 1st loan with SPBD. \n\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nFaataumamate's Overall Social Metric Score*:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

is 56 and married with 6 children (ages 22-37).  She owns & operates a business venture, selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  She has 4 years of experience in this business.    Pine needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in renovating the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Pine joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Pine's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma G. runs a general store selling a variety of different products in her community. She is 40 years old, married and has two school-age children. She is from the village of Facoma. Wilma has been in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Wilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Wilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase products to sell. Wilma is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This will be her ninth loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to pay for the tuition fees of her children. \r\n<p>\r\nWilma is the leader of a ten member group accessing a loan from ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"ASA Facoma\".\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/i>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":444902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is 44 years old, married and has two school-age children. They are from the village of Matusalem. Baltazar has been in his business for over eight years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Baltazar joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living conditions and enable him to engage in business activities. Baltazar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to to purchase products to sell. Baltazar is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand his product offering. This will be his ninth loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n<p>\r\nBaltazar is the leader of a 5 member group accessing a loan from ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Marcos\".\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 21 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. lives with his mother in Tuv province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. His mother is already retired but helps in his business. Zorigt has been trying different businesses to be successful. He started a business making food with seaweed in 2006; however, it did not go well and he decided to switch to production of baked goods. Today Zorigt makes eight types of baked goods and sells them at various supermarkets in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He says that he has finally got the kind of business he was looking for, and aims to expand his business. He plans to hire two bakery specialists and produce more baked goods in order to meet supermarkets' orders. He requests a loan to purchase necessary bakery equipment and ingredients for his business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

N. is 49 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Tuv province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. His two oldest children are 26 and 24 years old and they both go to universities in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The youngest son is 19-year-old and goes to a local secondary school. Davhardavaa has a small family business retailing coal. He owns a truck that he uses for transporting coal from the mining site to the town. He runs the coal retail business with his wife and his children. Once he brings the coal from the mine, his wife sells it by the bag to local families who use the coal to heat their houses and cook their food. Coal retail is a good business, especially during a cold season like winter, he says. He has been doing this coal retail business since 2004 and been quite successful. He says that he aims to purchase a house for his family with the accumulated earnings from his business. He requests a loan to purchase more coal for his business. \r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Marcos.\r\n\r\nFlorentina is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Florentina owns & operates a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Florentina has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Florentina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florentina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Florentina is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Florentina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. About ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He was introduced to Kadet through an existing Kadet client. Geoffrey has no loan history with any other MFIs. \r\n\r\nHe has been selling Irish potatoes for the past seven years. He is planning to purchase more stock of Irish potatoes as the season has high demand for the product.

O. is 27 years old, married with three children.

She is 44 years old. Leonora is married and has 12 adult-aged children. \r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Leonora owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nLeonora joined HSPFI earlier this year in an effort to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Leonora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nLeonora is requesting a new loan in the amount of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Leonora from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a married woman and the mother of one child aged 13, and her husband has immigrated. Ms. Khardiata is very well known because she has been involved for a long time with a dance troupe based in Yoff, named Gualgui de Yoff. Ms. Khardiata learned that she could make use of this fame, and since May 2009 she has devoted herself to the sale of cosmetics, dressmaking supplies, fabric, and various other items. As a result, she is seeking a loan of 500,000 frs, with the goal of strengthening her stock and acquiring new supplies, given the upcoming preparations for the holidays of Tabaski and New Year's. Ms. N. lives in her family house and has 5 people in her care. She participates a lot in providing for the daily expenses. The increase in her income will allow her to better help this family improve their social and living conditions.\r\nAlways with the goal of actively participating in the struggle against poverty,

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 50 years old and widow. One of her children works for a company in the Manhi\u00e7a District. She left school just after the fourth grade, because the family could not afford her education. She lives in her own house with her children and she is not providing for anyone else. \r\nShe left the District of  Boane in 1994 and moved for a job to the city of Matola; after ending her contract she returned to Boane and started a business. She has been the owner of her business since 2004 and she has started learning this activity through her friends, in order to be able to provide for the family needs. She works approximately 10 hours every day, she does not have any employees, and she is making a monthly revenue of 3.000 MZN. Besides, she receives, from an old institution where she worked in the past, a 1.000 MZN pension that she uses for the household expenses and for savings in Xitique, a traditional rotational savings system.\r\nIn the past, she already received loans from other financial institutions (Gu\u00ea GueGue association); later she found out about Hluvuku, when she went to ask about lending conditions at the just inaugurated office. This is her second loan of the amount of 15.000 MZN, that she will use to buy construction materials (cement, stones, sand and iron) to enlarge her house. The amount of her previous loan was 11.000 MZN, that she invested as well in her house. \r\nIn the future she is planning to request further loans to build houses to rent next to her house, to increase her revenue and improve the living standards of her family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by MONICA URBAN, Kiva

In 1990 Ronalyn started making embroidered pillows, bags and other products.  She enjoyed her business and is very skillful in machine embroidery.  As she became known for the quality of her work, her customer-base grew.  It became apparent that she needed more capital to fill orders from her growing clientele. This is why she joined the NWTF Project Dungganon in 2002.  Ronalyn is happy because she is doing something that she loves while earning additional income of at least PHP 2,500 a month.\r\n\r\nRonalyn's Previous loan of Php 19,500 was used as additional capital for her business. Because she used the loan wisely in her business, she was able to pay off her weekly installments on time until she paid the loan in full.  Now for her 15th cycle loan, she wants to borrow another PHP 19,500 so she can continue her embroidery business.\r\n -------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project  &lt;i&gt;Dungganon&lt;\/i&gt; (a Hiligaynon word that means  &lt;u&gt;Honorable&lt;\/u&gt;). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

This was his source of income when he and Ninda were married and started their family. Back then with four young children, they found themselves in dire straits living well below the poverty line, sometimes having no food to feed their children. It was then that Ninda became determined to raise her children's quality of life by earning her own income to help her husband support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000, she decided to try her luck and applied to join NWTF Project Dungganon so that she could get good business advice and guidance if she were accepted as a member. She passed all the necessary requirements, and with her first loan she built a sari-sari (general store) adjacent to their house. Once she had saved up enough, she widened the variety of goods she sold in her store. With the help of her income from her general store, Ninda's children were able to go to school and finish their college education.

As\u00ed nos lo hicieron saber. \nRoc\u00edo  que es la mas entusiasta del grupo, la  suegra do\u00f1a Clarita la cual  es una persona de la tercera edad y muy seria por cierto se dedica a la venta de cacahuate y alfarer\u00eda, Do\u00f1a celia que es la mas platicota tiene un puesto de antojitos y do\u00f1a Edith que tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y fabricaci\u00f3n de obleas,  creen que con  el apoyo  que se les brindo, pueden sacar adelante sus negocios, Roci\u00f3 esta interesa en permanecer mas tiempo por que desea comprar otra maquina para hacer obleas y as\u00ed tener la posibilidad de  incrementar su producci\u00f3n.\nElla elabora sus obleas que es un dulce tipo de la regi\u00f3n aparte de la palanquetas que tambi\u00e9n se elaboran en esta localidad, las obleas pueden ser rellenas de semillas de pepita con miel o solas, \u00a1Por cierto que son muy ricas!\u2026 Roci\u00f3 nos comparte el modo de preparar la mezcla que utiliza fabricar  sus obleas:   \n   Primero.  En bote de 19  litros, vierte Agua natural, le vierte la medida de 2 cubetas peque\u00f1a con harina, despu\u00e9s de que se mezcla por 10 minutos el agua y la harina, le vierte el colorante (2 cucharitas soperas) y al final le agrega como 2 ml. de aceite comestible y lo deja batiendo por 20 minutos.\n    Posteriormente ya con una temperatura de 30 grados le vierten una cuchara grande la masa que se mezclo, cierran el molde por 2 o 3 minutos m\u00e1ximo y sacan la hoja de oblea cocida y as\u00ed sucesivamente hasta producir una cantidad considerada de bolsas con obleas.   (Mas o menos se fabricaran como 10 bolsa en 5 horas ya que su maquina cuenta con 4 moldes para producir sus obleas.\nSu negocio no cuenta con un nombre ya que su localidad es conocida por producir este dulce, desde hace 3 a\u00f1os que ella tiene este negocio. Aprendi\u00f3 este oficio desde que contaba con 16 a\u00f1os, trabajo como empleada con otros vecinos de su misma calle y se animo a tener su propio negocio. Se caso con el Sr. LUIS ALBERTO R. R. el en su empleo anterior fue polic\u00eda municipal, pero al ver que su esposa Roci\u00f3 no se daba abasto con el trabajo decidi\u00f3 salirse de ah\u00ed y entre los dos emprenden Y sacar a delante la microempresa que ya hab\u00eda iniciado Roci\u00f3, su esposa. \n  Su f\u00e1brica se encuentra en su propio domicilio, ya que no han podido comprar o rentar un local para acondicionarlo como f\u00e1brica, pero en su domicilio se dio a la tarea de acondicionar  un cuartito para trabajar.\nPara ella es muy importante sacar adelante su microempresa por que de ello se mantienen y han salido adelante con sus ventas.\nEl orgullo que tiene que con  el seguir\u00e1 adelante y que pueden salir por si mismos como familia. El orgullo que tiene es poder haber logrado comprar su maquina (herramienta de trabajo) para producir su mercanc\u00eda.\nPor semana atiende a dos compradores que se llevan no m\u00e1s de 50 bolsas llenas de obleas de diferentes colores. Su mas grande desafi\u00f3 es por que en su localidad la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes se dedican a producir este dulce y tambi\u00e9n por que el costo del recibo de luz que les llega es muy grande, aparte de que solo hay un transformador en su calle y seguido se quema constantemente, Roci\u00f3 cree que es necesario que se ponga otro mas para que as\u00ed se de abasto la electricidad.

Amilcingo is in Temoac municipality (in the state of Morelos).  It\u2019s population is 3195 and is at an altitude of 1500 meters.  The meaning of the word \u201cTemoac\u201d, which is the municipal head, is \u201cPlace where the water comes down from.\u201d Temoac, \u201cbujak\u201d from the heights \u201cwater\u201d and from ko, the adverbial form of \u201cplace\u201d which means \u201cin lower water\u201d since the teocalli (a pyramidal mound on which the Aztecs celebrated their sacrifices) that possibly exited where there is now a Catholic church was on a hilltop.  Other localities near Amilcingo: Campo Santa Lucia, el Puente Nuevo, Huazulco.  Well, on this occasion we will speak of the GERANIOS (FLAT) group which is made up of four persons:  ROCIO HUMBERTA R. N., EDITH R. F., CELIA F. R., and CLARA ANTONIA R. R..  We will now speak of Mrs. Rocio R. N..  She is from Amilcingo and is 24 years old.  She, like so many others, does not know the meaning of her name.  She finished third grade at GENERAL EMILIANO ZAPATA elementary school.  The funds requested from Fundacion Realidad will be used to buy sacks of flour, paint, plastic bags, cooking oil, adhesive tape, sandpaper to make obleas (round sweets made with two thin, wafer-like sheets with filling between them).  She and her companions learned that Fundacion Realidad offers group loans to groups with few members at the beginning and that they charge affordable interest rates and have easy payment plans.  They decided to participate because they liked the way they would work with the methodology of the fundacion and because the qualifying requirements are few.  That\u2019s what they told us.  Rocio is the most enthusiastic group member.  Her mother-in-law, Clarita, is a senior citizen and she\u2019s very serious, by the way; she sells peanuts and pottery.  Celia, who is the most talkative of the group, has a snack stand and Edith also makes obleas.  They believe that the help they get will allow them to see their businesses progress.  Rocio in interested in staying the longest because she wants to buy another oblea-making machine so that her production will increase.  She makes obleas, which are a typical sweet of this region besides the palanquetas (a type of brittle) which are also made in this region.  Obleas can be filled with pumpkin seeds in honey or plain.  By the way, they are delicious!  Rocio shares with us her method of preparing her oblea mixture:  First, she pours water into a 19 liter container.  She adds two small buckets of flour.  The flour and water are mixed for about 10 minutes and the coloring (two tablespoons) is added.  Finally, she adds about 2ml. of cooking oil and she leaves it mixing for 20 more minutes.  Then, when the temperature (of the oblea maker \u2013 similar to a waffle iron) reaches 30 degrees she places a large spoonful of the mixed dough.  The mold is closed for 2 or 3 minutes maximum and the cooked oblea sheet is ready.  They continue this way until a sufficient number of obleas to fill several bags has been produced.  (More or less they make about 10 bags in 5 hours because their machine has 4 molds available.)  Her business doesn\u2019t have a name because her locality is well-known for making this particular sweet; she has had this business for 3 years.  She learned this skill when she was 16 years old.  She worked for some neighbors on her street that had the same kind of business and she was inspired to open her own business.  She married LUIS ALBERTO R. R., who used to be a police officer.  However, when he saw that his wife couldn\u2019t cope with her work alone, he joined her and together they run the microenterprise that his wife started.  Their factory is located in their own home because they haven\u2019t been able to buy or lease a place that they can equip as a factory.  However, he took on the task of conditioning a room in his home from which to work.  It is very important for her to see her business succeed because it is their source of income and they have been able to do well with their sales.  She is very proud that she has been able to do well with it and that it provides for her family\u2019s well-being.  She is proud to have been able to purchase her machine, which is her primary work tool, to produce her merchandise.  Every week she provides two buyers that take 50 bags each full of obleas of different colors.  Her greatest challenge is that most of the inhabitants of her locality are involved in the production of this very same sweet and because electricity costs are very high.  To make matters worse, there is only one electric transformer on her street and it often shorts out.  Rocio thinks it\u2019s necessary to install another one so that there will be enough electric power for everyone. In addition, prices of her raw materials have risen.  She would like to grow more, have a good supply of raw materials.  They need their profits not only to reinvest into the business but also to buy the food they eat and their clothing.  She would also like to have a larger space so that she can get newer machinery and that the fundacion continue to support her with loans to increase her production.  She has two sons:  the elder is LUIS ANTONIO R. R. and is in first grade, and the youngest, whom they call Lupillo, is JOSE GUADALUPE R. R. and is in pre-school.  He is very little but very restless.  Also living with her are her mother-in-law, who is also a group member, her father-in-law, and her sister-in-law, who is studying to be a teacher.  Rocio\u2019s hope for the future is to provide her children a quality of life better than the one she had and to provide them with enough education since she was unable to continue with her schooling.  She is happy with this financing because they don\u2019t charge high interest rates and she already saw that the fundacion does, in fact, help out with loans.  She feels proud, but nervous at the same time, because now everyone will know who Rocio R. N. is and what she does.  She is grateful too to Fundacion Realidad for the support it gives by granting the loans.  In her own words she says:  \u201cTHANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN US.  WE WILL FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH THE REPAYMENTS.  WE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.\u201d<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":437942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy ingredients to make obleas (round sweets made with two thin, wafer-like sheets with filling between them).

The town has several approaches but the easiest and nearest is via the Mexico-Oaxaca highway.  When you reach the turn-off marked \u201cTlayecac-Amayuca\u201d turn right and follow that road all the way to the town of Tlayecac.  Agriculture is the main activity in this town, especially corn and sorghum, which is cultivated by 195 farmers on 1234 hectares.  The most common livestock is sheep, pigs and goats.  Among other important activities is commerce because the industrial zone that provides employment in the region is located here; the distance to the municipal seat is 135km.  This town is home to the Tlayecac communal bank in which most of the members are engaged in commerce.  This group is in its ninth loan cycle with FUNDACION REALIDAD although they took a couple of cycles off because sales were low and they preferred to wait so they have just now gotten their 9th loan in order to stock up for the December season.  Ambrosia M. Z. has been a group member since its founding in 2006.  She is married and has 4 children, two of whom are students and two are employed.  She requested 6000 pesos this cycle which will be invested in her grocery store to buy eggs, milk, chicken, bread, sugar, salt, soft-drinks, Sabritas, etc.  Her business is located at #28 24 de febrero street in Tlayecac.  She tells us that she has over 200 customers per day because her store is on one of the main avenues and near CECYTE (State-run technological high-schools) so many students stop by to buy from her.  She relates that her business has faced some challenges but they haven\u2019t caved in and have continued forward despite having a store open across the street from her two years ago.  At first, the competition cut all its prices so all her customers went there but, eventually, that store went bankrupt and her customers returned to her.  Her greatest wish is to open another store on another one of Tlayecac\u2019s streets that she can leave to her grandson, who is still a little boy, but who is her main purpose in life and her motivation to continue working because her daughter is a single mother and Ambrosia supports her in every way.  Finally, she is grateful to Fundacion Realidad for continuing to believe in them and for letting them return, having taken some time off, without any problems.  She is also grateful to Kiva for helping the Fundacion so that it can continue to help people who truly need credit in order to see their businesses grow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

V. has three wishes she hopes to fulfill in the next few years:  first, that her youngest son  finish his studies and get a good job; second, to be able to purchase additional appliances for her home; and third, to expand her business so that she can ultimately improve her family's living conditions. Zaida is 50 years old. Her husband, Ernesto, works as a tricycle driver and also helps manage their duck-raising business. They have four children with one still attending school. The family lives in the village of Mambagaton, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nZaida raises ducks and sells the duck eggs to several regular customers in nearby villages, towns and cities. She thought of this business because their location is very conducive to duck raising with mostly farmlands in the surrounding area.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2003, she joined NWTF Project Dungganon to access additional capital for her business. When she received her loan, she used it to buy more ducks and feed. Now her operation is big enough that she has hired a caretaker to watch the ducks (she now has more than 350 ducks and they produce more than 200 eggs per day). She now earns a monthly income of about 24,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) and she saves most of this for the education of her youngest son and also to defray household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of 19,500 PHP was used as additional capital for her duck-raising business. She was able to repay her loan on time and in full without delays, and she has maintained her good record. Now on her 14th loan cycle, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP which she intends to use as working capital so that she can buy eggs from other duck raisers to meet the demand of her customers.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

M. S., 47, has been in the direct selling business for three years. Aside from direct selling, she also sells mobile phone prepaid credits, generic medicines, and toiletry products as a source of added income. She is the busy mother of three children: one is now enrolled in college while the other two are in high school. She is married to Rolando S., who is a regular employee in a private company. She has made a point (especially now that her children are all grown up) to venture into direct selling of shoes and other apparel to help them with their daily needs. \r\n<p>\r\nTeresita has been a member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT)* for more than four years now, and she has received seven consecutive loans because of her good repayment rate. She wants to apply for a 17,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) loan so that she can buy more products to sell to her clients living in Dasmari\u00f1as Cavite, a province just south of Manila. \r\n<p>\r\nTeresita dreams that someday she will have her own boutique where she can display all her products so that her clients can easily shop. She prays that through her added contribution to their monthly income, she and her husband will save enough money so that they can renovate their house and enable their children to finish their studies and graduate from college.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the market. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2009, Agnes joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\n\nAbout GDMPC:\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

B. is 50 years old and lives with his wife and nine children in Uvs province, one of Mongolia's western provinces. He has a big family and his nine children's ages range from 23 to 1. His four oldest children all work for private companies in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. One child is with his grandparents and herds livestock in the countryside. The other three children go to local secondary school and the youngest son is just 1 year old and stays at home with his mother. <p>\r\n\r\nJamyanhorol bought an old truck two years ago and he has been carrying various freights in the town by request. Besides his truck business, he makes traditional ovens with metal and sells them to locals. He says that he works hard to make sure his big family does well. He would like to see all his children grow up well and be successful with their lives. <p>\r\n\r\nHe requests a loan to purchase a motor for his truck and metal for his oven-making business.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank<p>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

S. is from the town of San Roque Dapdap, Bamban Tarlac.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Perly has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Perly joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Perly is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Perly from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<p>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, N. operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chickens for sale.  N. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 2.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2004, N. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. N. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.028.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. N. is now requesting a new loan of 5.014.000 VND which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. The loan will be the seventh loan taken out by N. from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is from the town of Lawy, Capas Tarlac. She is 47 years old. Alma is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector selling vegetables. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling different kinds of vegetables in the local community. Alma has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Alma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used for additional capital to buy more vegetables to sell. Alma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to buy additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixteenth loan taken out by Alma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Mai is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by SEDA.  WhiL. each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsibL. for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Ph\u1ed1 Ch\u1ee3 (3).\n\nMai is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, Mai owns & operates a general store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Mai has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Mai joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mai has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2.204.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.

F. is from the village of Tucal, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 41 years old. Maricris is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Maricris owns & operates a general store where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Maricris has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Maricris joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricris has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Maricris is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Maricris from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":446574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
