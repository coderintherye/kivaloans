Although Mrs. Mey U. and her husband have different businesses, they still live in poor conditions. Therefore, Mrs. Mey U. decided to ask for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. She is 37 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom is a construction worker while the others attend the local school. \r\n\r\nOne of the members in this group loan has an end-of-term loan, so this member is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Concurrently, she initiated selling various articles, namely canned foods, pasta, and soap.  She finally had to abandon sewing in favor of commerce, which brings in more income for her.

She finally decided to engage in the buying and selling of wooden objects made locally by metal-workers, such as mortars, stools, grain huskers, stirrers, etc. She has been doing this for 5 years now. A mortar is a receptacle made of wood used by women (indispensable for rural folk) to husk, break, and grind cereals, condiments, etc. <P>\r\n\r\nEnjoying great popularity, she is much sought after, especially around the beginning of the off-season when women do a lot of buying as they set up trousseaus for their daughters (since in Bambara culture in general and that of Malians in particular a woman without a mortar is like a farmer without a plow) de leurs filles (car dans la mentalit\u00e9 bambara en g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et celle des maliens en particulier une femme qui n\u2019a pas de mortier dans son trousseau de mariage est comme un cultivateur sans charrue). Besides her principal business, she also sells charcoal and honey.<P>\r\n\r\nSo as to build up her inventory to avoid running out of something, she came to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom she has been working for 3 years. After three group loans (solidarity loans) and one individual loan, all correctly reimbursed, she is on her second individual loan which she will use to buy 15 mortars, 7 sacks of charcoal, and 20 liters of honey. <P>\r\n\r\n Mrs. Assitan Sidib\u00e9 does her buying in Tissala, one of the neighboring villages of the town of S\u00e9gou from blacksmiths specialized in working with wood (for the mortars), rural folk who keep bees for her honey, and those who have an authorisation to cut wood as far as the charcoal is concerned. She sells for cash or on credit to a clientele composed of women and men. \r\n\r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 F CFA which will be used to make repayments on the loan and for her own needs. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She is 45 years of age and lives with her children N\u00e9lida, a 22 year-old, Ivan, a 17 year-old, and Yesica, an 8 year-old.  She works in the sale of liquor which she brings from other cities.  She has done this work for 20 years, time in which she has done well and continues prospering.  Irma likes the sale of liquor now that it is highly consumed in the city and she almost always sells all of her merchandise.  What is difficult is transporting the liquor as sometimes, with the movement of the vehicles, bottles end up breaking.  Irma knows that she will continue working to be able to provide her children with the best opportunities.  With the money from this loan she will buy liquor and will travel to acquire more.

Lo mas dif\u00edcil es tener que trabajar y estar pendiente de su hija, que ya est\u00e1 en una etapa muy inquieta, pero lo bueno de esta actividad es que le permite ganar dinero extra al que gana su pareja para la manutenci\u00f3n de la peque\u00f1a Ariane.

She has worked selling salchipapas (french fries with sausages) for more than a year to be able to help with household expenses. She cares for her small daughter in the mornings and in the afternoon until an average of 5 to 6 in the evening she goes out to sell her salchipapas, staying until very late as she has to finish everything that has been prepared. The most difficult thing is to have to work and take care of her daughter as she is at a very active age, but the good thing about this activity is that it allows her to earn extra money in addition to what her partner earns to take care of little Ariane. With the money that she is requesting she will buy more ingredients to produce a greater quantity of salchipapas and in the future start a small restaurant.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":219706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of ingredients and materials to make salchipapas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-11T01:50:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Klery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T02:03:56Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":51.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957542,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":51.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227798,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":51.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423031,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":51.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116259,"comment":null},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":51.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011216,"comment":null},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":51.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594819,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T02:03:56Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":72299,"name":"Serapia Rosalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Serapia es una mujer que se ha dedicado a las ventas durante muchos a\u00f1os (aproximadamente 20 a\u00f1os).

She began her business selling children's clothing, and has been engaged in this kind of business for nine years. She trades in the street opposite the central market of Gisarski district. She sells all kinds of children's clothing, for infants to schoolage children, including jumpers, blankets, towels, socks, underwear, etc. Niso has a dream to increase her trade turnover and to rent a stall in the market. She regularly renews her stock, as she trades in the street and passers take interest in her goods, and she responds to the demands for a variety of goods.  She purchases her stock from the wholesale market in Korvon.  With the help of the Kiva program, Niso hopes to take a 2500 somoni loan, to buy socks.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva

Ce changement d'activit\u00e9 est intervenu du fait de la m\u00e9vente qui est devenue de plus en plus croissante avec sa pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente activit\u00e9. C'est pour augmenter le capital de la nouvelle activit\u00e9 et mieux r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de la client\u00e8le qu'elle sollicite ce troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat de 100000fcfa. Mari\u00e9, elle est m\u00e8re de quatre enfants dont seule la benjamine Sylvia est encore \u00e0 sa charge.","en":"Born on June 5, 1966 in Cotonou, Ms. Marie Cica G. is originally from Ouidah. She has never attended school nor learned a trade.  At her mother's side, she started as an adolescent selling balls of \"p\u00e2te\" , commonly called \"akassa\"  (similar to polenta made with boiled corn meal) and served with fried fish.  Seven years ago, she switched her business to selling cassava flour (gari) and two types of roasted peanuts (arachide and cacahu\u00e8te).  This switch came about in her previous business due to an accelerating drop in sales.  So, increasing the capital of her new business and better meeting customer demands are the reasons why she is requesting this third loan of 100,000 francs CFA.  Ms. G. is married and the mother of four children, of whom only the youngest, Sylvia, is still in her care.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":219941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy 2 sacks of cassava flour and a half-sack of sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-10-30T23:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Cica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T01:29:39Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T10:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9897546,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821486,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357749,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046802,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938424,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396112,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52903981,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63125985,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549462,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983251,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-31T00:29:39Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T11:12:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":72399,"name":"Tohir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tohir lives with his parents.

She comes from a very humble family, and was only able to complete her primary education.\r\n\r\nLucila has a lunch counter inside the municipal market, where she sells typical meals such as tapioca and flour pies, butifarra (a typical Paraguayan food), grilled meats, etc.  The business, already 15 years old, gives her the opportunity to pay for the primary and university education of her two children.  \r\n\r\nShe recalls that initially business was very hard, and that it took great effort to raise the capital to start her own business.  Now she has a loyal clientele in spite of the competition in her location.  Many people come to her shop to enjoy the delights that she creates, and it usually fills up on the weekends also.\r\n\r\nShe wants to buy a computer for her children, which is why she has come to Foundation Paraguay.  She desires a loan that will allow her to acquire the computer to help her children with their studies, and also to keep better control of her inventory and sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She didn\u2019t have a certificate, so she decided to study in the Academy of Our Lady of Asunci\u00f3n where she earned a dressmaking degree at 20 years of age. <p>\r\nMr. Osvaldo, was suffering from an illness that left him unemployed, so Mar\u00eda Elena started supporting the family since their older son has his own home. <p>\r\nShe is recognized for her good work and is never lacking clients. As time passed, though, her unique element of work was wearing out, preventing the timely delivery of her creations. It is because of this that she has put confidence in Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, requesting their support for the acquisition of a new sewing machine. This will allow her to continue pursuing this activity that she pursues daily with a lot of determination and dedication.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":220011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333 -57.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-11-11T21:40:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T22:28:11Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9937253,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-01T09:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860829,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20402116,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094184,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T19:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35987687,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44568902,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959260,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-26T09:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176510,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602176,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T09:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104737.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038419,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T22:28:11Z","paid_date":"2009-10-17T09:33:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":72446,"name":"Abbas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abbas is a 38-year-old man.

She rises very early every day to go to the market to purchase the essential ingredients to make tamales.  By about 11 am, she goes out to sell the prepared tamales, and also to deliver to her clientele.  She makes street sales at school entrances.  In the afternoon she returns again to wash everything that she used, and in this way she makes her daily income.  She is the sole support of her son.  Martha enjoys this work because she loves to cook and this dish is very easy for her to make.  Martha works for her son's education, she would like to see him become a successful professional.

From childhood, he's contributed to his family's income by supporting their farming and livestock business.  However, he decided more than 3 years ago to dedicate himself entirely to raising cuyes [a hamster-like animal], for which he has a skill, on the farm--a regular-sized place--where he now has around 100 cuyes.

She has enjoyed living in the countryside and breathing clean air since she was very young.   This is why she decided to make her home there and raise her six children.  Today, she only lives with her two youngest who also help her take care of the farm.  She plants potato, corn, and alfalfa which she sells at the market, and also uses to feed her livestock.  She owns two properties; in one of them she plants while the other rests for several months so that the earth recovers its nutrients and can yield a good crop once it is cultivated again.  This is how she works; she also works with her livestock, especially her cow, which she takes to far off pastures to feed in addition to the alfalfa she gives her to eat.

In Kampala\u2019s highly competitive market with thousands of boda bodas, Thomas enjoys a steady business and has regular clients.

Thomas has been a boda boda driver for ten years.\r\n<p>\r\nThomas used his savings and a small loan from Pearl Microfinance to purchase his first motorbike four years ago. He has been using loans regularly since to expand his fleet and pay for routine maintenance and repair costs.
