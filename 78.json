Day after day, she gets up at dawn to make, in addition to this tasty dish, the well-known national food <i>cau-cau<\/i>, and various hot coffees to suit the cold season. She dreams of having a big restaurant where she can prepare and server an immense variety of specials. Her efforts all go toward her dream of sending her children to the university in the city. With this loan, she will purchase more china, spoons, and cooking utensils to improve those that she has and also to improve the facility where she serves her famous chicken soup. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Delia, como siempre tan trabajadora esta presta a seguir adelante y a sentirse \u00fatil, la juventud se lleva en el coraz\u00f3n es lo que dice cada d\u00eda  y esta la raz\u00f3n por la que ha decidido vender diversos tipos de comidas, especialmente caldo de gallina hace 7 a\u00f1os, este  negocio es de su agrado porque  tambi\u00e9n tiene la oportunidad de probar un suculento caldo de gallina y compartir con los suyos.

She has now finished paying off this loan and therefore has the opportunity to get more credit.  This will be her third loan, and her credit rating is very good.

Thi Y., 32 years old, joined the Fund since 1998. Her family has 4 members: the parents and two children. Before joining the TYM Fund, her family encountered lots of difficulties because she did not own much rice field. She could earn enough food for the family after harvesting. However, being very active, Mrs. Y. borrowed money from the Fund to make rice vermicelli. Her income was stable, giving her opportunity to repay weekly. Yet, her family economy did not improve very fast. Realizing that many families in the area breed chickens and pigs, she switched to selling cattle and poultry food. So far, her family income is 200-250 USD\/month. Being confident at the improvement of her plan, this time, she wants to borrow 1200 USD to buy more cattle and poultry food to sell, increasing the income. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Y\u1ebfn, 32 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1998.

effectively. She joins the Fund since the very beginning. Her living circumstance at that time was very difficult. She and her husband only worked on the rice field and they had to send 5 children to school. At first, she borrowed 50 USD and used it in breeding animals, and selling vegetables in the market. Her life started changing when she bought a piece of land and started breeding animals, fishes and planting. After difficult years, her business is going very well. When I came down to see her, she just released a farrow of pigs and earned 1000 USD. Currently, there are 4 pigs and tons of fishes almost ready. Business is going well, her family economy is becoming stable. Her children are all grown-up and living separately. Being 58 years old, she is having a happy life. She wants to become a long-term member of the Fund so that she can borrow more money to expand her business. This time she wants to borrow 950 USD to buy more fishes and food for pigs. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nL\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean cao tu\u1ed5i nh\u1ea5t trong c\u1ee5m nh\u01b0ng ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ho\u00e0 lu\u00f4n l\u00e0 t\u1ea5m g\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111i\u1ec3n h\u00ecnh v\u1ec1 s\u1ef1 c\u1ea7n c\u00f9, ch\u1ecbu kh\u00f3 v\u00e0 s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng v\u1ed1n r\u1ea5t c\u00f3 hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3.

In 1996, she retired and her pension was not enough for her to live by. Her daily activity at that time was selling vegetables in the market. Even her low income did not help much for her living. In 2000. when the TYM Fund came to the area, she enthusiastically joined and also encouraged other people to join. Realizing the need of baby-sitters from many family, she bravely asked the authority to open a private kindergarten. Currently, her kindergarten is operating very well. It has 2 classrooms, 4 licensed teachers and 70 childrens. Many families send their kids to Hong N. kindergarten because Mrs. N. is very reliable. Her wish is to borrow money to expand her kindergarten, buy more children toys, satisfying the demands from the families. This time she wants to borrow 1200 USD.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nV\u1edbi kinh nghi\u1ec7m h\u01a1n 10 n\u0103m nu\u00f4i d\u1ea1y tr\u1ebb v\u00e0 c\u00f4ng t\u00e1c trong ng\u00e0nh gi\u00e1o d\u1ee5c, d\u1ef1 \u00e1n m\u00e0 ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ng\u00e1t, 55 tu\u1ed5i \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t trong s\u1ed1 \u00edt d\u1ef1 \u00e1n \u0111i\u1ec3n h\u00ecnh c\u1ee7a chi nh\u00e1nh n\u00f3i chung v\u00e0 c\u1ee7a ph\u01b0\u1eddng n\u00f3i ri\u00eang.

Partini membuka kantin disekolah dimana tempat suaminya mengajar. Selain itu  juga membuka usaha warung dirumahnya. Dengan modal awal Rp.1.000.000.- Partini memulai usaha ini. Jenis barang dagangan yang dijual dikantin sekolah seperti jajan tradisional, nasi, buah-buahan, minuman dan juga makanan ringan yang sangat digemari oleh anak \u2013anak. Untuk dikantin sekolah Partini berjualan dengan cara bergilir dengan istri-istri guru yang lain. Dalam satu bulan Partini mendapat giliran berdagang sebanyak 1 minggu dan kesempatan ini dipergunakan sebaik \u2013 baiknya. Partini mulai berjualan dari pagi hari sampai siang hari sesuai dengan waktu sekolah. Selanjutnya Partini berdagang dirumahnya. Untuk dirumah, Partini juga menyediakan bermacam-macam barang dagangan seperti makanan ringan, minuman dan semua kebutuhan pokok. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya, Partini berencana untuk menjual pakan ternak seperti dedak  padi dan juga dedak gandum yang sangat dibutuhkan oleh para peternak yang ada disekitar tempat tinggalnya.

Shifting periodically to avoid the sun's glare as it tracks across the sky, the women of the Belen communal bank are perched on rocks, steps or sitting flat on the ground, waiting for their meeting to begin.  They have come from all over their town of Cerro de Oro, by foot, tuc tuc, or bus, to this central spot where they have been meeting once a month for the past seven years.  Surrounded by poverty, this avocado tree brings them hope with each meeting.  It is under this tree that they receive their loans from Friendship Bridge and learn how to best invest to change their futures.  \r\n\r\n<P>The majority of the 28 women are artisans, born and raised in a region known for its beautiful weavings. Of the 28 women, 11 are asking for a loan of 32,500 quetzales ($4,275), ranging from $300 to $400 per person.  All of these women will invest their loans in weaving and embroidery businesses, purchasing thread and fabric for intricate huipiles (traditional woven blouses, like the ones in the picture), skirts, scarves, and blankets.  The supplies they purchase come from the nearby town of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n.  One woman also sells firewood, the main source of fuel in the area, to supplement her weaving business.  She will use about 25% of her loan to invest in firewood.\r\n\r\n<P>Long before the monthly meetings under the avocado tree, the women of Belen worked long days in the factories of other weavers, earning meager incomes that could barely provide food or shelter for their families.  Since joining Friendship Bridge, all 28 women have become their own bosses, opening their own businesses,  employing as many as five other women in turn. They are also teaching their daughters the trade, which is an important aspect of the Atitl\u00e1n culture.  However, their dreams go further for their children.  Their children all attend the local school, and their mothers dream that they will learn to read and write, acquiring knowledge of other things, so that someday they can break free from the struggles of their parents and enter a world full of opportunity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":134642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase

Cerro De Oro (Group 2)","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<P>The road into Cerro de Oro cuts through lush forests, passing by men with machetes chopping away, others carrying their day\u2019s gatherings on their backs to be sold as firewood in town.  Along the forests are thousands of rocks, several serving as billboards for political slogans, too many others as memorials.  The road opens up to an emerging little town, with a school on the right, and an avocado tree on the left.  Underneath the avocado tree sit 28 women, vying for the relief its branches offer from the unforgiving sun.  They have gathered here once a month for the past seven years.  The women of the Belen communal bank have overcome insurmountable odds, one loan at a time.  \r\n\r\n<P>The women of Belen come from a region rich in weaving, and many grew up learning the intricate art from their parents.  From the time they were young, they were working for meager wages in weaving factories, earning barely enough to survive, with no way to get ahead.  After joining Friendship Bridge, they were given the initial push they needed to escape their poverty.  Today, seven years later, every single woman has her own weaving business, earning a fair income that supports their families and even enough to send all their children to school.  They wear this success with a humble pride, supporting each other in their victories and obstacles.  \r\n\r\n<P>Ten of the 28 women are asking for a loan of 28,000 quetzales ($3,675), ranging from $300 to $400 per person.  Nine of the women will invest this money in their weaving businesses, purchasing thread to weave intricate huipiles (traditional blouses like the ones in the picture), skirts, scarves, and blankets.  A single huipil can take up to a month to make, and after an initial investment of about 200 quetzales ($25), it can be sold for around 500 quetzales ($65).  All the supplies are purchased in the nearby town of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n.  A few of the women also employ as many as five other women, and part of the loan will go towards paying their salaries. Having the extra help greatly increases production (which is essential when a single product takes a month to make), and therefore adds significantly to the potential income.  One woman also runs a small store, selling snacks, soft drinks and daily necessities such as soap and toilet paper.  She plans to restock her store and add new varieties of snacks to keep her customers interested.\r\n\r\n<P>The women of Belen have come very far over the past seven years and they don\u2019t plan on stopping. They want to expand their businesses; the ones who currently work alone would like to someday hire help.  They would also like to expand to other nearby markets, bringing in new customers.  Everything they do is for the future of their children, and their dreams revolve around educating their children, with the hope that they can learn to read and write, and someday become professionals, free of the hardships of their parents."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3675,"image":{"id":134646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase

Francisca is from the community of Rancha, which is a little town outsiD. the city of Ayacucho.  Francisca travels to different markets in the region where she sells fruits and homemaD. breads.  From the markets, she buys meat and cheeses that she sells in the city of Ayacucho and sometimes in the city of Lima.  Recently, Francisca started a new business raising chickens and pigs.\r\n<P>\r\nCirila is 50 years old.  She is married and has eight children, three of whom live with her.  Cirila buys chesses from various markets around the region of Ayacucho.

She currently lives with her husband at Y Yen District of Nam Dinh Province.  She has two children who have both grown up and have a job of their own.  In the previous loans, Mrs. B. put the money in her pig-breeding and recycling materials businesses.  The majority of her own money was used for the pig-breeding business, which is also the main source of her family's income.  Normally she would be able to sell each farrow of pigs for about 500 to 700 USD.  At the same time, by collecting recycling materials and resell it, she got enough money to pay the monthly payment (for TYM) as well as for the household daily activities.  In 2004, seeing that her age would not allow her to continue with this work anymore, she moved into the husking rice business.  This business has been doing quite well, with her monthly income of around 150 USD.  In this loan cycle, she would like to ask for a loan of 450 USD to buy petroleum and repair her machines.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 11px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by Anh H.

In early 2007, she took out a 200USD loan from the TYM Fund to expand her pig farm. At the end of the year, the income improves a little. Though not much but that encourages her to take out more loan. She is applying for a loan of 400USD to buy piglets.
