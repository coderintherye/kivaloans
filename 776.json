The couple has been blessed with two children who are still too young for school.

She has been operating her store for three years and her transportation business for one year. She is glad because she is able to earn a living. Marissa would like to increase her income because she is aiming to start another business. \r\n\r\nThe income generated from the transportation business was used to cover their household expenses, allowances and school fees for her two children. So her capital is no longer enough. For that reason, she would like to take out a loan in the amount of PHP 10,000 which will mostly be used for the repair and maintenance of her motorcycle (some will be used for her store). She hopes that she can get this amount so that her dreams will be attainable.\r\n\r\nMarissa believes that her businesses will continue to grow through the continued financial support of Kiva lenders.

Nevertheless, she has confronted various adversities in her life in which she had to resort to seeing her dreams postponed.\n\nLuz Dary, with the goal of being able to generate higher income, has set up a fast-food stand that her customers mention as being of very good quality.  Since the fast-food business has gone so well for her, Luz Dary wants her fast-food stand to offer a greater variety of products than what she currently offers, so she wants to buy a double deep fryer that will allow her to make more fast food at the same time.\n\nHowever, Luz Dary does not have the necessary capital for this.  She hopes a loan will give her the opportunity to succeed in buying a double deep fryer and the necessary supplies to make her food the first days.\n\nLuz Dary hopes that in this way her income will go up considerably and she can realize her dream of giving her children a university education and improve their quality of life.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":39.15,"image":{"id":986563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a double deep fryer that allows her to prepare more food to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-01T08:01:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-02T08:01:27Z","loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Dary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":71182},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73190},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75255},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77377},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":79560},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81805},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84112},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86485},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88925},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91433},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94012},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96664}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.15,"local_amount":71182,"processed_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":71918.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362204,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T17:06:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382745,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is a hog raiser in her village.
