is Rowena B., 41, a resident of Brgy. Bautista, Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Wilson B., a landscaping artist, and is the mother of six children. Three of them are studying at high school, two are in elementary grades and the other one is in college.  \r\n\r\nAt this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Rowena, as she herself was an elementary graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRowena has been managing her own landscaping business for quite some time now. She is partnering with her husband in operating this business. Rowena offers landscaping services to individuals who desire to beautify their home gardens. She also sells ornamental plants and other landscaping materials for hobbyists and even schools in her local community. Rowena earns an estimated net income of 12,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business to buy supplies and other materials for their landscaping needs.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

B. is from the village of Kulasihan, Lantapan, Bukidnon. She is 39 years old. Dora is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Dora owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, instant noodles, detergents, shampoo, soap & ready-to-wear clothing in the local community. Dora has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 14,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Dora joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Dora is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products, such as canned goods and junk foods. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Dora from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is from the village of Poblacion, Lantapan, Bukidnon. She is 47 years old. Cerelina is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Cerelina owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, junk foods, detergents, shampoo, soap & beverages in the local community. Cerelina has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cerelina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cerelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Cerelina is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods and junk foods. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Cerelina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She finished high school and decided to run a rice retailing outlet as a source of income for her family. \r\n\r\nAdelina has been operating a rice retailing business for quite some time now. She buys sacks of rice at a wholesale price and retails the same per kilo with minimum mark up. In the Philippines, almost all Filipinos are rice consumers since rice has always been a part of their daily meals. Serving her local community, Adelina earns an estimated net income of around 12,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) a month. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more sacks of rice for retailing. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAdelina always desires a happy and abundant life. She prays that her business will continue to grow and be of help not only to her family but also to her relatives and neighbors. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting* where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studied. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis.

is Teresita S., 49, a resident of San Andres 2, Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Rolando S., an employee of a private firm, and is the mother of three children. One of their children is in high school, while the other two not yet of school age. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Teresita, as she herself has been a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children. \r\n\r\nTeresita has been in the direct sales business for almost three years now. She sells branded cosmetics, apparel, footwear, household detergents, and other personal products. She allows her customers to order from her based on a product catalog, then orders these items from the company office at a discounted price. Monthly, Teresita earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy items ordered in advance by her customers like cosmetics and apparels. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She prays that her business will become successful and aims for financial stability someday. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting* where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

A., 29, a resident of San Nicolas III, Bacoor, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Sanly Sta. A., a waiter, and is the mother of three children. Two of her children are in elementary school, while the other one is not yet of school age. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Cherryl, as she herself has been a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children. \r\n\r\nCherryl operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos 'worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCherryl dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business.

She will increase her stock of her goods with her next loan by buying mushrooms, peanuts and caterpillars and reselling them at profit. Her business brings in 50 USD of profit each week. Her dream is to someday open a general store in her environment. Rose is 51 years old, widowed, and the mother of 6 children, whose ages vary between 12 and 30 years old. Four of them attend school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":754680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to increase the

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kulmai T., 53, is the leader of this group. She is married to a worker in a local state inspection and has four grown children. The younger kids along with her husband help her in preparing fodder for their livestock. Following the example of most of her friends, she took a loan from a local bank and started up her business of cattle breeding. That helped Kulmai to buy her first cow and equipment for work on a small plot of  land that she owns and gradually build a house. Unfortunately, 2,000 soms of monthly income is not enough to purchase the planned five head of livestock. With this purpose, Kulmai turned to Kiva lenders in search of support.\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

A. is from the village of Taglimao, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 33 years old. Emmalyn is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Emmalyn owns & operates a business venture in the food sector butchering and selling meat in the market. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from butchering & selling pork and poultry meat in the market. Emmalyn has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Emmalyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Emmalyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional meat & working capital. Emmalyn is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional pork and poultry meat. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Emmalyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Janet is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, detergents & beverages. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Janet from HSPFI.

S. is a 47-year-old, married woman from the village of Thailand, Banisilan, South Cotabato. She and her husband have four adult-age children. To earn a living, Lucy owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector. Specifically, she runs a sari-sari (variety) shop, and her primary source of income is derived from buying and selling canned goods, junk food, beverages, shampoo, soap, and biscuits in the local community. Lucy has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP per month from these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lucy joined HSPFI to gain much-needed access to financial services. As a result, she was better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her family's standard of living. Recently, Lucy successfully repaid a loan in the amount of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and for working capital purposes.

the past four years, Abena G. has been selling gari and kenkey in her village Mfuom, near Abura town in the Central Region.  Gari is a Ghanaian staple painstakingly made from cassava and can be eaten in a variety of ways. Kenkey is another staple made from fermented cassava and corn dough. \r\n\r\nAbena is married and has six children.  Her sale of gari and kenkey supplements her husband\u2019s income as a farmer. She helps pay the cost of sending their children to school \u2013 mainly school uniforms and books, and also some of the utilities bills. \r\n\r\nIn order to save up for higher education fees for her children, Abena needs to increase her earnings.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippines pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. Along with her variety store, she also sells viands (cooked dishes) to her neighbors. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan.  She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMylene hopes that her business will continue to grow and be able to send her children all the way through college.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send the rest of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Marilyn, as she herself has been only through elementary school and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is into the buying and selling of dried fish and smoked fish for quite some time now. She orders these items in large quantities from an individual who dries and smokes the fish.  She repacks the same into 5 PHP to 20 PHP packs for sale.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of around $260.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy dried and smoked fish for her every day inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Upon the request of customers, she also provides home service, doing manicures, pedicures, haircuts, hairdressing and make-up. She also sells cosmetics offered by direct-selling companies like Avon and Sara Lee. Monthly, Elizabeth earns an estimated net income of around 12,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 48,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more supplies and new equipment needed for her salon operation. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes that her business will continue to grow and she will be able to send her youngest child to college.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is Susana S., 44, a resident of C. Jose St., Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Cerilo S., a janitor, and is the mother of two children who are studying in college while the other one is already working. \r\n\r\nAt this time, she is working hard to be able to send her youngest child all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Susana, as she herself is a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSusana operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP\u2019s-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusana hopes that her business will become bigger and she will be able to build a bigger commercial place. She also prays for having their own house and lot for her family. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group\u2019s weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n \r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sojidamo is a hard-working woman who is married and has four children. Her husband and son help her in her grocery sales business. She lives near the market of Sakhovat.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

One of them is already working and the other two are still studying. At this time, Charlita is working hard to be able to send her younger children to college, a dream for most Filipino parents like Charlita as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nCharlita is an all-around beautician and runs a small beauty salon in the comfort of her home. Upon the request of customers, she also provides home service doing manicure, pedicure, haircuts, hairdressing and make-up. She also sells cosmetics offered by direct selling companies like Avon and Sara Lee. She has been enjoying this kind of work for the last fifteen years and she now earns close to 11,000 PHP a month. She uses her earnings to answer to her family\u2019s daily needs.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan. She is planning to use this loan to purchase supplies for her beauty parlor. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCharlita hopes that her business will continue to grow and that she will be able to send all her children all the way through college. She is also desirous of having another branch of her beauty salon to manage. Charlita prays for good health and a happy life for her entire family.

Now she plans to purchase a new assortment of goods and for this she has requested a loan of 3,000 USD. \n   \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has two children who attend school and live with her. She no longer lives with her husband. She moved to Agblangandan in the town of S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji 12 years ago, and she takes care of her children alone. \r\n\r\nElisabeth never attended school. She sells cakes made from cassava flour door to door. The income earned from this activity allows her to support herself and her children.

She is 64 years old, married and mother to ten children, the eldest son being 46 years old and the youngest being 26 years old. All her ten children have got university diplomas. Her husband is an accountant in a public company, namely the National Caf\u00e9 Office (Office national du caf\u00e9 - ONC). The customer, Kapinga N. is a baker. She also has a shop in order to maximise her income. She has been carrying out her bakery business for the past 33 years. She started the business with a capital generated from the production of crop from the fields. This crop was worth USD 6 at the time. This new loan will allow her to get fresh supplies of basic products (20 bags of flour, sugar, yeast etc.).

She works selling clothes and accessories from her home and has been doing this for 3 years. However, owing to the earthquake of February 27th, 2010, the people here have been very scared and have had to give greater priority to more basic necessities, and therefore clothes sales have diminished. As a result she has had to expand her business by making sweet breads, wholewheat bread, and kneaded bread, and she sells these goods to the workers at a factory which means she has frequent customers. \r\nShe buys her clothes and accessories supplies in the city of Santiago and the supplies for her baking she buys in the city of Concepci\u00f3n. She also makes costume jewelry. She has been doing this for 19 years. She currently also knits and sells scarves with innovative designs that are different from the ones found in the market. Lamentably, the earthquake completely devastated her home and she lost all her work materials and had to start again with nothing. She had to buy everything and also had to move home. \r\nShe will use the loan to buy clothes, white and wholemeal flour, and oil and salt. \r\nHer greatest dreams are to pay her monthly expenses and live quietly and in harmony with her family. Hence her motivation to continue with these different businesses. \r\nPatricia lives with her daughters who are 28 and 27 years old as well as her 4 year old granddaughter. She feels very supported by her entire family.\r\nPatricia is very happy and grateful for the loan from Fondo Esperanza, as this will be invested in all her businesses and generate greater income. She also comments that Fondo Esperanza offered her a lot of help after the earthquake. With respect to the bank meetings, there is much camaraderie, and they serve as a distraction and opportunity to pass some pleasant time together.

","en":"Jos\u00e9 Am\u00edlcar P. lives in a rented house in the municipality of San Vincente in the department of the same name.  He has lived alone for a long time, and he has worked hard to get ahead.  Jose has a small eatery where he offers a variety of dishes.  He has this business in his house, and he is assisted by an employee.  In spite of the fact that Jose is an older man, he is full of dreams and goals that he says he has yet to accomplish.  He wants to improve his quality of life, and to do this he works each day with the hope and faith in God that some day he will achieve this.  This has motivated him to apply for a loan from INTEGRAL so that he can invest in his small business and be able to offer his customers a greater variety of dishes, so that each day they will prefer his business more.  He will use this loan to buy supplies such as: rice, beans, vegetables, meats, coffee, fruit, etc.  In this way he hopes to have better earnings that will allow him to have a better quality of

Through her business, Maria Esperanza is also able to support her children and prepare them for a successful future, something she and her husband both dream of. \r\n\r\nMaria's business activities include making custom women's clothing and selling various requested products. With her Kiva loan, which is her primary source of financing, Maria Esperanza will buy fabric, thread, and sewing supplies for her tailoring business. She currently has many orders from her customers, who want elegant clothing to wear for Mother's Day. She also has outstanding orders for perfume, underwear, and cosmetics that she will use the loan to buy.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to finish work on her home and to be able to set up her business in its own location, which will provide a better shopping experience for her customers and help her gain customer loyalty.

This prevents her from being able to take advantage of growth opportunities, which is why she works with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to overcome this challenge.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":469.84,"image":{"id":755182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy fabric, thread, and sewing materials for making custom clothing and to buy perfume, underwear and cosmetics for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-04-25T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74909},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76345},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77808},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79300},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80820},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82369},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83947},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":85556},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":87196},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":88867},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90571},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":92312}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.6},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":74909,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":77444.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230583,"comment":null},{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":76345,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":78929.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509438,"comment":null},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":77808,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80441.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673658,"comment":null},{"amount":45.6,"local_amount":79300,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":81984.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320220,"comment":null},{"amount":46.47,"local_amount":80820,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83555.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803352,"comment":null},{"amount":47.36,"local_amount":82369,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":85157.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614433,"comment":null},{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":83947,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":86788.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568398,"comment":null},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":85556,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":88452.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779738,"comment":null},{"amount":50.13,"local_amount":87196,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":90147.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188156,"comment":null},{"amount":51.1,"local_amount":88867,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91875.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324385,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-26T01:23:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":292464,"name":"Ernestina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ernestina M.

What differentiates Darlene\u2019s bag from others is its design. Divided into compartments that are stacked like shelves, it is ideal for storing books, electronics, clothes and more. Set on wheels, the bag is easy to transport.\r\n\r\nThe idea of creating an ultra-efficient luggage case came to Darlene when her daughter, a sophomore in college, complained of not having an efficient bag for carrying her belongings around campus. Soon after, Darlene came up with the bag\u2019s initial design as she was driving back from a conference in Mississippi. Now, nearly a year later, Darlene has a provisional patent and a prototype (see picture) that she is in the process of refining.\r\n\r\nDarlene has hired a product design firm to help her finalize the bag\u2019s layout and composition materials. A manufacturing company will make the bag, which she hopes will begin final production within the next three to six months. This loan helps Darlene finish refining the bag\u2019s design and allows her to manufacture samples that can be physically tested. The loan also provides her with the capital to manufacture a very small initial batch of the final product.\r\n\r\nDarlene is originally from New Orleans\u2019 Lower 9th Ward. She works nights as a bridge operator, which she likes because it frees her to work with her manufacturer and design consultant during business hours. Previously, she worked at a community health clinic for the city of New Orleans, but the clinic closed after Hurricane Katrina. She is a published author, having written <u>Spend Your Last Dollar: God\u2019s Plan of Salvation<\/u>, a book that draws lessons from the Bible and applies them to everyday life.

children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2340.1,"image":{"id":755436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to
