Having left junior high school in the final year, he tried his hand unsuccessfully at various incoming-generating activities. He eventually decided to start buying and selling electrical goods (TVs, radio hi-fis, DVDs, VCDs, solar panels, satellite dishes, etc.) three years ago now. He enjoys a well-established reputation and receives a lot of orders, particularly from young people. In his search for financial assistance he is requesting the help of Soro Yiriwaso, with whom this will be his first individual loan. This will allow him to buy 2 TVs, 3 radio hi-fis, 2 solar panels, 2 satellite dishes, 2 DVDs, 3 VCDs and 100 CDs in order to meet ever-increasing customer demand. He gets his supplies in Accra (Republic of Ghana) and sells them on at his video store in Wayerma. He both sells and rents out equipment. Some of his customers pay in cash and others by credit. He intends to bring in a monthly profit of 200,000 CFA francs using this loan. Having achieved his profit target he hopes to make back the bulk of his outgoings, including family expenses, pay off the interest on his loan, and invest the rest in his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eleanor Stilgoe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":299840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of electronic equipment (TVs, radio hi-fis, CDs, DVDs and VCDs, solar satellite panels, satellite dishes etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621209,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020170,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242924,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242925,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678633,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112541,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028134,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873509,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763257,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-27T11:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T01:52:04Z","paid_date":"2010-02-27T11:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100145,"name":"Nawaf","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nawaf, 33, lives with his wife in Aley, Mount Lebanon, where he has owned a bakery for a year.

She sells a local dish called \u2018banku\u2019 in her community. She prepares the food in her house of residence and sells by the roadside in the evenings.

With the rest of the money, he will purchase cattle for the amount of 1,500.00 PEN, paying for the remaining balance with his own savings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":299924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Motorcycle taxi repair and purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-08T22:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":147.84},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":156.03},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":163.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":169.57},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":177.46},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":186.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.04,"local_amount":147.84,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":150.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012408,"comment":null},{"amount":50.71,"local_amount":156.03,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":158.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595996,"comment":null},{"amount":52.99,"local_amount":163.05,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":165.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990260,"comment":null},{"amount":55.12,"local_amount":169.57,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":172.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211384,"comment":null},{"amount":57.67,"local_amount":177.46,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":180.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640893,"comment":null},{"amount":60.47,"local_amount":186.05,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":188.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080360,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-09T13:12:23Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100189,"name":"San Juan Ollantaytambo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The San Juan Ollantaytambo Village Bank is made up of 17 members who live about 20 minutes outside the town of Ollantaytambo, in the Sacred Valley outside the city of Cusco. The group has been together for 18 months (3 loan cycles), and has just graduated from Phase I of Arariwa\u2019s group loan program, meaning that all of the group\u2019s 2,600 soles in savings (US$825) was returned.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group is now entering its first cycle of Phase II, for which it has invited four new members to join the group. All of the group members are from the same area and know one another well. Almost all of them work in agriculture or raise livestock, with the exception of the group\u2019s president, Sra. Silvia, who is a schoolteacher in Cusco, and Marina, who sells clothing. Most of the group members speak Quechua (the primary indigenous language of Peru) as a first language, which is common in the countryside in the mountains. The group\u2019s loan officer, Alfredo, also speaks Quechua, and conducts group meetings in a mix of Quechua and Spanish.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group meets in Paulina\u2019s home, which is located right next to the train tracks; each day dozens of trains pass by, taking tourists to and from Machu Picchu. Paulina is 43 years old. She has a family farm, where she grows corn, potatoes, squash, and wheat and also has eleven cows. She buys the cows young, then feeds and fattens them, and finally sells them to buyers who sell the meat in Lima.\r\n<p>\r\nPaulina is requesting a loan of 500 soles, which she plans to use to buy guinea pigs and chickens to raise. Guinea pigs are a Peruvian delicacy and relatively lucrative to raise, though they require a lot of care and attention to keep healthy. She buys each one for 15 to 20 soles, and can eventually sell them for twice as much. Chicks cost 15 soles for a pair, and after three to four months Paulina expects to sell them for twice as much. The group has pledged to repay its Kiva loan in full and on time.\r\n<p>\r\nNote: Two of the people appearing in the group photo are not members: the girl on the far left is the daughter of one of the group members, while the man seated on the ground in front is the group\u2019s loan officer, Alfredo Lopez. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":299915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds, fertilizer, small animals and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ollantaytambo - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-04-08T03:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raymundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9400,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1417.15},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1473.84},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1532.8},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1594.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1657.89},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1724.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":474.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":493.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.52},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":554.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":456.11,"local_amount":1417.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1425.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409836,"comment":null},{"amount":570.92,"local_amount":1774.1,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1784.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918277,"comment":null},{"amount":396.58,"local_amount":1232.36,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1239.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139116,"comment":null},{"amount":513,"local_amount":1594.12,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1603.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564739,"comment":null},{"amount":533.52,"local_amount":1657.89,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1667.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998334,"comment":null},{"amount":554.87,"local_amount":1724.2,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1733.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910601,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-10T17:37:20Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T14:39:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100190,"name":"Sigifredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Sigifredo R. ya ha tenido ya un cr\u00e9dito con FVP el cual lo pago puntual mente, lo utilizo para poner las protecciones de su casa.

She began the business in March of 1989. She had a type of small store where she sold basic necessities. Then she started a tortilla shop because she realized that there wasn\u2019t one in the neighborhood, and she and her neighbors had to go a long way to buy them. For a while, both businesses worked well, but then she began to have problems finding trustworthy employees, so she decided close them. A year and a half ago, she began selling house wares and with this business she has been able to establish her work schedule and she doesn\u2019t have to have a fixed schedule. \r\n\r\nWhen she began this business, she had very few customers, but she began to offer her products to friends, neighbors, and previous customers.

She is requesting a loan of MXN $3,000, and this credit will help her purchase ingredients to increase her inventory during the Easter period.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":299956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T03:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":509.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927837,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":509.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927838,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":509.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382903,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":509.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382904,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":509.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889572,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":509.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889573,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-09T06:50:21Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100204,"name":"Karin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karin es socia del Banco Comunal Azucenas.\nKarin es conviviente, tiene 32 a\u00f1os y 2 hijos, Karin tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda en su casa en donde vende golosinas, bebidas, su casa esta ubicado cerca de un terminal de buses, adem\u00e1s Karin trabaja como secretaria en la empresa de transporte.\nKarin necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de golosinas, gaseosas.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Karin son techar su casa y surtir con mas productos sus negocios.\n","en":"Karin is a member of the Azucenas Community Bank.

loan ended.  Since that time positive changes happened in her life.  Her eldest daughter, who helped Salima in her business, recently got married (she is in the photo).  This occurred due to Salima\u2019s industriousness; she did not stop working on her business despite all the difficulties.  Today in addition to her main business - purchasing and selling fruit - Salima together with her brother has started to purchase and sell small livestock.  She decided to take out a loan to fill her shortage of funds.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

S. is a 54 year-old mother of five.

Since 2007, Komiljon has supported his family through his efforts. During this time he has tried various types of activities. Finally, a year ago he started his own business selling cell phones. Komiljon believes that this business is profitable and the generated income allows him to support his family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her son Renaldo will help his father in managing their proposed business.\r\n\r\nJosefina is very grateful for the opportunities she got by joining ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), which supports her in all the dreams she has. She's proud to be one of the empowered women of today. She is very happy to be able to send her youngest daughter to college and earn a degree in order to get a better job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":300358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a used

Supplies of goods are gotten in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) and then are sold at home or door-to-door to customers composed generally of women, cash accepted and credit at times.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 200,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":300412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Massouko ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":126702.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621214,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":63351.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020175,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":63351.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242930,"comment":null},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63351.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678643,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":63351.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112546,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63351.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028135,"comment":null},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":63351.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873510,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-08T06:03:00Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100403,"name":"Levinus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Levinus is married to Carolyne and they have two children.

His first loan was used for buying items for his store and he has been profitable with this strategy. With the profits from his last loan he was able to buy a new zinc roof for his house. The profits from this loan will go towards paying his child\u2019s school fees as well as supporting other members of his family. Emmanuel takes out GHAPE loans because he gets his loan before he starts to repay it and because of the education they provide on poverty alleviation. \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

With this loan, Regina plans to purchase one bag of rice, five bags of salt, 10,000cfas (approx. $20) worth of dry fish, ten tins of gari (local vegetable), lots of onions and Maggi (a local, popular sauce used for cooking). \r\n\r\nThis is Regina's second loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2007. She thinks she has a good business that is successful. She thinks this because she sells her items to her customers on a daily basis and knows that they need what she offers.  \r\n\r\nHaving lost her son two years ago and having to pay for her daughter to go to the hospital when she fell ill, Regina has fought some battles recently. She still continues to support her children\u2019s needs through her business. With the profits of this loan, Regina wants to continue to eat better and purchase some new kitchen utensils. She prefers GHAPE loans not only because of the preferable loan conditions but also because of the business skills she was able to acquire with the GHAPE training.  \r\n  \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Such improvements required that he find other income separate from what he earned from his job working at a company.  He started his business in October of 1992.   His father had worked his whole life in transportation, so he offered Carlos a chance to work with him for a little while.  When Carlos ended up actually enjoying the work and began to do well with it, he decided to continue working in public transportation.  This earned him the extra income he needed to cover his household and family expenses.  Today Carlos works at a company during the work week and drives his taxi on the weekends.  Thanks to the taxi, things have been going very well.  He has been able to advance construction on his house, so that his family can live in greater comfort.  He needs a loan of MXN $7,000 to help him to pay road taxes and driving fees needed to remain up to date and stay out of trouble with the transportation authorities.  \r\n\r\n<br

from Claude K. in Kigali, Rwanda!  Eight years ago, Claude opened a general store in his neighborhood in the capital city of Rwanda.  He is now seeking his first microfinance loan so that he can buy more stock and better meet his customers' needs.  He is requesting a loan worth 500,000 Rwandan Francs to be repaid on a monthly basis over an 8 month period.  \r\n\r\nClaude has two employees who help him with the shop.  He works from 6:00 am to 10 pm daily, which allows him to earn approximately 200,000 Rwandan Francs each month (or 400 USD).  He is married, and his wife also owns a store nearby.  Claude is 29 years old and has three children.  He intends to use some of his profits to reinvest in his shop so that he can carry a greater variety of goods.

In spite of the her youthful difficulties, she never lost interest in her studies and through her academic determination she succeeded in completing her training in cooking and pastrymaking, and obtaining the title of professional chef.  This achievement helped her to start her own business, together with her mother, who groomed her daughter in the culinary arts.  Together now they have opened a business preparing bocaditos (hors dourves and savory snacks).  For the time being they are working out of their home because they don't have a location appropriate for their customers.  But in spite of the difficulties and limitations they are having success and getting a good reception from the public thanks to their delicious bocaditos which are prepared using the best ingredients.

In spite of being separated from her partner she always provided what was necessary for her children, and thanks to the help of her parents and family members they have a warm home in which they all live together in her parents\u2019 home. The demands of being a parent pushed her to look for work in order to manage her responsibilities. Finding an opportunity in a telephone company, she worked as promoter of sales over the last fifteen years. Then she started a more independent business, within the same company, that consists of selling prepaid telephone calls, useful to people with limited resources and scarce possibility of having a telephone in their home. In this way she helps people with limited resources have a means of communication. Doing this gives her great satisfaction, not only for the financial gain or the demand, but because she contributes to the development of her district and her city. Nevertheless, Marcela hopes in the future to set up a business selling phones and phone cards in her home to provide a full-time service while leaving the weekend to continue helping, as much as possible, people in poorer areas. This is her first loan with MFP. She is committed to being responsible and punctual, and work alongside teammates who are very dynamic and hardworking, to enable their community bank to grow. The money she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of telephones that she needs to sell in upcoming months, because in some cases the sale is by credit, and she has to cover payments for several months.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":300575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase in merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":116}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012415,"comment":null},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596003,"comment":null},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990267,"comment":null},{"amount":39.2,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211391,"comment":null},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640900,"comment":null},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080367,"comment":null},{"amount":39.86,"local_amount":116,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":125.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996558,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-10T00:37:32Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100462,"name":"Mohammed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammed A. is forty-seven years old.

Todas las madrugadas Carlos sale a comprar pescado en las playas que est\u00e1n cercanas a su hogar para luego venderlo en el mercado mayorista, pues la venta de pescado es una de las actividades m\u00e1s rentables en su localidad, debido a que los comerciantes, ya sean mayoristas o  minoristas visitan ese mercado por la calidad y cantidad de productos. Esto favorece el negocio de Carlos, pero lo dif\u00edcil es despertar a las tres de la ma\u00f1ana y salir a comprar el pescado para  luego trasladarlo al mercado, donde solo puede vender hasta las ocho de la ma\u00f1ana, ya que  los comerciantes s\u00f3lo salen desde muy temprano, y si por alg\u00fan motivos demora en llegar, tiene pocas posibilidades de acabar de vender su producto. Es por ello que en cuanto m\u00e1s pronto salga de casa, tiene mayor ventaja de terminar temprano. Con el tiempo, Carlos desea tener una asociaci\u00f3n de comerciantes pesqueros para ver la posibilidad de exportar los productos o distribuir a diversas ciudades. Carlos es fundador del grupo que desde hace tres a\u00f1os se form\u00f3 en MFP, y este es su quinto pr\u00e9stamo. Como presidente de su banco comunal tiene una grata experiencia de trabajar junto a sus compa\u00f1eras, quienes son muy trabajadoras y comprometidas, a pesar de que por algunas circunstancias se llegaron a desanimar en alg\u00fan momento, siguen trabajando juntos. Adquirir mayor cantidad de producto ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar sus ingresos, y es lo que har\u00e1 con los 1500 soles que ahora solicita. ","en":"Carlos is responsible for the maintenance of his home.  He has been able to meet his two children\u2019s needs thanks to the help of their mother.  The children have everything they need in their house where they all live as a family.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning at daybreak Carlos leave for the beaches that are closest to his home to buy fish.  He later sells them in the wholesale market.  Selling fish is one of the most profitable activities in his area because the merchants, big and small, visit this market for its quality and quantity of products.  This works to his favor.  But, it is difficult to get up at three in the morning, and leave to buy fish to later take to the market, where you can only sell until eight in the morning.  The merchants leave very early; if for any reason you are late getting there you have little chance of selling all of your fish.  Therefore, the earlier he leaves home, the better chance he has of finishing early.  \r\n\r\nIn time, Carlos would like to have a Fishermen\u2019s Merchant Association to see about the possibility of exporting or distributing products to different cities.  \r\n\r\nCarlos is the founder of the group that formed three years ago in MFP.  This is his fifth loan.  As president of his community bank he has the gratifying experience of working together with his companions. They are very hard working and committed.  In spite of the fact that under some circumstances they are momentarily discouraged, they keep working together.  \r\n\r\nAcquiring more product will help him increase his income, and that is what he will do with the 1500 PEN that he is now asking for. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":300611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012417,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596006,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990270,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211394,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640902,"comment":null},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":262.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080369,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T04:35:24Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100476,"name":"Yolith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Yolith, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d, vive en el Jr. Elgiba Ram\u00edrez S\/N\u00ba - Caser\u00edo de San Isidro, Distrito de San Jos\u00e9 de Sisa, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

She has seven children, all of whom are financially independent. \r\n\r\nShe started with 300 Soles of her own money, and after reaching an agreement with her husband she opened a grocery store. Yolith's grocery store is located in her home, and her main clients are friends and neighbors. \r\n\r\nWith a loan of 1,000 Soles, Yolith will invest in more products to supply the store. She will buy sacks of rice and sugar, boxes of milk and canned fish, toiletries, packets of soft drinks, and various products to keep her clients happy. She'll repay the loan in four months.\r\n\r\nBoth Yolith and her spouse make decisions regarding income from the business. Personally, Yolith feels more independent, safe, and responsible with her loan repayments. Yolith would like to thank Manuela Ramos for helping her grow as an entrepreneur and a woman. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":298636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy sugar, milk, preserved goods, soft drinks, and toiletries.

Pero estos pedidos tienen sus temporadas durante el a\u00f1o, dejando meses libres de producci\u00f3n, y para seguir trabajando Elsa vende carteras o mochilas en las calles o a sus vecinas pues como madre y padre para sus hijos tiene la responsabilidad de satisfacer las necesidades de sus peque\u00f1os. Su deseo es abrir una tienda en su casa donde pueda vender diversos productos para sus vecinos. Tula viene trabajando con MFP hace 7 a\u00f1os, y est\u00e1 en su treceavo cr\u00e9dito. Junto a sus compa\u00f1eras han logrado tener una linda amistad que es reflejo del buen trabajo que realizan como grupo, pues tratan constantemente de desarrollar algunas actividades que ayuden a fortalecer su banco comunal. El dinero que ahora solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de materiales; como telas e hilos que requiere para sus trabajos.","en":"Tula is 45 years old. She is separated from her husband. Since she had children she learned a variety of tasks to finish building her home, but it isn\u2019t easy to be alone, responsible for the needs of one\u2019s children. As a mother she has had to look for work that wouldn\u2019t impact her work at home and over time she had the opportunity to learn sewing and knitting that they helped her carry out from within her home.  The majority of the orders she receives are for export, at times she works in producing sewn and knitted sweaters in designs valued by foreigners. But these orders have their particular seasons throughout the year, leaving months of production open, and in order to continue working Elsa sells wallets or backpacks in the streets or to her neighbors because as both mother and father to her children she has the responsibility of meeting the needs of her little ones. Her wish is to open a store in her home where she can sell a variety of products to her neighbors. Tula has been working with MFP for 7 years, and this is her 13th loan. Along with her colleagues, they have obtained a wonderful friendship that is a reflection of the good work that they do as a group, as they constantly try to develop activities to help strengthen their communal bank. The money she seeks now will be invested in buying material such as fabric and thread that she needs for her products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":300631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"Materials for her artisan products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-11T02:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":268.84},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":280.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":306.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":319.51},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":332.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85.87,"local_amount":268.84,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":270.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012420,"comment":null},{"amount":89.74,"local_amount":280.94,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":282.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596009,"comment":null},{"amount":93.17,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":293.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990273,"comment":null},{"amount":97.98,"local_amount":306.7,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":308.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211397,"comment":null},{"amount":102.07,"local_amount":319.51,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":321,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640905,"comment":null},{"amount":106.17,"local_amount":332.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":333.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080372,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-11T05:19:00Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100490,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Teresa, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Triunfadoras\u201d, vive en el Jr. San Mart\u00edn N\u00ba 409 del  Distrito de Morales, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

When she started out in business, she was setting out her products on the ground, in the street.  Initially, her earnings were to supplement her family's income but over time, as she gained experience and was left with only this source of income, it became her sole means of meeting the expenses of her family's budget.  With the earnings from her business activity she has been able to buy her stand in the market where she currently works and she is educating her children.  Little by little, she is saving up to pay the expenses for a higher education for her children.  If she were able to obtain sufficient funds, she would use them to expand her sales stand and stock it with a greater variety of merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":300748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Juan de Lurigancho-Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.033333 -77.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-04-11T23:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domingo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mauricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bacilica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2516,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978515,"comment":null},{"amount":1600,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5032,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52949919,"comment":null},{"amount":800,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2516,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63166888,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-16T10:10:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T12:51:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100542,"name":"Osana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Osana T., 38, is married with five children.

old, married, and has four children. He is retired, and lives on the remittances his oldest sons send from Russia. Since Abdugafor lives in a house with a plot of land, he maintains a few domestic livestock. Extra milk is sold to neighbors, and the offspring that he raises are later sold for a profit. Noticing that prices for livestock have fallen a little, Abdugafor decided to obtain a loan and buy one more cow. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":300810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-10T03:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdugafor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":760,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645076,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":760,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084598,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T17:36:10Z","paid_date":"2009-11-14T09:19:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100557,"name":"Fotima","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0424\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0435\u0439 47 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0443\u0436 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043c. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0435 2 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442. \u0418\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0434\u044f\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u0412\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432 \u043e \u041a\u0418\u0412\u0410 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c  \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432.\n","en":"Fotima raises domestic livestock in addition to her regular work.
