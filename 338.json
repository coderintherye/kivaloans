She lives with her husband; they have no children together.\r\n\r\nAlthough she did not finish high school, Ligia has managed to open a profitable sewing business and employs six young women (her nieces). She and her nieces make and sell sports clothing, casual clothing, children\u2019s clothing and pajamas. The women work forty-eight hours a week on average.\r\n\r\nLigia started her business with an initial investment of 75,000 colons fourteen years ago. In a good month, her business can earn 2,000,000 colons; in a bad month only 1,200,000.\r\n\r\nLigia\u2019s main client is a store that contracts Ligia\u2019s business to produce clothing, which is then sold in the store. Her main obstacle in life as well as in business is her health. As a diabetic, she has many migraines and these have prevented her from effectively performing the duties of regular jobs. Ligia has created her own business so she can work in an environment that is flexible to her needs as a diabetic woman.\r\n\r\nLigia hopes she will continue to generate enough income from her business so that she won\u2019t have to look for work elsewhere. Her goal is for her business to grow. She intends to use this loan to seek out new clients and to offer a more diverse range of products such as handmade blouses and vests. Her long term goal is to own a clothing store or boutique in order to sell clothes she has designed herself.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ligia will buy the raw materials necessary for her sewing business such as spools of thread, cloth, and sewing machines. The loan will also be used to hire more women to help her increase the output of her business. In this way she is not only providing work for herself and members of her family, but also for members of the community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":470821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

J. is from the village of Magcamiguing, Calamba Misamis Occidental. She is 34 years old. Annabella is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Annabella owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food products such as repacked \"ginataang langka\" or green jack fruit with coconut milk in the local community. Annabella has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Annabella joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Annabella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Annabella is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Annabella from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

L. is from the village of Magcamiguing, Calamba Misamis Occidental. She is 59 years old. Epripras is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Epripras owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as sugar, salt, noodles, coffee, shampoo, candies, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Epripras has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Epripras joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Epripras has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Epripras is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Epripras from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our field partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":470964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Laura is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell and to purchase feed. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Laura from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 40 years old. She is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMaricel is married and has three school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over twelve years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP every week.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Maricel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital. This loan will be her fifth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/font>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":470154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenneth B. is from the village of San Francisco, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 39 years old. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJenneth is married and has two school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP monthly.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jenneth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase some bags of hog feed to sell. This loan will be her fifth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/font>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":470108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benita L. is from the village of Villa C., Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 52 years old. Benita is the group leader of a fifteen-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nBenita is married and has two adult children. She owns and operates a business selling bananas and vegetables. She has been engaged in her business for over twenty-six years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a week.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Benita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more products to sell. This loan will be her fourth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His wife sells clothing and shoes and, together, they have managed to raise their four children, two of whom are adults and two are still minors.  His goal is to continue to make improvements to his small house which, up to now, he has only been able to do thanks to these loans because the recent hikes in fuel costs in the country have made transportation costs for people much higher.  Therefore, passengers tend to forego taxi rides and opt for the less expensive choice, the bus.  He is making barely enough to cover basic needs like food.  With this loan request he will buy building materials like: stone, sand, cement and iron to build a wall so that his property and his family will be more secure since his current fencing is merely small, old pieces of zinc metal sheeting which he hopes to improve soon and bit by bit close everything off.

Luchie is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Luchie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is 31 years old, is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Margie owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from selling pork barbecue and chicken barbecue in the market. Margie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Margie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 24000 PHP from GDMPC. Margie is requesting a new loan of 24000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the sixth loan Margie has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

L. is from the village of Dimalco Bonifacio, Mis.Occ. She is 39 years-old and married with two school-aged children. Teresita owns and operates a  specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as sugar, snack foods, canned goods, candies, shampoo,  soap and toothpaste in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Teresita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

I. is from the village of Dimalco Bonifacio, Misamiz Occ. She is 44 years-old and married with two children. Veronica owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as soap powder (for laundry), salt, sugar, candy, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Veronica has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Veronica joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Veronica is requesting a first loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

To make a living, Paquita owns and operates a business selling specialty food products from a small food stall\/mini carenderia (restaurant) in the local community. Paquita has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately $136 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Paquita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Paquita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Paquita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 4th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to further improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Nida owns and operates a service-based business, providing motorcycle services to transport passengers in the local community. Nida has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $50 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Nida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Nida is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to further develop her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives with her husband, children and her co-wives in a polygamous family in the Faraba quarter of the town of Bougouni in the Sikasso region of the Republic of Mali. As her parents were poor, she left school and decided to work to earn money, notably by buying and selling clothes, lengths of material and shoes. She learned this trade from one of her female relatives. With 8 years' experience, she is a master of her trade. Mrs. Adiara Samak\u00e9 decided to work with a local group loan association in order to obtain a consistent working capital. After 12 group loans she has progressed to an individual loan. All of the previous loans have been correctly repaid. With this loan she plans to buy pieces of waxed material and other fabrics. She buys her goods in Bamako at the wholesalers and sells them at the Bougouni market and in her local area. Her customers are mainly women. She hopes to earn a monthly profit of 55,000 FCFA. With this she plans on paying the interest due on the loan and growing her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva

He lives with his wife and child at his father's house in the Massablacoura quarter of Bougouni (the third largest region in Mali). As he didn't go to modern school, he began earning money very early, notably through buying and selling beauty and party products etc. He learned this business from a friend and with 17 years' experience, he is good at his job and is very sought after. This is his first time working with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. In order to strengthen his business he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso's loan programme so that he could buy large quantities of highlights, creams, pommades, deodorants and perfumes. He buys his goods in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) from wholesalers and sells them in his boutique located in the main market in Bougouni. He makes the most sales around religious festivals and New Year parties. His customers are mostly women. With this loan he plans on earning a monthly profit of 52,500 FCFA. With this income he plans on extending his boutique, paying the interest on the loan and covering other necessities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva

He lives with his parents in the Ni\u00e9bala quarter of the town of Bougouni (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having been to school, he very quickly started trying to make money, notably working every day with traders in the square. After gaining several years' experience of this, he decided to start buying and selling food items himself. His little shop is located in the large Bougouni market. Whilst looking for extra financial resources, he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso's loan programme. This is his first time with the programme. With this loan he is planning to buy various food items. He buys his produce from wholesalers in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). His customers are members of the local population.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Eight years ago she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available on their land for this business. \r\n\r\nMakhsatoy is engaged in this business together with her husband. Slowly the number of cows increased and with them, her clients started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps, and for this reason she is requesting a loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Homidjon is 53 years old and is married with two children. Since 2004 he has been raising and selling animals. He has his own cattle and, little by little over time, he has been improving and expanding his business with the goal of improving his family\u2019s standard of living and continuing to pay for his children\u2019s education. His wife (pictured) actively helps him with the business.\n\nIMON International has been a fundamental part of Homidjon\u00b4s business, having provided loans which have been used to purchase calves and cows. Today, once again, Homidjon faces this need but he trusts that his loan will be granted to that he can help his business and his family.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Abdukayum is 42 years old. He is married with three children. Abdukayum is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the raising and sale of large livestock at the local market. \r\n\r\nEvery year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Today Abdukayum is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional 4,000 Somoni (TJS) in his business. In order to receive this amount, Abdukayum has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rosaura is a hardworking woman and a fighter, so she decided to set up her own business selling fizzy drinks in the well air-conditioned environment of her own home. She is the one who runs her business, without any timetable or boss. She tells us that she started out with 200 soles and first bought 4 packs of fizzy drinks. As she saw that things were going well, little by little she invested more. Now she continues to run this business and is known amongst her customers who are neighbours, relatives and friends.

She now starts work very early to distribute all of the handicrafts she makes like models, decorations, posters for parties, and surprises, etc.  One of the problems she has in her work is the rains.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy \u201cfomix\u201d (foam crafts), decorations, and paints to have more available material to make handicrafts.  In the future she would like to have a bazaar and teach other people handicrafts for all events.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":470498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Buy \u201cfomix\u201d (foam crafts), decorations, and paints","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-01-18T14:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":79.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":82.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":85.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.4},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.58,"local_amount":79.58,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":79.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910102,"comment":null},{"amount":82.4,"local_amount":82.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":82.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945667,"comment":null},{"amount":83.21,"local_amount":83.21,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674030,"comment":null},{"amount":85.62,"local_amount":85.62,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":85.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708188,"comment":null},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":87.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":87.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891389,"comment":null},{"amount":89.89,"local_amount":89.89,"processed_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":89.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631648,"comment":null},{"amount":91.79,"local_amount":91.79,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":91.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845541,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-18T16:29:41Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169286,"name":"Ismael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr.  Ismael es casado con la se\u00f1ora Lucia tienen un hijo, el cliente naci\u00f3 en Santa Cruz en Vallegrande  el 12 de diciembre en 1985 y aproximadamente 6 a\u00f1os que tienen su propia parcela en la comunidad de Santo Coraz\u00f3n trabajando en la agricultura el solo mantiene los gastos del hogar ya que su esposa es ama de casa, el cliente tiene su propio vehiculo donde su segunda actividad es el servicio de trasporte publico y esto le ayuda tambien en la agricultura ya que con su vehiculo transporta sus productos a los diferentes mercados de la ciudad.\n\nEste cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 utilizado en la compra de semilla, para el cultivo de Soya.

This lady has a small workshop of the name Carmen's Embroidery and a store where she sells her products and handicrafts. She wants to train in sewing since she feels she needs to improve this skill.\r\n\r\nTheir companion,  Patricia Lucia A., has worked for 14 years making clothing, having learned from her grandmother. Since then she has been perfecting her skill. A. wants to continue working, improve her skill, and increase her business.\r\n\r\nWhile the youngest of the group, Marbell T.

The association was founded in 1993 by 20 entreprenurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and organize a tontine.  A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar.  \r\n\r\nAll five of the women of AFDE Group No. 3 work in the main market of Thies.  Ms. Penda N., 42, is the group's president.  She has been a merchant for 22 years. She sells vegetables.  She is married and the mother of four children.  She lives with her family in the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood.\r\nThe other four members all sell fish, which is transported from the fishing towns along the coast.

The association was founded in 1993 by twenty entrepenurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and organize a tontine.  A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar.

small-scale traders working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar.  The association was founded in 1993 by 20 entreprenurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and organize a tontine.  A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar.  \r\n\r\nMs. Bafou S. is the president of Afde group No. 18.  Aged 35, she had worked at home cleaning and taking care of the house, but she decided about 10 years ago to try her hand at business.  Each member of the group recieves 100,000 FCFA for their activity.  Ms. Ndeye Marie D. and Ms. Die Djitt\u00e9 S. both sell fish, Ms Ngoye S. sells jewelry and clothing and Ms. Rokhaya N. sells juices and breakfast.

In the first cycle the 12 members took out a loan of 18,000 bolivianos.  The group's current loan was disbursed on December 22, 2009 to 13 group members. They will repay this loan in 12 bi-weekly installments.  The bank has had a good credit record since the first cycle.  The members are punctual in their attendance at meetings held at the office at 3:00 p.m.\n\nEvelin lives in the Noel Kemf Mercado section, the Plan 3000 Zone, in her father\u2019s house.  She has 2 children from a common-law marriage.  From that house she sells groceries, so as to help support her family.  She has plans for her children to study.  She invested the first loan in her store, making improvements such as the purchase of 3 shelving units.  She used the second loan to buy commodities such as rice, pasta, soap, etc.\n\nRuth is president of the Enterprise Bank.  Her business is selling underwear.  She buys wholesale at the Barrio Lindo bazaar, then goes house to house through the neighborhoods selling on credit.  This is how she spent the loan given her, which was a great help, since her working capital had been used up.  With the help of the institution, she recovered her business.\n\nSonia is a long-time member who sells produce she buys from the El Abasto Market.  She has a place in the little market in May 1st Villa.  She has a common-law husband and two small children.  She helps her family this way.  She used the second loan to increase her working capital, and she now buys in greater quantities.\n\nThey are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for their trust in extending credit.\n \n \n\n<br

Over time, he hopes that his business will grow and will be able to provide a better income.\r\n\r\nThis is Hugo's first loan with MFP; he knows that he must make the payments on time and he is ready to do this.

SDA Primary School, Makeni was founded in 1978 by the SDA Mission to use education as a vehicle for spreading the Adventist message. They train young boys in the morals and ethics of the Adventist Mission.\r\n\r\nSDA Primary School suffered a lot of setbacks over the past years. However, with the intervention of Mr. Benjamin K. as the new headmaster at the school, the school has experienced vast improvements. The new administration under the leadership of Benjamin K. has been able to buy benches for classes five and six through school fees subsidies and development funds. The school has also been able to hire two security guards to keep thieves at bay. And for the first time in the history of the school, it has been able to organize athletics for the pupils. This has added popularity and fame to the school.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan SDA Primary School will be accessing from SMT\/Kiva. (See their journal update through the following link: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=96443.)\r\n\r\nTeachers from this institution, like many other teachers within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nBenjamin M. K. is the head teacher at the school. Thirty-eight-year-old Benjamin (left) is married to a student and they have one child who is still not of school-going age. Benjamin was born in Makeni city. With his share of the loan, he will buy house-building materials \u2013 cement, rods, iron, corrugated tin, etc. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":472373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy house-building materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-01-19T01:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benjamin M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Umu J.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edna F.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul K.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata D.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issa S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marah M.

15 minutes away from the city of Cuenca.  It is a community where people can enjoy its natural beauty.  The inhabitants of this area grow crops and raise animals in order to earn a living.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmelina R. is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cEl Control\u201d and lives in the region of Punta Corral.  She is 45 years old and divorced her first husband after 18 years of marriage because of his irresponsibility.  They had five children who range in age from 20 to 26 years of age.  They all work and help with the household expenses.  Carmelina and her current husband have four children (ages 16, 14, 13, and 10).

The majority of the population works in farming and cattle ranching and most of the young people have moved abroad to provide a better future for their families.

Once arriving in the States, he forgot about his debt and now the house is going to be auctioned off. She currently has her belongings in another location and only her bed remains in the home, taking care of it until it is sold.\r\n\r\nSince being married, Laura has raised chickens and guinea pigs to sell in her community. She also washes clothing and cleans houses, and often does this work three days a week.\r\n\r\nShe was introduced to the foundation by her brother-in-law and began receiving loans six years ago.

They are all from the same neighborhood, El Carmen.  Most of the members have businesses, and others are going to start a new one.  Above all, they have all that is needed to cover a loan with our institution.  Among the activities that the members do is selling bread and selling food; the men work in transportation such as selling groceries, which allows them to make their payments punctually.  The competition among the members is truly very difficult, especially selling food, bread, and groceries.  Each member hopes to get a good sales result each day.  They are very competent because their businesses are well established and well known.\n\nThe businesses of the group members are as follows: Mary (the president) and Jackeline are the only ones who sell cosmetics (one has been in this line of work for 36 years, the other for 48 years): Mary sells Avon products via catalog and Jacky is the Products Director for the Yanbal line of beauty products. Isabel, Dora, Lidia and Esther sell food - one has a grocery store and a year of experience, Luis has been selling computers for the past 36 years, Teresa has been selling utensils for the past 36 years, and her sister Roxana also sells clothing with the same amount of experience. Nelson has been working as a doorman at a school for the past 15 years, and Juanita has been working as a nanny for the past 36 years.\n\nThe loan is to be able to make their businesses a little bigger by increasing their merchandise and raw materials to improve their income.  This way they will be able to get their children and their families ahead.  They want to be able to continue being part of the bank in order to have more economic support in the future.  \n\nMost of the members have experience with communal groups thanks to loans with institutions similar to Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital.  They are very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital for their support and trust.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
