A person has qualities, such as love and care for children, ingrained in his genes.  In our daily lives, we see people, who perform a very heavy labor, work at construction sites, factories, markets, withstanding difficult work conditions and at times putting forth their last effort, all with the goal of earning some sort of income.  People make all of these sacrifices not because of some whim, but exclusively for the sake of their families.  Thankfully, the efforts of the majority of these people do not go to waste.  The heroes of this story are people with average incomes.  But every day, these people put all of their efforts toward the goal of providing for their families and giving their children the most decent living, and this is how they earn public respect.  Aida S. is the leader of this group.  She is thirty-one years old.  She is married and has two children.  Both daughters attend a local school.  Aida and her husband are involved in growing agricultural crops, specifically sainfoin and wheat.  Also, they are involved in watering, weeding and clearing fields of weeds.  Aida hopes to obtain this loan because she now needs to buy 150 liters of diesel fuel and sainfoin seeds.\r\n\r\nAida\u2019s group partners are:\r\n\r\nZamira T. is thirty-five years old.  Her husband is a member of a farm.  Zamira is a mother of three children, however, the children have already grown up a bit, and Zamira helps her husband sell livestock at a market.  Zamira and her husband have a monthly income of twenty thousand som.  She hopes to obtain this loan in order to purchase fuel for wheat sowing.\r\n\r\nNurgul C. is forty-six years old.  Because she lives in a village, growing agricultural crops is the primary type of business there.  Nurgul raised four children and now continues to actively work, showing an example of hard work and effort for her children.  She requested the loan because she needs to buy fuel.\r\n\r\nMairam A. is thirty-six years old.  She is a mother of four children.  Her husband works as a tractor driver.  Because Mairam gave birth to her daughter only a year ago, she stays home with her child.  Currently, Mairam decided to help her husband with the sowing and requested this loan.  She hopes and believes that they will have a good harvest in the autumn.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital for her business. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products for resale. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nenita from GDMPC.

However, not one book, no matter how big it could be and not a movie, no matter how many episodes it could contain, can show all of the nuances of people\u2019s daily lives.  These creations can only show single moments and offer an overall understanding about the lives of our heroes.  The heroes of our story deserve to be heroes of these books or movies because they labor every day for their families and try to provide them with good lives.\r\n\r\nKerimbubu I. is the leader of this group.  Some time ago, she lost her husband.  However, this did not break her and, on the contrary, gave her additional strength because she is a mother of four children.  Now, all of the four children are married and live separately.  Kerimbubu preferred not to be dependent on her children and is currently involved in growing agricultural crops.  She grows wheat and potatoes on her land plot.  In the autumn, she sells the harvest and receives her yearly income.  Kerimbubu has been involved in farming for four years and gained quite a bit of experience.  Originally, she started with five thousand som and now earns up to thirty thousand som per year.  Currently, Kerimbubu needs a loan in order to buy diesel fuel for field work.\r\n\r\nKerimbubu\u2019s group partners are:\r\n\r\nAnarkan Ibaeva is fifty-seven years old.  She and her husband raised seven children.  Her husband is currently retired, but he, Anarkan and their children are involved in growing agricultural products.  Their yearly income is about fifty thousand som.  Anarkan requested this loan in order to buy fuel and wheat seeds.\r\n\r\nGulnara C. is forty-five years old.  Her husband is a tractor driver.  Gulnara is a mother of five daughters.  Currently, Gulnara and her husband are preparing the field for sowing.  They will be planting wheat.  Their last autumn harvest was six thousand ton of wheat.

She lives in an area that is famous for its hand-made clothes and jewelry. She uses the profits from her business to support her family, including paying for her children\u2019s school fees.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of $1,000 USD from Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l.

A 2008 report by the International Finance Corporation notes that women make up about 29 percent of the country\u2019s labor force.

Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loan from Kiva to offer lower interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers.

However, the cruel reality strikes people with severity and ruthlessness and many people face these obstacles without due preparedness and lose themselves.\r\n\r\nYet there are people, who do not take everything in such a fatal way, but seek solutions and use all their imagination and gather all their ideas and energy to come up with sound and practical solutions. The heroes of our story are of this kind.\r\n\r\nI. Zhyldyzkan is the leader of this group. She trades in foodstuffs and other kinds of consumer goods and her spot is located near the school and therefore her trade goes pretty well. She has been doing this job for a year and her monthly income now has reached $180. However, her initial capital amounted to $2,200, and now she is working hard to return her money.\r\n\r\nZhyldyzkan has a caring husband who always helps her buy the goods and transport them. Her husband has his own job: he is a private builder. Now, Zhyldkyzkan is thirty-eight and has a daughter. She hopes to obtain this loan and invest it in her business.\r\n\r\nZhyldyzkan\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nZ. Baktygul, 40, who is a widow. She has three children: two sons and a daughter. To provide for the whole family she is engaged in cattle breeding, doing all the work herself. She hopes to obtain this loan and buy some sheep.\r\n\r\nA. Talant, 38, who has three children. He is occupied with raising cattle and his wife actively helps him to look after them. Now, he needs a loan to buy some sheep.\r\n\r\nB. Shirin, 36, who is a widow. She has two children and she keeps cattle in the shed at her house and trades in them. She has acquired a great deal of experience in this business though it is not quite a woman\u2019s job. She needs a loan as an investment in her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Unfortunately in these cases, there is nobody to guide and give us sincere and correct advice or counseling. From this point, people who make these decisions themselves, relying purely on their intuitions and estimations deserve full admiration and respect. These people do not wait for the right wind, but adjust to the existing one and act accordingly. If taking risks and making tough decisions are needed, they do it, and thus prove for themselves. These types of people make a difference and deserve a different life. \r\n\r\nM. Nazgul is forty eight. She and her husband have been raising four daughters. The eldest daughter has turned twenty and the little one has turned nine. To provide for the family, Nazgul\u2019s husband works as both a cattle breeder and a farmer. Nazgul works together with her husband and helps him farm their land. They have been farming the land for the last sixteen years and have become experienced farmers. During this time they have built a home and now want to give their daughters a college education.

Mairamkul, 34, is engaged in a guest house business. She rents a guest house and leases rooms for tourists. However, her guest houses are traditional yurts - ancient houses of nomads, not ordinary guest houses. Her monthly income is around $330.

As for Ainur, she has been engaged in cattle breeding and increasing the total population of their livestock. Their stable income from raising the livestock for resale, is $90 a month. Ainur\u2019s children have already learned the aspects of this activity and actively provide help when needed after school.\r\n\r\nAinur and her husband are good examples of the category of people who prefer to make the best use of the conditions and opportunities available instead of blaming others for not being able to live properly. Recently they made a decision to make some changes to their house as well. They decided to build a new house and a separate bathroom. This is not an easy task and they need quite a lot of financial support. Therefore Ainur strongly hopes to obtain this loan to start building.\r\n\r\nAinur\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nR. Lira, 51, has three children. Her husband works as a security guard and he also farms land. Lira is a housewife. Besides that, she keeps some cattle at home and thus helps her husband have an extra source of family income. Lira needs a loan to buy fuel, seed potatoes and wheat seeds for the family farm.\r\n\r\nI. Baktygul, 53, has four children and her husband is a private farmer. Baktygul is a language schoolteacher; she teaches both Russian and Kyrgyz. They also own a piece of land and now need a loan to buy fuel for farming.\r\n\r\nZ. Aftandil, 24, is single. He wants to get married and buy a car but he knows that to achieve this, he needs to work hard and earn a sufficient amount of money. He has already started saving money. Now he farms land and needs a loan to buy fuel and seed potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Immaculate has been in this business for 10 years. Besides this bar business, she doesn\u2019t have any other side job. Immaculate works from her home and so doesn\u2019t pay rent though she pays for an operating license. She sells to all categories of people at retail and at wholesale. Her major customers are mainly older men and women. Immaculate works seven days a week. Her business challenges include the rainy season and defaulters. She aspires to build a house to accommodate her bar.  She joined MCDT because she wanted timely loans.  Immaculate resides in and owns a four-room house.  The family has no access to electricity or piped water.

V. was born in the town of Inhambane. Her schooling was interrupted in 5th grade, when, due to her family's financial difficulties, she was sent to live with her older bother in the province of Catembe, Maputo, where he was working at a tourist resort. In Maputo she started going to school again. After finishing middle school, in 1986, she got pregnant and had to start working as a store clerk to support herself and her child. Her earnings from that job allowed her to save some money to open a little grocery store. Since 2000 she has been in the business of selling foodstuff and beverages. Her bestselling products are sugar and rice.\r\n\r\nErmelinda learned about Hluvuku from a friend, and this is her second loan with the institution (the first was in the amount of 16,000). In the past, she's had five loans from another institution in the amounts of 2.000.00, 5.000.00, 10.000.00 and 20.000.00mt respectively. This current loan will allow her to increase and diversify her stock. Since business is doing very well, she's able to save money in the bank. She makes 1.500.00\/day (more on the weekends and at the end of the month) and owns the house she lives in. She hopes to be able to open a daycare one day, and to start a dance group to perform at weddings and other social events.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

C., best known as Uncle M., was born in Maputo, Mozambique, 51 years ago. He had many simblings and lived with his parents in very poor conditions. He only studied until 6th grade and had to drop school to work. \r\nIn 1975 he started working with his uncle, who was a carpenter, as his assistant. That way he learned to make several things from scratch, like furniture, doors and windows. He gained a lot of experience and felt the need to open his own carpentry workshop. He saved up and was able to open his own business. \r\nHe heard of Hluvuku through friends, and has already had 5 loans with the institution, all used to improve his business. He thinks he needs to have a bigger amount of wood on stock in order to be able to build different furniture pieces and expand his clientele. He plans to expose his products in strategic spots where there's high circulation of people, so prospective buyers can see his work, since many people in town are still not familiar with the work he does.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

J. was born in Quelimane 47 years ago. He studied until 5th grade and in his free time helped his parents in house chores, and also helped raised his two younger brothers while his parents were at work. Back then, 5th grade was the highest level of education in Mozambique and Olimpio had to go to Cuba to continue his studies, thanks to a scholarship he received. He studied until 10th grade and from there was drafted into the army and did his training from 1982 to 1985.\r\n\r\nHe came back to Mozambique in 1985 and still works as a Marine in the Marinha de Guerra de Mozambique. He's been working for the army for the past 28 years from 7:30AM to 3:30PM and makes around U$385 per month, which he uses to support his family and save. He's was married in 1992 and had two children, a 16 and a 14 year old. His first wife passed away and he later remarried, and had two more children, a 7 and a 5 year old. All his children are going to school.\r\n\r\nOlimpio heard of Hluvuku from friends and has already taken 5 loans, this one being his 6th. He wants to finish building his house and also build a small business nearby, where he'll sell a little bit of everything, from food products to building supplies. He thinks he has chances to succeed because right now everyone has to go to the neighbor city of Maputo to get basic things, and starting his business will be like a dream coming true.<br

She lives in the house of her parents with her husband Alonso, age 42, and their four beloved children who are the primary motivation behind all of her efforts.  Wilma has been raising cattle for most of her life.  As a young girl, she learned the trade from her parents who tried to give her a good upbringing.  She sells her animals at the livestock fair in the city of Tarma.  Wilma is able to command good prices because her cattle are the largest and strongest of all the animals at the fair due to the excellent care that she provides them.  She has been in this business for 25 years and says the part she enjoys most is feeding the animals.  Wilma hopes to increase the number in her herd so that she can improve her income.

His wife also works as a seamstress, but she previously worked as a police officer and later resigned because the pay was low and not enough to keep up with the expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter saving some money, Armando moved his workshop to the eastern market so that he could establish his business.  The location that was set aside in his home was not totally secure, but with great determination he was able to move forward with his business.

She sells fruit, her business is located in the 16th of July area, specifically in front of the Rosario church just a few steps from the 16th of July Plaza. She brings her fruit from the Yungas zone, which is a dangerous journey because of the topography. She will use the loan as working capital for her business because three weeks ago her car, with which she used to bring merchandise (fruit) to market, broke down. In this accident she lost a large quantity of merchandise, but in spite of this setback she is not giving up and is continuing to work.

This is not the first time he has asked for a loan; this is his third request for a loan.\r\n\r\nThis young, single man plans to use the money to buy fabric, thread, and other accessories to make various articles of clothing to sell.

L\u00e9onie would like to further expand her business so as to cope with the ever-increasing demand of her clientele. This is the reason she is requesting another loan from ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

G. is 32 years old, and lives together with her 3 children of 7, 11 and 15 years old. They live in the small village of San Mart\u00edn, located in the San Salvador department. For 7 years Flor has had her own stand where she sells necessary household goods, such as toilet paper, sanitary towels, shampoo, toothpaste, and comestibles such as instant soups, sardines, sauces, oil among other things. Her stand is located in the Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n market, in the central zone of San Salvador, a location where the majority of people purchase most of their products to then stock smaller shops. The business is in a very good position, and Flor's amiability means she has many customers. She is seeking a loan to purchase a greater quantity of products, mainly to provide her customers with everything they need. In this way Flor hopes to improve her sales and improve her childrens' situation, as she is the only one who looks after their well-being. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane

D. G. is 37 years old, and lives in Apopa, located in the San Salvador department. She lives together with her husband who also works with her in the business. Their 15 year old nephew also lives with them, and her mother in law, who looks after the young boy and helps around the house. Mirna works selling sports shoes for men, women and children, and also sandals and formal shoes for women. Although she has had the business for several years, she doesn't have a large variety of shoes, and for this reason she wants to acquire new styles and a diversity of colours and sizes. This will mean she has greater options to offer her customers. Her business is located in Bolivar Park, in the centre of San Salvador, and all her products are seen by a large number of people who are in transit in the area. She wants to have different styles of sandals and shoes to capture the attention of more people. Mirna hopes to achieve this goal via a loan with Integral, which will help her achieve the aforementioned goal. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva

In particular, everyone loves her gluten-free Brazilian cheese bread (\u201cpao de quijo\u201d), which she learned to make as a high school exchange student in Brazil.  After years of urging from friends and family, Jewelie finally decided to start a business to sell her famous bread.  To build a strong foundation for the new enterprise, Jewelie enrolled in a six-week business planning program at Mercy Corps Northwest in Portland, Oregon.\r\n\r\nAs laid out in the business plan that she developed with the help of her Mercy Corps trainer, Jewelie plans to sell the bread frozen to both wholesale and retail customers. In the meantime, she has been diligently building her network and generating buzz around the product. With a commercial lease, licenses, and a strong network in place, Jewelie now needs funds to purchase equipment (e.g., mixer, freezers, etc.), packaging, and a computer. Because its loan fund was fully deployed, Mercy Corps referred Jewelie to ACCION USA, where she was approved for a $9,000 loan. \r\n\r\nWe at ACCION USA look forward to watching her business grow (not to mention to sample her bread!).\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Information About This Loan\r\nKiva realizes that access to credit is a challenge for entrepreneurs everywhere. Kiva started out as a website focused on developing-world entrepreneurs. In June 2009, Kiva began experimenting with allowing entrepreneurs in the United States to raise money on its website.

He has three children from that relationship.  Two of them are in Lima looking for a better future.  The youngest one lives with him in his own house.\r\n\r\nFor over ten years he has worked as a master builder.  This work is very important to him as his future work depends upon his experience.  His family does not help him with this work.  What pleases him the most about his work is finishing the job without mishap.  \r\n\r\nHe has often experienced some bad moments due to some delay.  This penalized him a lot in his fees.  That is why he makes arrangements regarding the terms of the contract.\r\n\r\nConstruction is his main source of income as it has generated good profits, which have helped him support his children.  He now hopes to team up with one of his daughters.  He will sell clothes with her at a stand inside the market in the city.  In time he also wants to set up a business selling plastics in his house.  He considers this to be very profitable.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.  He is happy to be working with his communal bank.  All of the members are united like a family.  This motivates him to work in an active manner.  He will use the 2,000 PEN he is requesting to buy various bundles of clothes, which will mainly be polo shirts and blouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":541534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy bundles of clothes including polo shirts and blouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-18T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886436,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T18:04:56Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201328,"name":"Marcelino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nMarcelino es un padre de familia de 57 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposa y a sus hijos en el centro poblado menor Lives del distrito de Uni\u00f3n Agua Blanca, un distrito ubicado en la serran\u00eda de la provincia de San Miguel, en la regi\u00f3n Cajamarca, ubicada a cuatro horas y media de la ciudad de Chiclayo, capital de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque.\n\nSe dedica a trabajar desde que era joven brindando servicio de carpinter\u00eda, el suele confeccionar todo tipo de muebles a sus clientes y vecinos de la zona, este negocio le ha permitido salir adelante durante todo este tiempo y gracias a el se ha podido hacer cargo de su familia.

In the photo she can be seen in the first row, first on the left, wearing a black sweatshirt. She sells toys in a lot in the city center; half the month she works everyday, and the other half she works only Saturdays. She will invest this loan in merchandise, the most popular toys such as soccer balls, toy guns, and Barbie dolls. Marjorie's dream is to have her own store space or rented stall, since she currently doesn't have a stand in the lot where she works. \r\n\r\nWhat Marjorie likes about Fondo Esperanza is working in a group.

He has done this work for 8 years on his own land. He does not receive help from anyone, but when it is time to clear the fields, apply fertilizer or harvest his crops, he contracts hired laborers. Farming is quite profitable for him, and he lives comfortably; his work also allows him to save money for projects and unexpected expenses.

S. has another big farmland, on which she plans to plant crops for additional profit. Because S. doesn\u2019t have money, she has applied for a loan to purchase many sacks of fertilizers and crop seeds to grow a better crop. She is hopefully that the loan will provide her with much income for her family and for her loan installment.

The owner of the said land is claiming his rights for personal reasons. Before his demand takes effect, Marianne hopes to have put up a savings fund through her transportation business. The business is managed by her husband and financed by the loan she availed from ASHI. Her membership to ASHI institution started in 2000. Since then she has received several loans, which enabled her to maintain the tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire and to support their family's needs. Marianne\u2019s parents gave the tricycle to her and her husband so that they could have their own source of income. As this tricycle has been used since 2004, its motor engine is no longer efficient. The sidecar is also very old and has to be repainted to be able to look nice and appealing to the passengers.\r\n\r\nMarianne and her husband agreed to request for a larger loan so that they can purchase a brand new motorcycle. The repairs to the old one would cost a huge amount of money. Some of the money will be spent for repairs and repainting of the sidecar. Marianne is hopeful that once they have all these for their business, their income will grow and she will be able to have a savings fund. She hopes to save enough money to build their own house someday on the land owned by her husband's parents. Their old motorcycle will still be operating as a rental to have more profits to support her only child\u2019s education until graduating from college.

Kahambu is an entrepreneur who makes a local beverage known as \u201cRutuku\u201d and is an excellent solidarity group client. A recipient of previous Hekima IMF loans, she is 66, married and the mother of 11 children, seven of whom have their own homes. The four others are students. Mrs. Kahambu lives in the busy neighborhood of Birere-Kahembe, a shantytown in Goma. Her husband is a teacher at the Kajiga\/Karisimbi primary school.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kahambu began her small business using her own funds. She did it on a very small scale, borrowing what was required to make the local drink Rutuku (corn, flour, charcoal, etc.) from her friends and acquaintances, whom she paid after production as she had no capital up front. It was a way of introducing her to taking care of her own needs. In brief, Rutuku is an alcoholic beverage, about 47% proof, brewed from a mixture of fermented cassava flour, corn, sorghum, etc. that is heated to more than 180C (356F) in a vessel connected to a discharge chimney (made using local technology). The droplets resulting from the evaporation process are collected in a bowl and cooled so the result tastes like a liqueur. Given the family expenses, her husband\u2019s bonus or salary from the DRC government is insufficient to make ends meet each month, so Mrs. Kahambu has developed other businesses, including walking around selling women\u2019s clothes and traditional African cloth (pagnes). This helps her meet the household expenses. More specifically, the small profit made from producing Rutuku has enabled her to save enough money to buy a sewing machine and establish a small clothing business. In addition, she works with her son Jacques. They have a public phone kiosk and sell cell phone cards (Vodacom, MTN Supercell, Zain, CCT, etc.). It was after someone told her about the Hekima IMF that she obtained her first loan. \r\n\r\nWith this Hekima IMF loan, Mrs. Kahambu wants to increase her revenues by buying, among other things, two bags of corn, four bags of cassava flour, 12 pieces of African cloth, and 62 public phone cards. Mrs. Kahambu explains that the main challenge of her business of producing the local beverage Rutuku is selling on credit to other small retailers who themselves sell it by the bottle or the glass. Moreover, sometimes when the mixture of ingredients is not properly dissolved, the resulting beverage is not appreciated by consumers and customers are reluctant to buy it. Mrs. Kahambu is very optimistic about the future and wants to diversify her business by also selling Primus beer and Fanta. As she still rents her home, she would like to buy her own parcel of land and build a house on it so she can run a stable business. She also wants to see all her sons married. \r\n\r\nMrs.  Kahambu thanks the Hekima IMF for the loans she has received without any material guarantee because thanks to these loans, she is able to meet the needs of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":541790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"2 bags of corn, 4 bags of cassava flour, 12 pieces of African cloth, 62 public phone cards, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo","town":"Goma, North Kivu province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":160,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Kahambu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":289,"local_amount":289,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":289,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151915734,"comment":null},{"amount":191,"local_amount":191,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-30T09:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":191,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159656116,"comment":null},{"amount":186.64,"local_amount":186.64,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":186.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166870543,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172137031,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177431574,"comment":null},{"amount":83.37,"local_amount":83.37,"processed_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177431575,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-13T22:34:58Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:44:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201442,"name":"Dim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"C. is 31 years old, married, and lives in the province of Kompong Tom in Cambodia.

maternal grandparents in Sanoubougou II, a working-class district in Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 Not having had the chance to advance at school, Ami was introduced to women's hairdressing about eleven years ago.\u00a0 With such experience in this domain, she is in high demand by young ladies, especially for ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, birthdays, etc.)\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe lack of her own funds for running this business has to do with the goal and justification for her loan request at the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.\u00a0 The loan is for doing better in satisfying the needs of her customers, who are ever-increasing.\u00a0 Ami has had an association with Soro Yiriwaso for over two years and is on her second individual loan after having properly repaid her first one.\u00a0 She is requesting this second loan to buy two wedding dresses and ten packets of hair extensions of different qualities, in Bamako (capital of Mali).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAmi envisions using this loan to make an average profit of 100,000 francs CFA, which will enable her to resolve her personal expenses, to help cover family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 Not having had the chance to advance at school due to societal reasons, Madougou was soon introduced to businesses involving commerce in wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth) and embroidered cloth, over thirty years ago.\u00a0 She is much in demand, especially by her customer base (composed essentially of women), for the quality of her products.\u00a0 She receives many orders from the surrounding towns and her business is doing very nicely.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her burgeoning customer base, Madougou decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about seven years ago.\u00a0 After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her district, she is now on her tenth individual loan.\u00a0 All the previous ones were properly repaid.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe plans on using her loan to buy 24 bolts of wax <i>pagnes<\/i> cloth, 18 outfits of embroidered fabrics, and 10 pairs of plastic footwear.\u00a0 She gets her supplies in Bamako (capital of Mali) and then resells them door-to-door in Sikasso and often in the towns surrounding Sikasso.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nMadougou envisions using this loan to make a monthly profit of 180,000 francs CFA, which will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She lives with her husband and children in Mamassoni, an outer district of Sikasso (the third administrative region of Mali). Not having had an opportunity to attend school for social reasons, about ten years ago she quickly launched a small business buying and reselling wax \u201cpagnes\u201d [traditional fabric for wrap clothing], embroidered fabrics, dyed \u201cbazins\u201d [a type of damask cloth highly prized in West Africa], etc. Her business is very popular with her customers (mostly women) due to high quality of her goods.\r\n\r\nIn order to better meet the demands of her growing customer base, five years ago she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. She had benefitted from several \u201csolidarity\u201d loans (group loans) in the past, and is now on her 11th individual loan, which will allow her to purchases 15 sets of wax \u201cpagnes,\u201d six sets of embroidered cloth, and five sets of dyed \u201cbazins\u201d of mid-range quality in Bamako. She has a vendor spot at the local market, where she sells her goods in cash or on credit to a customer base composed essentially of women. She often brings her goods to other areas around Sikasso in order to sell them on local market days. With this loan, she plans to achieve a monthly income of 190,000 West African francs, which will be mainly used to bolster her business capital, contribute to the family budget and pay off the interest on her loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

All members live in the Cuenca area.  For both domestic and foreign tourists, this beautiful Ecuadorian city offers gorgeous natural scenery and the beauty of its historic center, home to historic remains such as the museum and Immaculate Conception Cathedral, one of the largest and most beautiful in America, as well as others dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries.  Its cobblestone streets and houses with facades typical of the republican era give witness to the different European influences, with noble balconies and artistic ceilings.  The city is also known as the \u201cValley of the Andes,\u201d or the \u201cAthens of Ecuador,\u201d because it is the cradle of illustrious men and poets, who have made the city famous.  For this occasion we are joined by Eulogio Rojas, coordinator of the Azuay regional area, along with members of the Women for Progress Communal Bank.\r\n\r\nJennifer G. lives in downtown Cuenca, is 26 years old, married, and has a two-year-old child.  Her husband is a graphics designer in his father-in-law\u2019s printing house, who took this over eight years ago.  They do not have their own home at this time, but share a house with their in-laws, along with its expenses.  Jennifer also works in the printing house, providing professional services in the accounting area, for three years now working from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., with the rest of her time devoted to her child.\r\n\r\nShe has been working with loans from this bank for three years now, thanks to her mother\u2019s invitation to join this lovely group of enterprising women.  The loans have served her for household expenses and for her husband\u2019s printing house.  Her next loan will go to purchase a printing press for the business.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have her own home.\r\n\r\nFlora is 63 years old, and lives with her lawyer husband in her own home, achieved through their own efforts.  They have three children, 35, 32, and 30 years of age, who are married and independent.\r\n\r\nFor eight years, Flora Campo has worked in the bank, being invited by a colleague from the artisans\u2019 union, as she has been a seamstress by trade for fifty years, which she learned from her mother.  She has a small shop in her home, where she fulfills orders, working from Monday to Saturday on a schedule that varies.  With her next loan, she will buy fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, clasps, etc., to supply her workshop.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to see all of her children in their own homes, which will bring comfort to the family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":541494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a printing press, and fabric, thread, zippers, buttons, clasps, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonieta Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Leyi Norka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Blanca Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeniffer Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1980,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":742.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892478,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":495,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632824,"comment":null},{"amount":750,"local_amount":742.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846858,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T13:42:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201515,"name":"Ataa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ataa P. is married and has three children.

She fulfills her orders in the city of Villahermosa.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Trinidad has six children and operates a blacksmith shop with her husband.  The business is located beside their house.  Do\u00f1a Trina, as she is known in the community, will buy more materials such as angle iron, tubing, scrap iron, and metal sheeting so that she can complete orders she receives for doors, window frames, gates, and privacy shields.  She and her husband dream of having a blacksmith shop that is complete so that they can better satisfy the needs of their customers.  They also hope that their children will be able to study for their university degree.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda has two children and manages a grocery store in her home.  Do\u00f1a Luvia and Do\u00f1a Natividad have two daughters each.  Both women sell chickens that they raise at home.  \r\n<p>\r\nAll of these women work extremely hard in their different businesses.  They are a close-knit group and have known each other for many years.  The group would like to thank the Foundation and Kiva for their support and consideration which will allow them to continue their small businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":540347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase blacksmithing materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nacajuca, Tabasco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1481.41},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1491.87},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1502.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1513.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1523.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1534.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1545.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1556.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1567.18},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1578.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1589.39},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1600.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1611.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1623.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1646.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.05},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":358.06,"local_amount":4475.69,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4529.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715840,"comment":null},{"amount":489.31,"local_amount":6116.44,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6190.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899563,"comment":null},{"amount":503.28,"local_amount":6291.02,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6366.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639908,"comment":null},{"amount":649.35,"local_amount":8116.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8214.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854190,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T19:09:50Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201519,"name":"Rabbeca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rabbeca is 24, married, and has been in business for two years.

Petrona has a few personal expenses related to her children and she also wants to restock her store with merchandise that is low in supply.  Therefore, she is requesting a loan to buy baked goods, canned goods, sausages, noodles, rice, and flour.  \r\n<p>\r\nAs of now, all of the members are participating in their eighth loan cycle in the

Even though they are financially independent, her children still live in her house located in the city of Pichanaki.  Her farmland produces all types of natural products that are indigenous to the area.  Roberta has been farming with great care for the past 15 years.  In addition, she manufactures bricks along with her husband.  They both enjoy the work and find it rewarding since it allow them to live comfortably.  What she enjoys most about farming is clearing her land because it allows her crops the best chance to develop properly.  However, transporting her harvest to market is difficult because the loads are heavy and the cost of moving the freight is expensive.  Her entrepreneurial spirit has proven to be an advantage because it has enabled her to continue working.  Roberta now yearns to open a grocery store in her home where she can sell retail and wholesale with hopes of becoming one of the largest distributors in the area.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Roberta is familiar with the work methodology of her Communal Bank and happy to continue her membership because her group is very close and demanding when it comes to completing their payments.  As a result, Roberta has become a responsible person.  With the loan she requested, Roberta will hire workers to rid her farmland of weeds.  She will also buy insecticides to guard against pests that can impact her crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":541988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase insecticides & hire workers to remove weeds from her land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":526.9,"local_amount":1437,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1496.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886440,"comment":null},{"amount":23.1,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":65.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327844,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-21T17:32:22Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201525,"name":"Segundo Baltazar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nSegundo tiene 65 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene tres hijos, vive con su esposa y el ultimo de sus hijos en el sector Carlos Stein del distrito de Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz, un distrito pr\u00f3ximo a la ciudad de Chiclayo considerado el distrito mas poblado de la regi\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n el que presenta mayores indices de pobreza.\n\nSe dedica desde hace mas de un a\u00f1o a la venta de frutas y golosinas en un peque\u00f1o puesto ambulante ubicado frente al terminal terrestre de la ciudad de Chiclayo, el negocio cuenta con muy buena acogida ya que la zona diariamente es frecuentada por bastantes personas que viajan hacia pueblos del interior de la regi\u00f3n.
