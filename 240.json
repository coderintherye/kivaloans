She is 56 years old, separated from her husband, and has four independent children. She is responsible for caring for her three year old neice, which she she says provides her with the strength necessary to move forward. For the last four years she has operated a store from her home and, little by little, and with the help of loans from EDAPROSPO, she has improved both her economic and personal status. She will invest the majority of the loan of S\/ 1,000.00 [approximately US $340] to further supply her store and, with any leftover money, will improve her home.\n\nThe Alcom las Violetas is comprised of 10 members, is in its third cycle, and has until now spent a total amount of S\/ 8,400.00. Each member is dedicated to a different activity such as the sale of CDs, orange juice and candy, among others. They are very punctual and responsible clients that help each other out and do not allow any individual member to fail. They reached out to EDAPROSPO because the organization supports them not only in improving negotiations but also to improve economic and personal issues.\n\nMs Felipa's goal is to have Internet access again, which was shut down due to economic difficulties. \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Chloe Tuot, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":346290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"comas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.95 -77.066667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-07-17T13:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irwin Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz America","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackeline Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crisanto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8400,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":466.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":466.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":933.33,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2823.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592256,"comment":null},{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027467,"comment":null},{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939301,"comment":null},{"amount":466.66,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780143,"comment":null},{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669014,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-07T20:41:46Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":119674,"name":"Neyling","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nNeyling Gutierrez es una dama muy esforzada cuya labor ha sido la venta de productos l\u00e1cteos como lo son quesos de todo tipo, quesillo, cuajada y crema.\n\nElla se ha destacado por ser una excelente trabajadora que ha llevado el sustento a su humilde hogar de habitaci\u00f3n.

It was passed down to her from her parents, and previously by their parents. In her cafeteria, she bakes and sells cakes, pastries, juices etc. She also specializes in baking wedding and birthday cakes.<p>\r\n\r\nThis would be Suzana's fourth loan through Esperanza. With it she plans to purchase ingredients such as flour, butter, and sugar in bulk in order to cut down on her costs, which usually scale up quickly when she buys only small amounts every few days. She hopes to continue to grow her business and improve her living conditions. When her children are old enough to go to college (the eldest in just two years) she hopes the income from her business will be able to pay for their education.<p>\r\n\r\nOne of her long term goals is to continue to push herself in order to provide a better future for her children so they won't have to go through all of the hardships she has gone through."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":346296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase flour,

The president, Mrs. Edid A. S. D. GranD. is very satisfied in working with responsible, united, and collaborative people.\r\nMrs. Edid has a buffet business, where her whole family works. She began studying pastry-making, and since then, she began to make pastries and cakes in her house and then sell them. Her neighbors liked this and began to place orders. This, however, wasn\u2019t enough for her, so she began to grow her business by making food and cocktails for family and neighborhood get-togethers. Now, after 18 years, she has succeeded in having a family-run business; her daughters also work with her when they have many orders.\r\nThose more than 18 years of work satisfy her a great deal, but she worries about the well-being of her friends, so she teaches them what they need to know so that they can also increase their incomes.\r\nThe loan granted to Mrs. Edid will be invested to buy supplies for her buffet and to buy some utensils that she lacks. \r\nShe told us that she wants the other members to not only have a loan, but also to grow as people with values and principles.

S. is from the village of Polo Pitogo. She is 34 years old. Helen is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Helen owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Helen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Helen is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 14th loan taken out by Helen from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

or Lhor to her friends, is 48 and has been in the rice-distribution business for six years. She lives, together with her family, a couple of blocks away from the city's garbage dump area, popularly known as Payatas. Under and around the foot of the gigantic mountain of garbage live Philippines' poorest urban residents, the scavengers. Lorna has four kids, two of whom are in college. Her eldest already graduated from college, all thanks to her rice business. \r\n\r\nLhor owns one of the only three government rice-distribution stores in Payatas. She regularly receives two rice deliveries per week. Each delivery gives her 20 sacks (50 kilos each) of government rice, which she pays for upon delivery. She then repacks the rice and sells it to the community for PHP18.00 per kilo, half the price of other commercial rice. The delivery, repacking and selling all lasts but a day after delivery. The business earns an income of PHP20,000.00 per month.\r\n\r\nLhor considers the business not only as a blessing to her family, but most importantly to her community. More than 300 residents, some of them scavengers from around Payatas, line up every week to get their weekly ration of rice. The line can go as far as 100 meters from the front of Lhor's store. She says she wants to upgrade her order of 40 sacks a week to 70, because more and more families are not able to buy their ration because Lhor's supply runs out every time for them. Dealers like Lorna are chosen by the Social Welfare Department as authorized distributors to poor communities.\r\n\r\nLhor has never missed a savings or loan payment for all her six years of borrowing. Her previous loan was for PHP30,000. She is now borrowing her 13th loan from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT).\r\n\r\nCCT is a Filipino family-oriented and Bible-centered development organization that provides and creates equal business opportunities for small-scale Filipino entrepreneurs through loans and social

Night thanks you for her support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA!\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro credit in Tanzania through micro leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

from Tanzania! This is 45-year-old Sophronia M. from Mwanza. She is single with three children, between the ages of 14 and 22. Sophronia has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 2007. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), and plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Sophronia currently earns about 300 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase rice, cooking oil, and wheat flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Sophronia thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA!<\/b><br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

She intends to pay off the loan in keeping with the payment plan, so in the near future she can request other loans to be used for the same purpose.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

After many years in that business, she mastered the ways of business. Understanding that women love cosmetics, she started this business by selling in the market. After ten years of this activity, she opened a shop in a main thoroughfare which is easy to access. She is very popular and appreciated by the women for her knowledge of the products and advises them about the items they choose; Fanta is wonderfully well-known in S\u00e9gou. \r\n\r\nWith the intent of increasing her business, she is working with Soro Yiriwaso, with whom she has worked for the past 54 months. After 4 group loans and 2 individual loans which were all properly repaid, she is on her third individual loan. She will use this loan to buy 5 boxes of hair extensions, 3 boxes of perfumes and 2 boxes of cosmetics in the Republic of Senegal and will sell them for cash to a mostly female clientele. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn a monthly profit of 45,000 FCFA, which she will use to pay for some family expenses.

This is 27 year old Anitha R. from Mwanza. She is married with one child the age of one year old. Anitha has been running a poultry business since 2007. Her business is a Poultry\/kuku business.  Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients.\r\n<p>\r\nKuku means \"chickens\" in Swahili and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business for 8 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Anitha currently earns about 220 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more chickens. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Anitha thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

They get their supplies in Tonan for the calebasses, and mostly in Bamako (capital of Mali) for the condiments. Calebasses are resold at the Ch\u00e2teau market in S\u00e9gou, at home, and at fairs in Dougabougou, Siribala and Macina. Condiments are resold at the Ch\u00e2teau market in S\u00e9gou, to a clientele comprising mainly women.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women count on turning an average monthly profit of XOF 30'000 (ca US$ 65), to be used to repay the loan and to provide for the family expenses (soap and clothes for the children).

After being interested in several money-earning ventures, she finally  opted two years ago for selling clothing in the \"ch\u00e2teau\" market, as a door-to-door saleswoman, and out of her home. She has a good reputation in this business since the clothing she sells are lengths of cloth from CO.MA.TEX . She has a considerable clientele since these articles are so reasonably priced that many people can afford them. <P>\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy her ever-growing clientele, she came to Soro Yiriwaso with whom she has been working for 30 months. After 3 solidarity loans and 1 individual loan, all correctly reimbursed, she is on her second individual loan. She expects to use this loan to buy 50 lengths of Fancy-brand \"pagne\" (brightly colored African print cloth) right there in S\u00e9gou and she makes her sales, retail, for cash or credit, to a clientele composed of men and women. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 F CFA which will permit her to pay school fees for her children, since her husband is no longer living, and also to pay off her debts. <P>\r\n\r\nHer ambition is to work in import-export between Mali and Burkino Faso. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Cerito Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"To call Carmen R. anything less than an artist would be a misnomer as she is a talented craftsman of jewelry. The bracelets, necklaces and earring sets that she makes are both unique and beautiful. While she has occasionally sold her products in the past, this is the first time that she is trying to truly scale up her efforts. She is moving her sporadically lucrative hobby to a developed business venture.\n\nCarmen R. (far left) is a bright and engaging 50-year-old woman. She is both passionate and a true leader as evidenced by the fact that she is one of the coordinators of group Luz Cerito. Resting at the base of the tropical hills of the Los Alcarrizos barrio (community), La Pared, Carmen lives with her husband and two grown sons.\n\nOne of the main barriers that prevented Carmen from previously scaling up her work was lack of capital. She simply did not have the means to purchase the supplies she needed to make her jewelry. With this loan, she will be able to purchase these materials from a supplier in Santo Domingo, the capital, which is about an hour away from her home. Carmen plans to sell her jewelry from her house and her sister\u2019s salon as she figures women who have just had their hair done will be feeling beautiful and will be more willing to purchase jewelry to complement their new style.\n\nCarmen is excited about the opportunities that this loan will provide. She thinks it is wonderful that her hobby is becoming her profession and looks forward to a life that is more stable, tranquil, and peaceful. On behalf of Carmen Ramirez, the bank Luz Cerito, and the microfinance institute Esperanza International, thank you for providing opportunities to those who need them most.\n\nThis profile was written

He resides with his family in Barangay Research Minante 1 of Cauayan City. \r\nAside from managing his small businesses, Max is also working in the City Hall of Cauayan as a simple staff.  He decided to set up his own business for additional income to support the education of his siblings.  All his sacrifices are for the welfare of his family.  Due to lack of capital, Max would like a loan of PHP 15,000 from the Kiva lenders.  This amount will help him in meeting the demands of his customers who are requesting his products. Aside from selling them in his office, he also delivers some of it to some stores in the village.  He wishes to become successful someday through his businesses.

In lieu of this, she is borrowing a loan of PHP15,000 from Kiva lenders to support her hog raising business financially and to buy enough supply of feed to further grow her livestock.

They live in the rural area of Nabbotuan Solana, Cagayan.\r\n In order to support her hog raising feed supply, Emiliana is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders of PHP7,000. The amount will be of great help to her business. Aside from that, Emiliana sometimes sells vegetables in their village. \r\nHer dream is to make her business grow and she is thankful because Kiva came in the right time at the exact place. She hopes that Kiva loans will become successful in their mission to help the needy people, especially those who are small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":346957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Business

Teresa is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Teresa from HSPFI.

D. is from the village of Purok 8C, Barangay Santiago, Iligan City. She is 29 years old. Julie is married and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, Julie owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Julie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn June 2009, Julie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Julie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business and supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

E. is from the village of Purok 4A, Barangay Santiago, Iligan City. She is 50 years old. Josephine is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn June 2009, Josephine joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell and to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Josephine from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business and to supplement her family's  income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

He lives with this wife and children in the Faraba district of Bougouni City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having gone to school, he got interested at an early age in income-generating work.  For ten years, he used to work daily with merchants, especially in merchandise transport by cart at the marketplace and in the different district of Bougouni, though he was unsuccessful.  So he decided to learn from his uncle how to sell various shop goods.  For four years now, he has been working at this business and is in high demand. \r\n\r\nTo bolster his business, he decided to collaborate with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  He is now on his first individual loan, which he intends to use to buy various goods for his shop.  He stocks up in Bamako (capital of Mali).  His customers are composed of local people. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans to realize a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA that he envisions using to expand his shop.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated

He lives with his wife and children in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord district of the town of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having been able to go to school, he began early to earn his living. For years, Mr. Abou Kon\u00e9 transported baggage with a rickshaw. He was able to save up enough to open a little general store. For two years, Mr. Abou Kon\u00e9 has been selling at the market of Bougouni where he has his shop. He is much sought after and respected in the town of Bougouni.<P>\r\n\r\nIn need of complementary financing, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso with whom he is on his first individual loan. With this loan he intends to buy various items for his shop so as to attract more customers. He buys his merchandise in Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) from wholesalers and makes his sales at the market of Bougouni to a vast and varied clientele. With this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 30,000 F CFA which he hopes to invest exclusively in his shop. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She has five adult children. Before starting this business, she discussed everything with her family and made all the necessary calculations. As a result, for the last fifteen years she has been successfully raising cattle. Even though she has a big family, she has been able to make quite a decent living by this activity, and thus has not been dependent on her children. She mainly purchases young calves and resells them after breeding.  With this loan, she plans to make some home improvements. In the near future, she wants to increase the number of her cattle and buy a new flat in the capital. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Taalaibubu, Zinaikul, and Balbubu. Taalaibubu is a married woman of 51. She has two daughters and two sons. All of her children are adults. Currently, she sells dairy products, and she is able to supply six to seven liters of milk a day for sale.  During the last ten years, she has been able to pay for her two daughters' education and buy a refrigerator, a TV, and a DVD player. Now she needs a loan to repair her house. \r\n\r\nZinaikul, another member, is divorced and the mother of two daughters, both of whom go to school. Following her brother\u2019s advice, she bought a cow and a calf, in addition to two carpets which she bought for the house. For four years she has been raising livestock. Now she wants to use her loan to buy more livestock and gradually increase their number. Then she plans to buy a refrigerator and furniture.  Once this set-up is in place, in the near future, she wants to open her own shop. \r\n\r\nBalbubu is 41, and is the mother of five children. She earns only about 45 dollars per month. Nevertheless, she has great plans of selling strawberries and apples from her own garden and sending her daughter to college. She needs this loan to repaint her house. \r\n\r\nThis group is a great example of striving women who never give up. They believe in a better life, and make real advances towards it.

It is very important to Nimia to make her loan payments on time.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":347125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase candies and used clothing for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-02T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":177.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206087,"comment":null},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":166.34,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635342,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":177.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074412,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":166.99,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":177.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989755,"comment":null},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":166.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":177.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834727,"comment":null},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":177.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726661,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-17T15:29:31Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":119992,"name":"Piotr","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. G. buys goods from the wholesale market in Falesti.

She is prepared to do so.\r\n\r\nThis is Julieth\u2019s fourth loan with MFP.  She expects to be able to make her payments on time, the same as she did with her previous loans.  She is very happy in her Community Bank.  She is always up to date with the agreements made in the group meetings.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 2,000 PEN that she is asking for to fix one of her computers.  Continual usage has caused some problems.  With the rest of the money she will buy plastic chairs for her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":347152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"Computer repair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julieth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211965,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641493,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080932,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997074,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842419,"comment":null},{"amount":113.05,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":344.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842420,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-05T01:38:07Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":120000,"name":"Mma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mma is 48 years old and she is married with four children.

She lives in the house that she inherited from her parents.  She has a great desire to get ahead in life.  Every day she walks the streets of the city of Juliaca, together with her inseparable cosmetics bag, looking for customers who want to buy some of her products.  She is very happy, and she always waits on people with a smile on her lips.  What Maria likes most about her work is advising her customers about which product will give them the best results.  The most difficult is having to walk all day under the cruel sun while she goes door to door visiting her customers.  This makes her very tired.  Mar\u00eda has been doing this for five years.

Her handicraft shop is a very profitable business, since she has several customers who come to her establishment to buy decorations and other items. She starts working very early in the morning and stays in her shop practically all day, since she knows that she has to work very hard to achieve her goals. What Nery likes best about her job is that she can do household tasks at the same time that she is working at her shop. She has been working this way for 12 years and what she likes the least about it is having to stay inside her shop all day without being able to go out into the street. For the future, Nery wants to improve the infrastructure of her shop so that she can provide her customers the service that they deserve.

She lives in her own house with her husband Jos\u00e9 who is 32 years old.  He is always helping her and accompanies her on her everyday activities.  Her store is located in the Tupac Amaru Secondary School where it is frequented by the young people during recess, and they never hesitate to use the money which their parents have given them to buy the delicious baked treats that she sells at her stand.  Lourdes is very charismatic and cheerful and always treats the students with great affection.\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is to entertain herself with the children.  She's been doing this for three years and she thinks that what she likes least is having to remain at her stand all day long without being able to leave.  In the near future Lourdes hopes to have a grocery store which would allow her to increase her income and thus have a better life.

Using the recipes she learned as a child, along with a few of her own, Anita has a corner on the baked goods market in her area. She sells these treats from her house, where she lives with her husband Jos\u00e9 and their five children. Anita loves her job. She began selling baked goodies because she is good at it and because she considers it to be less complicated than other tasks. She states that she doesn\u2019t want the complications of taking people\u2019s clothes to wash, or other services \u2013 she enjoys the simplicity of giving someone a few cookies over the counter in exchange for payment.\r\n\r\nAnita has exciting goals for the future of her family and her business. She has a passion for wanting her business to continue to grow \u2013 and with this being her 6th loan cycle with Esperanza, she has shown commitment to her work. She started out small, and with each loan cycle she has been able to expand her business even more. This has benefitted her family as well. Anita is seeking to build up savings for her children. She will be able to help with any future costs, including university tuition fees. These savings will give Anita the ability to help her family in a greater array of situations that may arise in the future. This is the reason that she is focusing on saving and expanding her business.\r\n\r\nAnita, pictured here far left, is the leader of this group of women named Luz en el Camino (Light on the Road), and her story is emblematic of the other women in her group.  Anita and the rest of Luz en el Camino thank you for your help with this Kiva loan!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":347259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

She works from home, raising livestock and cultivating crops. She breeds guinea pigs, chickens, cows, pigs and sheep, and also harvests corn and beans for her family\u2019s consumption. She is requesting a loan of $165 to buy food and vitamins for her animals, such as grass and grain for her guinea pigs. In the future, she would like to grow her business, but she cannot believe that she still spends lots of money on her children\u2019s education. Some of them are in college now. \"Hopefully they will turn out to be something in life and succeed,\" she said. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Maria Transito is the sister of Mrs. Luz. She is 53 years old, divorced and has 6 children, two of whom live with her.  She has two small businesses that help pay for her children's education: selling wood and cheese she makes from the milk of her own cows. She has faced a few challenges in her life \u2013 including health problems such as arthritis, hearing problems, and vision problems that have made it difficult for her to do much work. She is asking for a loan of $110, which will be used to buy firewood to sell later.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Maria is 42 years old, married and has 3 teenage children. She raises animals such as guinea pigs, chickens, pigs and dairy cows. This woman also grows corn, broad beans and kidney beans in her fields.  She said that she works hard so that her children can study and make something out of their lives. Maria will use her loan of $110 to buy feed for her chickens and pigs. She said that the money will be enough to feed her animals for 15 days.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group is committed to pay the loan on time. The members have been very responsible with previous loans.\r\n<p>\r\nNote: The lady who appears in the photo on the right is Mrs. Rosa C., the treasurer of the community bank group.

M., pictured second from the right and dressed in white, is the group coordinator for her 5-member group called \"Trabajadores Unidos\", which means \"United Workers\". She is the single mother of three children: a daughter of 22, and two boys ages 18, and 10. They reside in Paraiso Escondido, a small town in the sector of Punta de Villa Mella, in Santo Domingo Norte. Her daughter began studying law last year, her oldest son is a sophomore in high school, and her youngest son is a talented baseball player.\r\n\r\nHer home, along with her previous business, a general store in her home, was swept away when a river flooded near her house last year, taking four other houses with it. As a result, her two oldest children had to stop going school to meet their basic needs. She is starting over now by opening up a similar store from her home, selling general care products and basic medicines.\r\n\r\nGregoria plans to invest in such products as hair-smoothing cream, deodorants, shampoos, medicines, and sandals, which she buys in bulk and says are the products in highest demand. The home she is living in now, Gregoria says, is located in a very strategic business location relative to her town. At the end of this loan, she hopes her store will be firmly reestablished, providing her once more with a steady source of income. With this steady income, she hopes to start saving for her daughter's education, and to be able to pay for her sons' schooling and for the baseball coaching and cleats for her youngest son. She also plans to continue working on finishing her current home, as she has placed 800 out of 1,300 cinder blocks for it so far. Since her business is run from her home, having it completed would allow her business to expand.\r\n\r\nSome of her long-term goals are to be able to pay for her daughter's law school education, and also to be able to continue to encourage and support her youngest son, as they hope he makes it to the big leagues.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":347306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

","en":"Yecenia is 40 years old and lives in her own home with her spouse, who is a bricklayer, and their children: Katy - 15, Mal\u00fa - 12, Herbert - 10, and Brayan - 3.  She rents out her car and motor cart in the Comas district of Lima, because this produces good income and is something that she can do from home, since her children, who are school-aged, need her.  Yecenia has always been very hard-working and has done a variety of jobs, but she is aware that her children are of an age now that they need her support.  This is why she decided to start this business, because her husband's wages as a bricklayer is not enough to cover the household's living expenses, while with two people working the expenses are more manageable.  Yecenia enjoys her work a lot, but it is also risky to rent out her vehicles, because they often come back with some kind of damage, which is a problem because repairs are expensive.  For that reason she only rents to trustworthy people.  In the future she would like to buy another car in order to have a fleet, which could bring in good income.  This is her first individual loan and she is very happy to be working with Microfinanzas PRISMA because things have always worked out well.

R. is from the village of Pinig, Dumalinao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale. Lennie has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lennie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lennie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. Lennie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Lennie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She got married a year later and stayed home.  Umeda\u2019s husband worked as a driver at that time and then switched jobs.  Now he does home remodeling and repairs.  Umeda decided to start selling small items.  She wanted to expand her business a bit and borrowed from her mother.  With time, she started selling shoes.  She bought a small stock of warm slippers in the winter and a stock of flip flops and slippers in the spring and summer.  Having found out about financing from her neighbors, Umeda decided to increase her goods turnover.  She talked it over with her husband and liked the lending terms.  After receiving the credit from Kiva, she bought summer shoes.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

By doing this, she hopes that she will be able to generate more income because she is skillful in the business and she has repeat customers who always come to her shop when they need to attend a ceremony or a wedding party.

He has been a tailor for three years after finishing two years of training at a center in the neighborhood of Nyalenda.  He is now working in downtown Kisumu.  With the proceeds from his loan, he would like to buy an overlock machine which he will use in finishing his various types of garments.  He would also like to purchase some more materials including fabric and threads.  <p>\r\n\r\nRight now, Michael earns a salary as he works alongside about 40 other tailors in the large company called Blackberry.  He would like to branch out on his own, and has the confidence that he will be successful.  His dream is to get a small place at the lake market.  Michael currently specializes in men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing and children\u2019s school uniforms.  He makes shirts, pants, skirts and dresses, and also repairs damaged clothing.  Michael is a hard-working man who desires to support his family.<p>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

is a tailor who specializes in uniforms, petticoats, and pants - especially for children.  She runs her business, Beatrice Fashion, in the Kibuye Market of Kisumu, Kenya.  She graduated from her 2-year training course in 1997 and has been working at her trade ever since.  <p>\r\n\r\nAt times, Beatrice experiences cash-flow problems, but knows that she can rely on a steady stream of business from her regular customers.  At times, she has so much business that she has to hire a helper to work on her extra sewing machine.  With the proceeds from her loan, she would like to differentiate her business by purchasing a variety of fabrics from Uganda and Nairobi.  <p>\r\n\r\nBeatrice is a married mother of three boys, aged 11, 8, and 5.  Paying for their school fees and feeding the family is difficult at times, but her income from the business combined with her husband\u2019s income from mechanic\u2019s work helps them to provide for their boys.  <p>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya.
