Reina is a very hardworking woman especially when it is for her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Fanning, Kiva

Both their parents were also farmers and that was their main source of income. Florenda inherited a rice field from her parents; however; she didn't have enough capital to maximize the land for rice production or any agricultural business. In 2008, Florenda decided to join Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) and get a loan to finance her farming business. \r\n\r\nEventually, after Florenda's second loan from ASHI, she was able to accumulate some savings and make their farming business grow. Her 4 children who live with her and her husband have been very supportive. This loan is intended to finance her farming business. It is supported and agreed upon by her family, who promised each other that they would all help Florenda repay her weekly installment to ASHI on time.\r\n\r\nFlorenda's long term goal is to have a rice production business someday so that she can give the opportunity of employment to others, especially to her extended relatives in their barangay (village).

is an old but strong mother who aims to become successful someday by developing her hog raising business.

She hopes to further improve the pig farm in the future through hard work and the continuous assistance of ASHI and Kiva Partner. Because of the lack of business capital, she was encouraged to seek financial support from KIVA lenders.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":587287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","use":"To

N. is 18 years-old and lives in the town of Natete in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is unmarred and has no children. For the last year, Susan has had a hotel (small restaurant) business.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Susan has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase and stock food like rice for use at the hotel.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Susan hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes pay school fees.  In the future, Susan hopes to go back to school. Susan is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by increasing her business.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:\r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, particularly girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Later, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":587281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","use":"To

N. is 21 years-old and lives in the town of Natete in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is married and has two children.  None of her children are currently in school.  For the last three years, Mariam has had a beauty salon business.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more hair dryers.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Mariam hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food.  In the future, Mariam hopes to own a shop of cosmetics. Mariam is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by getting more knowledge on how to live her life through reading story books at the club and learning how to dance and sing. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:\r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, particularly girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Later, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To

M., a 21-year-old resident of the town of Natete in the Kampala West region of Uganda, is single and has two children, both in school.  Elizabeth has a beauty salon that she has operated for nine years.         <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Elizabeth has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to purchase more dryers.  With the help of the loan, she hopes to generate greater profits and pay school fees.  In the future, Elizabeth hopes to own a training school for catering, tailoring and hair dressing. Elizabeth is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future.<p>\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

N. is 19 years old and lives in the town of Natete in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children. Mariam has a business selling vegetables, which she has had for 2 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more vegetables.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Mariam hopes to generate greater profits and buy food.  In the future, Mariam hopes to go back to school. Mariam is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by helping her learn how not to be selfish with others. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Julito E. is from the village of Carmen Annex, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. He is 38 years old and married to Cherilyn E., a simple housewife. They are blessed with 5 children of whom two are now school-aged and three are still little. To make a living, he is presently employed as a security guard in one of the establishments in the city, engaged in retailing snacks, food supplement products, earrings and jewelry, and providing a transport service during nighttime and sometimes early in the morning. He\u2019s been engaged in this kind of livelihood activities for 2 years already and earns approximately Php 5,000 a month from these activities. \r\n\r\n In February 2007, Julito joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. As an active member of Paglaum MPC under the Regular Loan Program Julito has successfully repaid a loan of Php 20,000. He is now requesting a loan of Php 30,000 as his 6th loan which will be used in purchasing a brand new transport vehicle for hire. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family especially in meeting their basic needs, saving for future use, loan repayments and the children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Loy has been running a tailoring business for the past 2 years.          \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Loy has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more materials like cloth for sewing. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Loy hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food. In the future, she hopes to own a tailoring school. She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by helping her to become a good leader and learning how to be confident. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

Mary has a business selling matooke (green plaintain), which she has had for 2 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mary has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more matooke.  With this loan from BRAC, Mary hopes to generate greater profits and to pay school fees. In the future, Mary hopes to own another business like charcoal sales. Mary is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by learning how to deal with customers through financial literacy training. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

N. is 21 years old and lives in the town of Natete in the Kampala West region of Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently not in school. Lydia has a business offering secretarial services such as printing. She has done this for 3 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Lydia has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more paper and ink for printing. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Lydia hopes to generate greater profits and to pay the school fees for her young sisters.  In the future, Lydia hopes to own a house. She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by improving her business and increasing her profile. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Secretarial

This will improve his sales revenue and enable him to maintain a self-sustaining life as he looks at educating his children so that they become important people capable of supporting themselves in the near future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":586173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more food produce for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-26T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonabu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muhame","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Denis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanglista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fausta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jovanis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7100000,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1183333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1183333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1183333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1183333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1183333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1183333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475.83,"local_amount":1072516,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1073006.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903793,"comment":null},{"amount":482.25,"local_amount":1086965,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1087462.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297268,"comment":null},{"amount":521.7,"local_amount":1175901,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1176439.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467542,"comment":null},{"amount":470.28,"local_amount":1060001,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1060486.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605633,"comment":null},{"amount":583.25,"local_amount":1314623,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1315224.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744717,"comment":null},{"amount":616.69,"local_amount":1389994,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1390630.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482893,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-30T20:20:25Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:08:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":224714,"name":"Fidele","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N.

C. is 40 years old. She is single and lives with her children in Chillanes in the Bolivar Province. Petita has 2 children who are 14 and four years old.\r\n\r\nPetita is a member of the rural loan group San Jose del Eden. The group is located about an hour and a half from the town of San Jose del Tambo. The group consists of 20 members, the majority of whom work in agriculture.  \r\n\r\nPetita works in agriculture and raises pigs. She does the buying and selling of her products in the nearby town of Matilde Esther.\r\n\r\nPetita plans to use the loan to grow corn and cacao.

He is also a bursar at a local school.\r\n<br>Elizaphan recently completed his second loan from Kiva partner, Juhudi Kilimo, of 50,000 KES and has requested this loan of 80,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow and connect electricity to his house. With the proceeds from this loan, he will be able to provide for his family and have electricity in his house. He is happy that his children will be able to study comfortably when they have an electricity connection.\r\n<br>Elizaphan's primary challenge has been lack of sufficient capital for expansion. However, he plans to expand his cereal business and be the major supplier to various schools in the locality.\r\n<br>Elizaphan is 44 years old.

She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Kiva partner, Patan Business and Professional Women, and used her most recent loan to purchase grocery goods. In the future, Dhan Kumari plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n<br>In the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, in-coming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About Patan Business and Professional Women<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

She has had her business for over 5 years, starting with some savings she had and making the plan to start a business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying underwear, pants and accessories. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to save to start building her house in the near future. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she like how the loans work, the group, the community and the opportunities. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in the rural area surrounding Hato Mayor, an agricultural area. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":587487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Mila has been engaged in her business for over 26 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mila joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Mila is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to pay for services to increase crop yield. This will be the 8th loan taken out by Mila from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

own. But that\u00b4s how it was, her friend traveled and left her in charge, but she never returned and so Aurora took over. They sell lunch to 12 people who work in a factory and they also have a business in the market selling breakfast. It is going quite well because the workers at the market are their best customers. Thanks to this, she has been able to buy her son a computer and to pay for his studies at a private school.\n\n As for her business, in the future she is planning to rent out a bigger space and install a juice bar. For now she is starting another business selling chicken giblets and she already has a freezer that she bought with her savings. With this loan she will buy the giblets so she can start selling. The group that she belongs to is called \"UNIDAS TRIUNFAERMOS\", there are 10 members and for the first time she is the president and hopes to do a good job.\n\n* Aurora de los Santos is the fourth from the right.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":587505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy supplies for their businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-14T15:57:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora De Los Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yude Segundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Genoveva Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milagros Ursula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Cinthia Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lucia Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9200,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2310,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098169,"comment":null},{"amount":825,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2310,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390838,"comment":null},{"amount":825,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2310,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529118,"comment":null},{"amount":825,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2310,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665226,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T15:36:18Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":224764,"name":"Rosejen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosejen D. is from the village of Manano.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying a seat to use while brushing her clients' hair, chairs and some beauty products. She will also add a telephone service. She will use the profits to buy some items her family needs, like clothes and school supplies, and also plans to save.

She has a 5-year old son and together with her husband, works hard to get ahead. Carmen has some experience tailoring, and it occurred to her last year that the vendors in the biggest commercial centers in Bogot\u00e1, such as El Madrugon, did very well in business.  \r\n\r\nShe bought some sweatpants to try out her first design, and thereafter bought patterns with a group of friends. From there she has gradually expanded to other commercial centers and department stores in Bogot\u00e1, where she has been very successful. \r\n\r\nAlthough Carmen already has her own tailoring workshop her goal is to increase the number of clients she has. Her challenges include setting up additional tailoring workshops and in the future, saving enough to buy her own house. With her Kiva loan, her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Sano Domingo, Carmen will buy supplies such as fabrics, elastic, and adornments to make clothing and continue building her business day by day.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

Her  story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) generally. Her group is located in Los Arcarizos, a dusty industrial area north of the capital where free traD. zones are common. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":587576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to

She has had her business for two years; she started it with some savings and improved it after being invited to a group in her community by a friend. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying clothing and shoes. She will use the profits to get electrical service and to improve her business. She wants in the near future to have a clothing store.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because \"I like the payments plan and interest, also i'm learning how to do business\". Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally, her group is located in Los Arcarrizos, a dusty industrial area north of the capital where free trade zones are common. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

G. represents the Rayito de Luz [Little Ray of Light] group, located in the community of Felipe Neri, Tlalnepantla, in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  The group has five members, who are neighbors.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  The members of the group are: Silvia M. Granada, who will use her loan to buy merchandise including soft drinks, cookies, chips, and candy to stock up her grocery store; Gloria A. C., who  plans to buy a griddle, roofing for her locale, tables and chairs, and vegetables, tomatoes, and green tomatoes to make her Mexican street foods; Silvia G. R., who plans to buy sacks of organic fertilizer to treat her trees so she can grow fruit; Armada G. R., who will purchase loads of corn to make her handmade tortillas; and Felipa Garc\u00eda S., who plans to buy broad beans, pumpkins, peaches, and limes in bulk wholesale to stock up her store.\r\n\r\nSilvia is thirty-years-old.  She completed her third year of secondary school and has her certificate.  She lives in a common-law marriage and has four sons.  Carlos \u00c1ngel, 12, and Jos\u00e9 Ismael, 8 are both in school.  Jorge Eduardo and Luis Eduardo are 3-year-old twins.  She has a grocery store called the \u201cLos \u00c1ngeles Grocery.\u201d  She is seeking a loan to buy chips, cookies, Bimbo-brand bread, soft drinks, water, candy, peanuts, chocolate candies, and gummies to offer her customers.  Most of them are tourists driving by on the highway who stop to rest and buy things at her store, or students and neighbors who come during the rainy and cold seasons looking to buy water and soft drinks.  Her son Carlos \u00c1ngel helps her out in the store.  \r\n\r\nSilvia started her business four years ago, after noting that where she lived beside the highway was a thoroughfare for tourists and seemed like a good place to have a grocery store.  Her husband gave her the money to open and stock the store.  She\u2019s very happy with the loan she\u2019s going to get because it will give her the opportunity to invest in her business.  The business is very important to her because of the financial support it provides.  It brings in extra income, she\u2019s got money for everyday needs, and she wants for nothing at home.  If her sons want something, they can have it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate in Felipe Neri is refreshing.  There are lots of trees and vegetation, and the Chichinautzin Corredor passes through there.  It\u2019s a protected area with heavily-treed forests with deer and panthers in them.  The people plant forage food like oats and corn for the animals.  In December when it\u2019s really cold the water crystallizes into a layer of ice.  \r\n\r\nSilvia\u2019s business has helped her family because she uses what she makes for household expenses or any other expenses that might worry her.  She wants to tell Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cI appreciate the kind of help you give us and I am going to try not to embarrass myself so you\u2019ll keep supporting me with additional loans.\u201d  Her dream is to better herself, stand out, and most of all, grow the business into something better, and add new products.  She will reinvest her earnings and support her sons so they can have a profession.  Her store does face competition; there\u2019s another one next door to hers. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":583714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy chips, cookies, bread, soft drinks, and water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Felipe Neri, estado de Morelos,","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia                                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":314.06,"local_amount":3937.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3992.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854285,"comment":null},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5323.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121184,"comment":null},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415301,"comment":null},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415302,"comment":null},{"amount":104.68,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415303,"comment":null},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415304,"comment":null},{"amount":523.44,"local_amount":6562.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6654.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554939,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-23T09:52:27Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":224816,"name":"Clelia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Clelia tiene 49 a\u00f1os, vive con sus 2 hijos y sus padres en su casa propia.

She lives with her 2 children and her parents in their own house. More than 3 years ago, she decided to generate her own source of income. For this purpose, she has a photocopier located in a small space which she rented in the city center. It is located near several educational institutions, since there is a greater concentration of customers there. In this way, she obtains the necessary income to cover her family's expenses. On some occasions, her children help her with the business. She reports that she enjoys her work, since she does not dedicate much time to it and it is profitable for her, although on some occasions her copier needs mechanical maintenance, so that her business can suffer a setback. For this reason, she wants to have another machine that will work more effectively, allowing her to gain more time for the photocopying service she offers. \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has a source of financial support, since she has always shown herself to be very responsible with her payments.

It is located in Barrio San Pedro, Actopan in the state of Puebla, Mexico. The group is composed of 7 members that know each other and work in pottery creating articles of clay such as cooking pots, jars, flower pots, and decorative clay figures.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are going to use the loan in the following ways. Guadalupe Calixta M. C. is going to buy pots and flower pots to supply her business. Se\u00f1ora Silvina Lilia C. Guzm\u00e1n is going to buy pots and figures in bulk go supply her business. Se\u00f1orita Ver\u00f3nica Arag\u00f3n C. is going to buy casserole dishes, pots, and figures in bulk to supply her business. Se\u00f1ora Aurora G\u00f3mez Dom\u00ednguez is going to buy clay, glaze, and firewood to make various articles. Se\u00f1ora Escol\u00e1stica M. M. is going to buy clay, firewood, glaze, and celite (a type of clay), and paint to make her items. Se\u00f1ora Leonor C. Mar\u00edn is going to buy clay, firewood, glaze, celite, paint, and white earth to make her pots \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Guadalupe Calixta M. C. is the representative of the group. She is 41 years old and has 4 daughters who study and work in pottery with their mother. They are Rosalia, 23, who studies at the university of Puebla; Claudia, 15, who studies in high school; Reyna, 12, who is in secondary school; and Elizabeth, 10, who is in primary school. All of her daughters help her work, creating the clay products. Se\u00f1ora Guadalupe Calixta studied in secondary school and got her certificate.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and she is seeking it to invest in crafts and pottery and plans to buy jars and flower pots to supply her business. She also plans to buy clay and firewood to create casseroles, pots, and jars. She began her business ten years ago. Her parents taught her to work the clay when she was a girl. She noticed that her mother worked and thought 'why not me?' Now she works from necessity for the support of her family, to continue investing, for the studies of her daughters, and the household expenses. The products she offers her clients are casseroles, pots, jars, flower pots, pedestals, large jars, clay figures, and all type of clay products. The clients that come to buy the crafts are from various parts of the country - the State of Mexico, Puebla, Tampico, Veracruz, and Morelos. For her the business is important because it insures the well being of her family. The favorite part of the work in pottery is when she sells and recieves the money. It gives her great satisfaction when she takes the products out of the oven and the very lovely casseroles and pots are quite brilliant. Her earnings are used to continue investing and for the houshold expenses, and the studies of her daughters. Her hopes are to have health to continue working and that the business continues to prosper, and that, god willing, her daughters graduate and achieve their careers.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group wish to say to Kiva and to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Reduce the interest rate so you can continue loaning to us and have confidence in us because if we make the payments and if you lower the rate of interest we promise you to get together more clients.\" In the pottery business we face the problem of the weather which may cause the firewood to get wet and the kiln to cause a batch to fail as the glaze falls and the pots come out green and they have to repeat the process, putting on more glaze so they come out shining.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":586311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy pots and flower pots to supply the business.

She is asking for funds to do so.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for and values the loan granted by this means and pledges to repay in a timely fashion.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":587643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy stock items for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":707.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":735.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":764.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":792.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":274.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":516.96,"local_amount":1442.69,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172071158,"comment":null},{"amount":274.09,"local_amount":764.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":767.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362455,"comment":null},{"amount":283.95,"local_amount":792.41,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":795.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497349,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-02T22:17:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":224826,"name":"Felipa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She\u2019s been married to Yovani for eight years and they have two children named Miguel, age 8, and Jas\u00f3n, age 6.  She sells shoes and clothing through catalogs and tells us that she also sells a bit of costume jewelry that she designs herself.  Her customers know her as being a hard working woman who helps her husband with the household expenses, and as a good saleswoman because she gives them good prices.  Isabel requested this loan so that she could grow her shoe and clothing business.  She will buy items in different colors and sizes so that she will have them on have when her customers request them and not have to order them.  She will also buy stones and silver to design her jewelry.  She would like to use some of her future earnings to establish a permanent location in her home so that she can watch over her children and their education.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 members are Gabriela M.

Although her store is small, it has given her good results as far as income for her household, and with this, she has also supported her children in finishing their education. \r\n\r\nWhat has motivated her to request the loan from the Realidad Foundation is the need to buy more products and expand her business, and to buy higher-quality products, so that her customers will feel confident about the items they buy from her. She comments that she feels very satisfied with this work, since the store is in a good location, and she is popular among customers for the service she provides. \r\n\r\nWith the earnings she obtains from her business, she will invest in buying more merchandise, so that she will not be limited in the amount she can sell, and with this investment she will obtain better profits, so that she can save and do the best she can for her grandchildren, whom she adores and who are her reason for continuing. \r\n\r\nShe comments that her dream is to build a home for each one of her grandchildren, so that when they grow up, they will already have a place to live; however, the most important thing for her is that all of them finish their studies and have significant achievements in life, and for this reason, they will have her support as long as God grants her life.\r\n\r\nThe group is called \"San Miguel,\" and it is made up of four women.

But Akylbek, being a very optimistic and hard-working person, didn\u2019t give up and is doing his best to rise from the ruins.  \r\n\r\nAkylbek is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS to resume his lost business and continue his activities. It will allow him further development of his household and business. Akylbek believes that mutual understanding and friendship always lead to prosperity and well-being. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":587508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Osh","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2010-08-22T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akylbek ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1408.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20127.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182500116,"comment":null},{"amount":433.34,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20127.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201238904,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":30191.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211394154,"comment":null},{"amount":1408.33,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":65415.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226991977,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-31T21:04:59Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:35:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":224858,"name":"Zahida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahida is a resident of Lahore, the second largest city in Pakistan and known for its history and culture. \r\nShe is 35 years old lives in a three-roomed brick house with her family.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":587771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

N. is 19 years old and lives in the town of Bulenga in the Kampala region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. Sharifah has a business of selling vegetables, which she has had for less than one year.  Sharifah also has a business selling charcoal.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sharifah has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more charcoal and vegetables. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Sharifah hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food at home. In the future, Sharifah hopes to own a beauty salon. Sharifah is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by teaching her the skills of getting a job and how to read. \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders: <\/b>BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

She has already received and successfully repaid three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the store inventory.  In the future, Radha plans to capitalize more.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

is 26-year-old Rita C..  She is married and has one child, aged 15 months.  In 2004, she established  her grocery shop business.  Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to increase the inventory of her store. In the future, Rita plans to capitalize more.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores called  'pasal' are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical 'pasal' might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\n This loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\n For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates or join our lending

V. is 22 and married with three children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Danira has 3 years of experience in this business.  Danira needs a loan of WST 1900 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Danira joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Danira's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 26 and married with three children.  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Siuola has 2 years of experience in this business.  Siuola needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Siuola joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Siuola's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 42 and married with 2 children.

P. is 49 and married with 2 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faiupu has many years of experience in this business.  Faiupu needs a loan of WST 1200 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faiupu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faiupu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

is 24-year-old Hasina R..  She is married but has no children.  In 2007, she established  her grocery shop business.  Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the inventory of her store.  In the future, Hasina plans to capitalize more.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a 'pasal', is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical 'pasal' might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Although usually packed into a space no larger than 100 square feet, these stores carry a sizeable and diverse inventory.

is 37-year-old Sunita M..  She is married and has one child, aged 5.  In 2005, she established her grocery store business.  Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase her store inventory.  In the future, Sunita plans to expand the business.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She is married and has one child, aged 6.  In 2003, she established her grocery store business.  Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the store inventory.  In the future, Nitu plans to send her children to a good school.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

O. is 53 years old and married with six children, namely: Janet, age 31; Aileen, 26; Albert, 23; Leonor, 17; Dennis, 19; and Jay Arr, 13. Three of her children are still dependent on the couple and are living with them. Her eldest son is working abroad while the youngest is in secondary school.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a loan of 17,000 PHP to augment the capital needed to expand her business buying and selling meat products. With the help of her husband and children, they will buy live chickens and hogs from farms and communities raising chicken and pigs and then sell the meat products to the city market or deliver to their costumers in the neighboring locality.  They also want to buy a tricycle to use as a means of transportation for buying and delivering their products to market.\r\n\r\nNorma believes that if her loan is granted, it will bring additional income to the family and she will be able to earn and save more for the schooling of her children. It is the popular dream of the couple to provide their children a decent life through them fulfilling an education degree, so that is why she is so dedicated and industrious.  At her age she also wanted to experience dealing with other people and doing business with them. She is happy that ASHI and KIVA are giving her this privilege."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":588228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
