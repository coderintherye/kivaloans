Hing M. is 54 years old, and she lives in Rung village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a 2-hectare parcel of land to grow crops for supporting her family, and on the side she is a Khmer cake maker, who can sell some cakes in the local village door to door. She is a widow with three children, two of whom are employed in the garment factory, while the other is a driver who can get a small salary.

There they are sold against cash - wholesale or retail - on market days, and for the most part to market vendors.\r\n\r\nHe hopes using this loan will bring him to earn 270,000 FCFA per month, which will be used mainly to increase his stock supply, contribute to family expenses, pay off the loan and invest the rest in his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":487568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Buy onions (large and small varieties)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T16:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-19T10:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":125928.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021645,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":125928.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778971,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":125928.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699346,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125928.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180475,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T14:06:16Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175654,"name":"God Knows Us Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary B. is the leader of this group of five borrowers called God Knows Us.

She expects to earn a monthly profit of 250,000 FCFA which will be mainly used to increase her stock of supplies, contribute to family expenses, pay off her loan, and invest the remainder in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":487597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Buy ingredients for her restaurant business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T14:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":71959.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021655,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":71959.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746444,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":71959.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778981,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":71959.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961191,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":71959.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699356,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":71959.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913288,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.58,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":71959.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T19:26:42Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175672,"name":"Blessed Development Group, Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

","en":"The group \"And Liggey\" (or \"Together to Work\") is asking for a loan of 500,000 FCFA for the commercial development of its members. This is a group made up of five micro-entrepreneurial women. It is lead by Mrs. Ndeye Astou D., aged 44 years old. She is the mother of four children. She trades various products like oranges, mangoes, melons, and dried and smoked fish at the market. Influenced by her mother who sold vegetables at the market, she entered the trade in 2000 to better help her family and husband with the family's needs and management. Her part of the loan would allow her to compete with larger suppliers. \r\nThe other members of the group are also active in trade. Mrs. Ndiapaly Ndour N. sells melons and dried fish, Mrs. Malada D. sells Baobab fruit, peanuts, and palm oil, Mrs. Coumba S. sells fruit and peanuts at her home, and Mrs. Mame Diarra N. sells tea, cleaning products, and onions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":487601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Stockage of various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T21:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndeye Astou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndiapaly Ndour ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mame Diarra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036644,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759202,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790717,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971157,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-23T09:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708417,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922486,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-01T12:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188987,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484429,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620672,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-27T11:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50371.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T11:30:12Z","paid_date":"2011-01-27T11:14:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175675,"name":"Rock Of Ages Group, Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"W.

She is Elba Mar\u00eda Bastos, a great entrepreneur that ever since she assumed the responsibility of being a mother, she started selling bottled drinks and ice cream.  With her profits and persistence in saving, she managed to obtain her first refrigerator for the business, and crates of drinks that she would sell first at retail, and progressively at wholesale. With this business, she was able to provide a higher education for her first son, but the extended labor required led her to extreme exhaustion; she decided to change her business to selling fast food, an activity that she does on the weekends and for which she bought a hot dog cart. In her current business, she sells carne asada (grilled steaks), hot dogs, hamburgers, which she combines with other consumables as part of her innovative potential; her food has become a delight in the Costa Hermosa neighborhood, a community of hard working people that appreciate the quality of her products, and the cleanliness of her operation since they know health is a priority for her.  She also sells cosmetics products, taking advantage of the admirable marketing skills that characterize her.\r\n\r\nElba Mar\u00eda has never stopped saving; for a year now, she works with loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; she was recommended by her sister who also benefits from the services of this organization. She currently aspires to get a loan of $2,000,000 (Colombian Pesos) to increase the sales of fast food during carnival season, and to increase cosmetic merchandise sold to order. Her short-term dream is to buy her own establishment, and she also aspires to participate in the housing project Villas de San Pablo; she is going thru the process with help from her advisor Aury Perez and she is planning to apply for government assistance. She attributes the success of her business to discipline and persistence, demonstrated by her, since she has been able to provide for her home, take driving lessons, afford the education of her children, pay for an industrial engineering education, and continue to prepare her children so they can have more opportunities available to them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":484960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Buy consumables to prepare and sell fast food; also buy cosmetic products sold to order.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elba Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120793},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":128219},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130676},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133181},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135734},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":138335},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140987},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":143689},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146443},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":149250},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":152110},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":155026},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":157997},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.36},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.85},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.95},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":120793,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":122926.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949048,"comment":null},{"amount":67.31,"local_amount":128219,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":130483.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677835,"comment":null},{"amount":68.61,"local_amount":130676,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":132983.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712211,"comment":null},{"amount":850.66,"local_amount":1620312,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1648926.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850139,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T18:12:18Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175708,"name":"Angelica Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ang\u00e9lica E. de 27 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona urbana en el Suburbio de Guayaquil, su casa es de ca\u00f1a pero si cuenta con todos los servicios b\u00e1sicos, es madre soltera tiene 2 hijos de 3 y 5 a\u00f1os que estudian en escuelas particulares.\n\nAng\u00e9lica empez\u00f3 con un puesto peque\u00f1o de comida afuera de su casa vendiendo platos como arroz con menestra y pollo asado al pasar de los a\u00f1os tuvo muy buenos ingresos.\n\nAhora Ang\u00e9lica vende platos como pescados al vapor, arroz con pollo, parrilladas de carnes etc. Comienza a vender la comida desde las 18h00 hasta las 22h00 su promedio de clientes es de 30.

Ellos viven en el barrio la manga  lugar donde viven muchos afrodescendientes caracterizados por su car\u00e1cter alegre, trabajador y muy solidario. \n\nInici\u00f3 su negocio elaborando alegr\u00edas, producto de forma circular a base de millo, panela, coco y an\u00eds estrellado, pero por ser un negocio muy estacionario, decidieron dedicarse a la fabricaci\u00f3n de bollos de mazorcas, cocadas y de enyucado (torta a base de yuca que muelen, agregan crema de leche, queso y hornean). Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo por valor de $1.500.000 y utilizara una parte para comprar materias primas e insumos de sus productos, para vender en las fiestas que se avecinan y la otra parte y las utilidades  que se generen en esta \u00e9poca, para organizar un punto de producci\u00f3n y venta, porque en la actualidad el proceso productivo se encuentra dividido entre el patio y la cocina familiar. Ellos est\u00e1n satisfechos pues con su primer cr\u00e9dito lograron comprar un molino pues ten\u00edan que pagar por este proceso en otro barrio ahora lo hacen directamente y se ahorran el arriendo.\nComo Sebastian y su esposa quieren sacar adelante su negocio, tienen como sue\u00f1o principal, poner un punto de venta y para eso   cuentan con un lote de su propiedad que adecuaran para realizar su sue\u00f1o. Mientras tanto Sebastian continua feliz, participando en grupos sociales con su comunidad afrodescendiente, ellos  se ayudan  mutuamente   y comparten,  su m\u00fasica,  sus  ideas y   costumbres tradicionales.\n","en":"Sebasti\u00e1n is 53 years old.  He makes corn fritters with his wife, who is also in the photograph, who helps him with the manufacture and especially the sales.  Once he makes the fritters, he goes out, beginning at 5:00 AM.  He must be out early so that families can enjoy their delicious product for breakfast.  Besides having his own business, he also works part time in a clinic, so his wife provides him with important support.  Together they have 3 children, ages 33, 31, and 8.\r\n\r\nSebasti\u00e1n was born in San Basilio de Palenque, a land which has also witnessed the birth of folk dancers, world class boxers, actors and other important personalities.  It is also a place where \"Champeta\" (a musical genre of independent and local origin from the African descendents) and Tambora (drumming) are part of the culture of the Columbian Caribbean.  They live in the \"la Manga\" (the sleeve) neighborhood, an area where many African decedents live and are known for their cheerful and hard working characters.\r\n\r\nHe started his business by making \" alegr\u00edas,\" a small round treat made with millet, raw sugar, coconut, and crushed anis.  They decided to start making corn fritters, coconut candies, and cassava cakes (made by grinding up yucca and adding cheese and cream and then bake).  This loan of 1,500,000 COP ($750) will be their second loan through \" la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\"  They will use the money to buy ingredients and supplies, so they can sell their products in the upcoming festivals, and to consolidate their production area, which is currently split between their family kitchen and patio.  They are happy because they were able to buy a mill with their first loan. They used to have to pay for grinding to be done in a different neighborhood, but now they are able to do this themselves and are able to save on the cost.\r\n\r\nSince Sebasti\u00e1n and his wife would like to move their business forward, they would someday like to establish a point of sale on a lot located on their property, which they will set up to achieve their dream.  In the mean time, Sebasti\u00e1n continues to be happy participating in social groups within his African decedent community.  They help one-another and share their music, ideas, customs and traditions.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo R., Kiva

She has two daughters, 19 and 13 years old.  They are her biggest motivation.  With love, dedication, and constant work she, by herself, has gotten them ahead with her seamstress business.  \r\n\r\nWhen she started this activity she did it as a pastime.  But, upon separating from her husband, necessity obligated her to make it more than a passtime.  She started looking for a market in the different schools in Cartagena.  Her effort and the quality of her products helped her get contracts with different educational entities, neighbors, and business employees in the city.  She currently sells a diverse line of clothes to them.  They ask for complete outfits, uniforms, blouses, pants, and elegant designs.\r\n\r\nMarisol thanks God for the marvelous gift that she has to do this work.  Her creativity is evident in each design; she adds lots of love.  She started making clothes in 2006.  This work gives her the opportunity of covering her children\u2019s necessities; food, education, clothes, and entertainment.  In addition to covering the family costs, she has been able to buy everything she needs in the house for a better life.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan that she has received from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  With the previous loan she bought raw material and increased her customers.  She accessed new domestic markets and institutions, and she has contracts with them.  Her business has definitely changed her life.  With the business she has work, great personal satisfaction, and she is able to give her children a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a loan for 2,000,000 COP.  She will buy raw material and supplies to make uniforms for everyday and for physical education for the school that she has contracts with and for orders from different customers that she has in the neighborhoods in the city.\r\n\r\nMarisol\u2019s dream is to see her business gradually grow.  Later, she would buy industrial machines and have workers operate them, which would generate income for their families.  She would offer her services to a lot of people who do not know her products and be recognized in the city.  In the long term she would expand into different cities in the country and represent Colombia.  Another one of her goals is to see her children become professionals because she considers that to be the best legacy that she can give them.  She also dreams of having her own house.  The biggest difficulty that she has is facing life alone with her two children.  But, she thanks God that she was able to get ahead.  Now she is happy and fulfilled knowing that she has given them everything they need and taught them that life is not easy.  But, with effort, dedication, and much love they can achieve all of their goals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She communicates well with her customers, which keeps them coming back.\r\n\r\nHelen plans to use her 10,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 34,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more lapa. Her goal is to grow her business and to be healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating micro-finance institution with thirteen branches across the country. Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.

women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":487704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

ranging in age from 5 to 15, all of whom attend school; her oldest child is the 12th grade and the youngest is in the 1st grade. Helena herself is a high school graduate. In addition to her children, Helena also helps care for her mother and grandmother.\r\n\r\nHelena sells foodstuffs such as rice, cooking oil, flour, and onions from a table at the Red Light Market. Red Light is Liberia's largest market and is situated on the outskirts of the capital, Monrovia. She has had this business for about seven years, and started it with working capital of 4,000 Liberian dollars given to her by her parents. She says she maintains a good relationship with her customers and keeps them coming back by \"being nice and friendly and making them laugh.\"\r\n\r\nHelena hopes to be able to grow her business in the future. She will use her 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 26,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more foodstuffs to sell. \"I will buy more goods to put on the table I sell from so that the table will be packed,\" she says. She wants to be able to continue to support her children's education, and hopes they all finish high school and go to college.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country. Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship. LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":487763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy foodstuffs such as flour, rice, and cooking oil for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Paynesville, Montserrado County","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T00:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karlee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jennie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1074},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1918},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1910}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":138.17,"local_amount":9580,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9810.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128985578,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":5755,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5893.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711389,"comment":null},{"amount":64.04,"local_amount":4440,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4546.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144997942,"comment":null},{"amount":89.79,"local_amount":6225,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6374.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755522,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-13T03:24:06Z","paid_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175746,"name":"Nory Edith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nory R.

Life there can be rough with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Maria runs a successful business selling home products to her friends and neighbors. With this loan, Maria will purchase sheet sets to sell for a small profit.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve life for her family. With her profits, she hopes to purchase a small van in order to make her business more mobile. This will add to her profits, which will allow her to improve her home by finishing her bathroom and to purchase a computer for her children. Computers are difficult to afford, but are one of the best investments a low-income household can make. It gives access to the world of information that those of us in the developed world take for granted while teaching children to use the invaluable tools of modern technology. Maria hopes to have her own house one day \u2014 something of value she can pass on to her children.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Thank you for lending to Maria and the Nuevo Renacer group!

Her husband is a bricklayer which has made construction easier since labor is expensive. \r\nMrs. Glinis' has a grocery store which she started seven years ago with money earned by her husband. Earlier she sold tortillas, firewood, and cooked beans. Afterwards, she started her grocery store business which has been a good investment for her as she is able to help when her husband is out of a job. <br>\r\nHer plans are to continue improving their home as she needs to plaster the walls and renovate bathrooms.

Her husband sells lumber and together they work to pay the basic costs of food, in these times when everything is expensive.  When she began, she did it with what little money her husband was able to earn from his sales.  She began by selling cheap vegetables, and now she also sells fruit.  Her future plans are to sell basic grains, and that is why this loan will pay for; rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, fruit and vegetables to increase sales and get ahead.  \r\n\r\nHer plan is to make improvements to her house, which needs plastering, tiling, and bathroom repairs for better sanitation.  She has not yet been able to make these repairs, since everything costs so much, but she hopes by increasing her capital to be able to do so.  With a prior loan she bought a horse, which they now use to go to the bulk market in Managua and buy vegetables, which makes the trip much easier.

communal bank \"Alianza Unida\" was formed in the city of Cuenca, located in the central southern part of the country.  This city is a fusion of 3 rich cultures in its traditional symbolism and art, the Ca\u00f1ari, Inca and Spanish.  The members of this bank are women who are heads of their households, and who struggle to provide for their families.  They are a happy and supportive group; they are always ready to work together so that they all see their families advance economically.\r\n\r\nLuisa F. is 49 years old and lives in a rented house in the suburb of the city of Cuenca with 3 of her 6 children.  The three oldest of her children are already married and live independently.  Her children who are 16 and 13 years old study at a night school so they can work and help their mother at home, since they have no father.\r\n\r\nLuisa has worked as a cook in the restaurant Pio Pio for 15 years, and her schedule rotates from 8am to 4pm, to 3pm to 11pm.  When one of her co-workers does not show up, she has to double her shift.  In addition to this activity she raises chickens, but only to enjoy at home and not for a business.\r\n\r\nLuisa joined the communal bank \"Alianza Unida\" 5 years ago; she was encouraged by a neighbor who is also a member.  The loans have helped her to get ahead with her children, and to have the habit of saving.  The money from the loan she requests will be invested in the education of her children, paying school fees and buying new uniforms.  If there is any money left she will also buy more chickens. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to buy herself some land so that, little by little, she can start building her own home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":487079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay school fees and buy new uniforms for her children, and also to buy chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T00:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910753,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946429,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946430,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674728,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708884,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T05:09:20Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175767,"name":"Enyel Bladimir","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el joven Enyel C. tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la colonia brisas del sur en la ciudad de Nacaome, Enyel se dedica a la venta de zapatos para dama, caballero y ni\u00f1os, ahorita empieza la temporada escolar y desea comprar bastantes zapatos para ni\u00f1os y jovenes que estan empezando la escuela y colegio. \nnecesita comprar zapatos al por mayor, ya que asi se tienen mejores ganancias.\ndice sentirse muy feliz ya que a su corta edad tiene su negocio propio y le todo le esta saliendo muy bien.\nsu meta a corto plazo es poder tener un local y tener su negocio mas establecido y con muchas variedad de zapatos para todos los gustos y tama\u00f1os.","en":"The young Enyel C. is 22 years old and lives in Colonia Brisas del Sur, in the city of Nacaome.

Her sales were going down, so she decided to look for work at Telmark, where they gave her a job as a janitor since they knew her.  This was a great opportunity for her since she now has a fixed salary.  But she keeps making cereal, which her coworkers buy.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will purchase construction materials to build at least a side wall on her house, so she can close the house up little by little and have a little more security, since there is a lot of delinquency in her neighborhood.  So she needs the wall for greater security.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Alcarrizos, Dominican Republic. She is the coordinator for her group, Luz y Progreso (Light and Progress), and her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nElba is a single mother who lives with her three children in L. Alcarrizos, a small suburb of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. Life in urban areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Elba runs a successful beauty salon. With this loan, she plans to purchase a new hair dryer and more hair products for her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Elba\u2019s second loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve her home life for her family. Elba came to Esperanza not just for her loans, but because she likes the ideas and principles behind the work of the MFI. With continued profits, Elba hopes to purchase her own home someday. She also hopes to send her children to the best schools to get a great education. With your loan, she will be well on her way to accomplishing these goals.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

She has a business where she engages in three economic activities:  a sewing workshop, a variety store, and a beauty salon.  Luz is separated from her husband and has custody of her children because their father left the country.  Therefore she must work with great effort in order to get ahead.  She learned how to sew and style hair, skills that enable her to make a living and fight vigorously to support her children.\r\n<p>\r\nSince first entering the solidarity group program, Luz has received eleven loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She now receives individual loans.  Her participation in the organization has made a difference in her life because she has received business and personal advice in addition to taking out loans.  At the moment, she is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 COP to purchase school supplies, stationery, lingerie, accessories for making first communion dresses, linens, and shoes.   \r\n<p>\r\nThroughout the year, she has contracts with schools in the city to rent out first communion dresses since she manufactures all kinds of clothing and sportswear.  Through this activity she gives poor people the opportunity to wear clothing for special occasions at a very low cost.  Luz also sells school supplies and general merchandise, so she is well-known in the community.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer main goals are to acquire a home of her own that is adjacent to her business and provide her children with the college education they deserve.  The main challenge that she faces is maintaining her business in a competitive marketplace.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

a solid, loyal client base, Jenny approached ACCION USA for the capital and know-how she needed to expand her home-based cosmetics business.\r\n\r\nWith her one-year old daughter by her side Jenny enjoys being her own boss. Having weathered the recent financial crisis, Jenny feels she is now in a good position to grow her business. With the knowledge she gained at ACCION USA's educational seminars Jenny plans to continue expanding her business, supporting her family, and increasing her independence. She placed her loan request well in advance of Valentine's Day, so she was ready to capitalize on this big sales opportunity.\r\n\r\nJenny was so happy working with ACCION USA that she often refers other entrepreneurial friends. Originally from Honduras, Jenny feels that she is living proof that you can achieve what you dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":485068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Miami, Florida","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T13:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":84.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":85.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.44},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.14,"local_amount":81.14,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128871925,"comment":null},{"amount":81.68,"local_amount":81.68,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":81.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136602145,"comment":null},{"amount":82.23,"local_amount":82.23,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":82.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144637612,"comment":null},{"amount":82.77,"local_amount":82.77,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":82.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151819557,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T07:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159717023,"comment":null},{"amount":83.88,"local_amount":83.88,"processed_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":83.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166768819,"comment":null},{"amount":84.44,"local_amount":84.44,"processed_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":84.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172037649,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T09:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177328544,"comment":null},{"amount":85.53,"local_amount":85.53,"processed_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182463614,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T05:07:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:33:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175782,"name":"Medardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Medardo and his wife moved their women's clothing import-export business from Mexico City to Miami in 2006, hoping to better serve their increasingly global client base. Their decision paid off since their business has steadily grown; they now have an employee and clients who sell their products locally.\r\n\r\nMedardo and his wife, originally from Honduras, heard about ACCION USA from their daughter. The proceeds of their loan will be used to purchase bathing suits and sportswear and other items from their suppliers' Summer 2010 collection. This investment ensures that they can fill orders fast, better serving their clients and, hopefully, increasing profits.\r\n\r\n \r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

She is the coordinator for her group, La Solucion (The Solution), and her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nAyde and her husband live with their two children in Samana, a small town in the northeastern region of the Dominican Republic. Life in the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Ayde runs a successful mobile clothing business. With this loan, she plans to purchase new shirts and undergarments to sell to her friends and the women in her community.\r\n\r\nThis is Ayde\u2019s second loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve her home life for her family. She hopes to purchase a radio and new dishes for her home, as well as new school supplies for her children. Ayde\u2019s profits also have allowed her to have fun activities with her family, such as ordering pizzas or going out for ice cream. In the past, these types of activities would not have been possible. Her long-term dream is to have enough money to buy a small store where she can run her business, rather than having a mobile business as she does now.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

In addition, they envision a good life for their children by providing them with an education and good health in order to have a better life.  Coming from behind, they have fought to overcome any difficulty in life.  As a result, they have created their own businesses buying and selling clothing; basic products such as sugar and beans; and prepared foods.  They do not have their own shops, but work as traveling merchants instead.

Above all they have a family link.  The bank is located some ten minutes on the outskirts of the city of Cuenca in the Tres Mar\u00edas community of the Tur\u00ed parish.  This area is known as the balcony of Cuenca.  Its people are dedicated to agriculture and stockbreeding.  Many inhabitants have emigrated to the large cities in search of good work and a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nNancy C. is a lady of 37 years and she is one of the happiest associates of the bank.  She lives in her own house in the Tres Mar\u00edas  community on the outskirts of the city of Cuenca along with her husband, a professional bricklayer, and their four children ages 15, 14, 11 and 10.  Her oldest son works as a carpenter for his personal expenses because he does not like to study.  Her son of 11 years is a special boy that requires great care.  \r\n\r\nNancy is dedicated to the sale of salchipapas (a fast food made of fried potatoes and hot dogs or sausage), carbonated drinks, and other delicacies.

This is her eighth loan cycle with the foundation and the loans she has obtained have been invested in the construction of her house.  With the loan that she now requests, she will buy carbonated drinks, potatoes, sausage and sauces to increase her business and to make her dream a reality.  \r\n\r\nMarcia is 27 years old and lives with her husband and their two children that are 8 and 7 years of age.

She saves part of her income and invests another part into her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan through MFP and she promises to make her payments on time, as she has always done, because she does not want to make the people in her communal bank look bad.  She has been working with them for years while trying to get ahead.  She will use the money from this loan to buy three bottles of insecticide in order to fumigate her fields and protect her flower and potato crop from plagues.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":487906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T20:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672924,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T21:13:47Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175832,"name":"Celestino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celestino es un hombre trabajador de 47 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su esposa Dominga, de 38 a\u00f1os, y sus dos hijos: Noem\u00ed de 17 y Raquel de 15 a\u00f1os, en su casa propia.\nEst\u00e1 muy orgulloso de ser agricultor desde hace 20 a\u00f1os, teniendo el apoyo de su esposa, quien es la que le da ideas para progresar.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manayon C. is 47 years old and from the town of San Antonio, San Agustin. She is the group leader of a 15-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\nManayon is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a tailoring business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members. Manayon has been engaged in her business for over 32 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\nManayon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. This loan will be her third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":482459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To

L. is from the village of Brgy Ibung, Villaverde, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 55 years old. Rosalinda is married and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda is starting a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. She plants and harvests fruit and vegetables to sell. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $100 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. That loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

are hardworking, self-confident people. One of the examples is Gulzat A.. She is a well-educated young lady. After graduating from the university, she worked in the bank as a financier for many years. Everything was fine, but since the ambitious mind wants success, as it always does, she was not satisfied with her salary and left the job. \r\n\r\nThen she attended a sewing course. Later on she borrowed 20,000 KGS ($445) and opened up a rented pavilion. Now she sews curtains and makes national crafts. At present, she is thirty-six years old and married. She has a daughter, age sixteen, who attends the local school. Her husband works in a plastics factory in the capital. \r\n\r\nNow her profits per month are about 9,000 KGS ($200). She wants a loan to buy fabrics to expand her assortment, because in March she is going to another city to trade. With the money that she would earn, she wants to buy domestic appliances.\r\n\r\nBubukan C. is a married woman whose husband is a pensioner, but has enough strength to help his wife in her business. In 1997 they began to fatten and sell sheep. With the money earned they married off their son and expanded their number of sheep. They began this business with 2,000 KGS ($45) and now their monthly profit is about 15,000 KGS ($335). With the loan they want to buy nine sheep for 2,000 to 2,500 KGS ($45 to $55) each. \r\n\r\nBakytbek C. is a married man, forty years old. His wife works as a credit manager. He has two children and the elder one attends school. He works in forensics (death investigation) as a dispatcher, and his salary is 6,000 KGS ($134). He is planning to provide education for his children and buy a car as well. With the loan he wants to buy hay.\r\n\r\nRahat A. is a thirty-six year old married woman. She saved some money, approximately 35,000 KGS ($778), with which she bought materials and sewed them using patterns. Her husband does not work now. Her profit per month is about 10,000 KGS ($225). Also she has a daughter who studies at the university and she paid her tuition of about 18,000 KGS ($400). By getting a loan she would expand her assortment of fabrics in order to work in another town.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of a 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Although there is unemployment, the citizens of Balykchy mostly sell fish and goods in the markets, and thus they live. \r\n\r\nHowever, some of them are really hardworking people. One of them is Shayinbubu S., who is a thirty-year-old young lady. She is married and has a son, age five. Her husband is a self-employed taxi driver. Both husband and son help Shayinbubu in her business. Together they sell clothes in the market. With the profit they have bought a car. They thank God that all their troubled days are in the past. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, when it was really hard even to have bread daily, they did not crack. Instead they were determined to find a way out of that situation. About five years ago, for 5,000 KGS ($115), Shayinbubu bought a sewing machine, and little by little she started her business. She was sewing national items and selling them until they got a loan from Mol Bulak Finance. Now she has shifted from making national items to trading clothes. Now she sells women's and men's pants, and she sells apples in the summer. She is planning to buy a big new house and provide education for her son as well. Her monthly profit is about 11,000 KGS ($250). She wants a loan to buy a spring assortment of clothes for both females and males, and to sell the clothes in remote districts on weekends.\r\n\r\nAyzat S. is a twenty-nine-year-old married woman who has two children. Her husband works as the driver of a lorry. His salary is 4,000 KGS ($89). Her elder son is nine and goes to school. Her daughter is five and she attends kindergarten.  Ayzat works at the post office and earns 2,500 KGS ($55). They are planning to buy furniture and educate their children. With the loan they are requesting, they want to buy curtains for their house.\r\n\r\nRakyia B. is a married woman. She is thirty-nine years old and they have four children; two daughters and two sons. The older son attends school, as do their two daughters, but the youngest child is at home. The older daughter helped her mother distribute goods which were bought with saved money (5,000 KGS ($112), and later on the business was expanded and increased among the companies. Her elder daughter graduated from a specialized school. They want a loan to buy a foal and to re-do their house. In the future they are planning to buy a house, a car and give education to their children.\r\n\r\nMednina S. is a young lady who is twenty-four years old and has two children. She is married, and her husband works at a construction company. A year ago, when she started her business with 2,000 KGS ($45), she and her sister were selling half-built houses. Now her revenue is about 4,000 KGS ($90). She wants to buy her own house because she lives with her relatives now. She wants a loan to invest, and with the profits she wants to make her dream come true.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

After successfully graduating from one of the prestigious universities of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyz National University, she worked as an accountant for more years than she could have imagined that she would. She was suddenly let go in 2004. The way she displayed courage was something unimaginable. Because an ambitious mind wants success, she was able to confront that situation. Thanks to God, she had studied well, because she started a little business which soon turned into big one. \r\n\r\nFor 8,000 KGS ($178) she bought a cow. Selling milk didn't contribute enough to the family's budget, so they borrowed money from relatives to buy livestock. They bought bull calves, so that after fattening them they could sell them. Her revenue was about 500 KGS ($12). In the meantime, life went on and now she is fifty-four years old. She has married and has a brilliant husband who works as a teacher. In his free time he helps her with her business. Also she has two children; a daughter and a son. Her daughter is already married and now lives separately, and her son is a student. She is planning to increase the number of calves and provide education for her son as well. She wants a loan to buy bull calves for reselling after fattening. \r\n\r\nGulzada K. is thirty-eight years old and is married. Her husband takes across passengers. They have six children, the elder one studying in the university, the rest attending local schools.  Ten years ago she successfully opened up a business by selling their bull calf for 20,000 KGS ($445). She sells housewares. Her revenue per month is about 15,000 KGS ($334). They already have bought a house, and have built a shop and a shed. She wants a loan to buy more housewares to sell.\r\n\r\nOrozkul H. is a married woman. She is twenty-six years old and has two children who are at home with her. Her husband works on projects sometimes and also resells sheep in the farmyard. Three years ago they started their business with 5,000 KGS ($112) and now their profit per month is about 3,000 KGS ($65). They are planning to get a loan for reselling sheep.\r\n\r\nUlanbek B. is a 22-year-old energetic guy who is planning to build a barn, set up new fencing and increase the number of his livestock. His grandfather started this business ten years ago, but unfortunately he passed and the business was inherited. Now they are dealing with selling milk and cattle raising.  Their total revenue is about 3,000 KGS ($65) and they want to take out a loan to buy a bull calf to keep.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The members live in the city of Phiry, in Ollantaytambo district, in Urubamba province, in the department of Cusco. The area is characterized by its warm climate, its beautiful views, and its agriculture and cattle herding. \n\nFlorentina is a member of the Miskiuno communal bank. She is 58 years old, married, and the mother of five children, two of whom are still dependent on her (Aled y Elvis). Her husband works as a cook. Florentina works in agriculture and raises small animals, such as guinea pigs. She currently has 300 guinea pigs and she sells them to restaurants at a cost of 15.00 to 18.00 PEN per guinea pig. Things are going very well for her because her guinea pigs are known in the area for their quality. She has been selling them for two years. She has also belonged to the Miskiuno communal bank for two years. Her loan will be used to improve the roof where the guinea pigs live and also to buy feed for them. \n\nSome of the other members work in agriculture\u2014for example, Susana, Yolanda, Eloy, Silveria and Pablo. The rest work in a variety of activities, such as tailoring, food sales, crafts, food, vegetables, and animal fodder. \n\nThe members are worried because their sales have gone down due to the heavy rains that fell for three days in the city of Cusco.

For approximately fifteen years, Solange has been living in the Womey neighborhood in the city of Abomey Calavi. She lives there with her family. The couple supports the family expenses together.\r\n\r\nSolange only attended primary school. To provide for herself and her children, she sells liquor (alcohol), and she also sells corn at home.

Nicole Aman was born on April 16, 1963 in Ouidah, a historic village in Benin.  About nineteen years ago, she settled in Gbodj\u00e8 in the town of Abomey Calavi.   Married to SOUSSIA Jonas, a mason, she is the mother of five children who are all in school.  She lives together with her children and husband.  The couple jointly ensures that family expenses are covered.  \r\n\r\nNicole Aman attended primary school only.

lives in Lagos State where she sells loaves of bread and drinks at retail prices to her customers. With over twenty years of experience in sales, she is very willing to expand her business. She loves this business because of the one-on-one interaction that she has with her customers.\r\n\r\nBolale has five children: three males and two females. She is 50 years old and married.

She is married to Mr. TOKPANOU Jacques, an employee at the Port of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  Berthe has six children, of whom some are in school.  All of the children live together with their parents.  \r\n\r\nBerthe helps out her husband where it concerns the different family expenses.  She is a gardener who sells her vegetables at the Ganhi market in Cotonou and who also delivers them to retailers.  Dantokpa, the international market of Benin, is where she buys seeds for planting.   She has been in this business for about twenty years and has already obtained an ALID\u00e9 loan, which she has repaid.

B. is from the village of Libertad, Misamis Oriental. She is 49 years old. Lorna is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Lorna runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community.

Lorna is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Lorna from HSPFI.

For the past 18 years, Albertine Kossiba has lived in the neighborhood of Gbodj\u00e8 in the town of Abomey Calavi, where she lives with her husband and their children.

Albertine Kossiba supplies herself in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin.\r\n\r\nAlbertine Kossiba has been doing this business for 8 years and has already had one loan with Alid\u00e9, a loan which was fully repaid and which enabled her to increase her sales.

Years later, with funds saved from his work, he started raising chickens, starting with a box and a half (1500x100) of chicks and approached Hluvuku to request a loan for 6.000.00 MT to increase the volume of his business. Today he is one of the best chicken farmers in the region and has purchased an average of 100x3 boxes of chicks at a cost of 24.000.00 MT in each phase.

Salom\u00e9 was desperate about the situation because her mother threw her out of the house.  She left Gaza and moved to Vila de Namaacha on the border with Swaziland with a friend to look for work.  After she arrived, she began to work for the governor of the district as a servant, but due to the illness of the century (AIDS) she had to leave her job because she faced discrimination.  \r\n\r\nYears later she began working with plants of various species such as Azaelas, Antores and Cacti) because the reproduce easily and valuable.

She is 42 years old and is a widowed mother of 2 sons, ages 22 and 20.  Her younger son attends school.  In addition to her sons she also supports two grandchildren who live with her.  She is able to save 1.000.00 MT per month. \r\n\r\nHelena left Gaza when her husband was transferred to Vila de Namaacha on the border with Swaziland as part of the Border Patrol.  Years later her husband died, leaving her with two children to raise.  Life was very difficult for Helena.  Then her son-in-law gave her money to start her own business.  She started a business exchanging empty cans acquired in Maputo and reselling them on the border.  In exchange she received lagerins, plastic sandals and baskets, which she resold in the capital and vice versa. \r\n\r\nHer business was growing and she decided to change activities, as that one was very tiring.  In 2000 she was able to set up a booth in the Central Market where she sells basic goods.  Her best products are peanuts, tomatoes, coconut, and cooking oil obtained in Swaziland for the following prices:  a sack for 1.320.00 MT, a box for 500.00 MT, a sack for 500.00 MT and a box for 450.00 MT respectively.  She travels twice a week because in addition to selling in the Central Market she sells in the Informal Market (shoprite) on Thursdays and Saturdays. She makes a profit of 3.000.00MT. \r\n\r\nThis is Helena's third loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva.  The first loan for 7.000 was used to restart her business.  The second for 8.000.00MT was used to purchase more merchandise.  This 13.000.00 MT will be used for the same purpose.  She is confident that she is going to pay back the loan without any problems.  In addition to being a businesswoman she is the secretary of the Bairro 25 de junho neighborhood, for which she receives tips every three months, and she is hoping to build her own sales counter at her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

He is 31 years old and the father of a two year-old boy. After sending 500.00 MT to an aunt whom he helps support, Beloclaide is able to save 1.000.00MT per month.\r\n\r\nWhen Beloclaide was very young, his family moved from Gaza to Namaacha, on the border of Swaziland. He had to interrupt his studies in 10th Grade, when his girlfriend got pregant. In order to help him find a way to support his new family, his father gave him money to start a poultry business. For the last six years, in addition to running his poultry business he's also been working as a security guard, with a monthly salary of 2.600 MT. \r\n\r\nBeloclaide sells an average of 3 boxes of 100 chicks every 15 days, both wholesale and retail so as not to lose his clientele. Spending 21,000 MT in each phase, he earns 8,000 MT in profit when selling wholesale, and 7,000 MT when selling retail to local consumers.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with Hluvuku, and he will use to buy more baby chicks to raise, like he did with the first 8,000.00MT loan. \r\n\r\nHe's had a loan with Banco Novo before, in the amount of 4.000.00MT, which he was able to pay back successfully. He's confident he'll repay his Hluvuku loan before it's due, so he can apply for new ones to build some rental properties, since boarding is always in demand by students and workers who come to Swaziland from other regions.\r\n  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

She has been a member of the U-IMCEC credit union since June 2000. She is a widow and the mother of 9 children. She has repaid her previous 2 loans. She has specialized in braiding women's hair. Since 2004 she has been in business selling artwork, small drums (\"tam-tams\"), long dresses (\"boubous\"), palm oil and hibiscus, which she intends to sell in France.\r\n\r\nShe chose this business in order to earn a living and in order to manage her future, and the future of her children. The aspect of the business which interests her the most is that its lucrative nature enables her to realize enough profits to satisfy her needs.
