And slowly he started to take charge of the family plantations. His brothers and sisters chose different ways to make their living. Now he has extensive stretches of land where he harvests potatoes, pea, corn, and fava beans. He sells his products in the wholesaler's market in the city of Tarma.

The most difficult part of the work has to ward off any insect plagues. In time he hopes to rent the neighboring fields to increase his production. This is the third loan he accesses from MFP (Kiva Field Partner). He has always been timely with his payments and he hopes to retain his record.

Ambrosio is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of cayenne peppers. He works to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land he works is his own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Ambrosio feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events (for example, the Board of Education and the Local Producers Association). The rural zone where Ambrosio lives is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Ambrosio is working hard \u2013 striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Ambrosio and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labour and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Ambrosio. The productive cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Ambrosio planted his peppers 4 months ago and will expect to harvest in the next 8 months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Ambrosio and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity for Ambrosio, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, there is a chance to improve living conditions for Ambrosio as well as the community at large. Above all, Ambrosio wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented \u2013 he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighbourhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":616814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For the purchase of agricultural nutrients and chemicals ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-13T00:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ambrosio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":5.73,"local_amount":2865.3,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2886.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970538,"comment":null},{"amount":394.27,"local_amount":197134.7,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":198593.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158220,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-13T17:24:10Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238050,"name":"Lourdes Suyapa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la se\u00f1ora Lourdes Suyapa B.

A. is from the village of Bato.

The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Wilma has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Wilma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. \r\n\r\nWilma is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP, which will be used to pay for services to increase crop yield. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Wilma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. \r\n\r\nRosalina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":616977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

Slamet really enjoys this business, especially when seeing the buyers are satisfied with the service.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Slamet joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve  his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Slamet is requesting a new loan of 4,500,000 IDR from MUK which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.  This will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from MUK.  Slamet plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of his children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation, and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSlamet H.

Untuk membiayai hidup, Slamet memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pangan.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah membuat & menjual makanan.

Slamet berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk membayar biaya sekolah anak-anak peminjam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking..  \"\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":616996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase additional inventory and as working capital\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-10-13T20:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Slamet","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4500000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":780937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188717130,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":780937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878568,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":390468.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319864,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":390468.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189225,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":390468.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211262847,"comment":null},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":1875000,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1952343.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542791,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-14T04:29:32Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238130,"name":"L\u00ea's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

A. is from the village of Baan, Kayapa, Nueva Vizcaya.

She has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $75 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Estela joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. \r\n\r\nEstela is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

\u0110inh Th\u1ecb (20213030036) is a 37-year-old female living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, T. owns & operates a business selling dried goods in the local community.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT. \u0110inh Th\u1ecb (20213030036) l\u00e0 37 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

T. is from the village of Calamagui. He is 51 years old, married, and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Nestor owns and operates a transportation business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle transport to the local community members. Nestor has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Nestor joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nestor has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase tires and other accessories. Nestor is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to repair his existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Nestor from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay his children's school tuition fees. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

V., age 55, is from the village of Binuangan. She and her husband have four children. To make a living, Nenita makes and sells clothing products to local businesses and community members. Nenita has been engaged in his business for over 35 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nenita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve his living situation and increase his ability to engage in business activities. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Nenita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the town of Plaridel. She is 35 years old. Aida is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Aida owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Aida has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Aida joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Aida is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 15th loan taken out by Aida from PMPC.

She earns a minimum of PHP200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 21, 000 loan.

At this time, she is working hard to continue providing her child and her family enough to finance their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nRosaline operates an accessory business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sells it piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 350 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php21,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nRosaline dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Bunyod is a 29 year old businessman. He is married and, together with his wife, they have 3 kids. Bunyod is a farmer, like his wife. They started their work 5 years ago. The beginning was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With much effort and the help of his wife he was able to move forward and today has a large plot of land. His vegetables are very good quality which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive since the business has a complete underground irrigation system. They sell their products in the fruit and vegetable market of the city. Bunyod requests the loan for the purchase of fertilizer and seeds. This will allow him to better provide for his family.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tajikistan has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Today Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent in a rented yard. \r\n\r\nBatbuyan's oldest son, age 24, attends university.  His eldest daughter, age 21, recently graduated from college and is seeking employment as a teacher.   Two other children, ages 19 and 17, are both college students while his youngest three children, ages 13, 11 and 7, attend school. \r\n\r\nBatbuyan and his wife operate a retail business out of two  rented stalls at a local market. They began their business in 1998 and have built a stable and successful operation.

B. is 25 years old and lives with his wife and one year old daughter in Uvurhangai province, Mongolia. His wife is currently unemployed and stays at home with her infant baby while Bayar-Erdene operates a raw material retail business in his town. He began his business in 2004 with the help of his uncle and after lots of hard work and determination, Bayar-Erdene operates his business independently. Initially, he purchased raw materials using his uncle's money and earned a small profit. In 2007, he has purchased his own van after selling his livestock (approximately 150 animals).

Su unidad de negocio, cuenta con tres trabajadores, de los cuales dos son de planta y est\u00e1  ubicado  en el barrio los Robles, sector cuya nomenclatura es de Barranquilla, pero t\u00e9cnicamente  pertenece al municipio de soledad.\n\n En la actualidad su credikiva es el primero que solicita a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y lo va a dirigir a la  compra de  sus materias primas en mayor volumen como sint\u00e9tico, cuero y accesorios, que adornaran sus finos dise\u00f1os en esta \u00e9poca festiva de fin de a\u00f1o.

Adriana es una mujer so\u00f1adora y delicada que produce naturalmente dise\u00f1os muy exclusivos y de mucha  calidad, pues tiene el prop\u00f3sito de penetrar en el mercado nacional, tal como so\u00f1aron alguna vez sus padres y con ello pondr\u00e1 en marcha el sue\u00f1o de ellos,  que tambi\u00e9n es su propio  sue\u00f1o\n \n\n","en":"Adriana C. B., 30, is an industrial engineer with a microbusiness called Alusso Leather.  Owning her own business has been a dream for Adriana since she was 6 years old.  Although she only set up the business a year or so ago, it has grown steadily.  She wants to position the business in the local market first and then the national market, a goal that she is working hard to achieve.  Adriana has three employees, two of whom are full time.  The business is located in the Robles neighborhood which implies that it is in Barranquilla but, technically, it is a separate municipality. \r\n\r\nThis is Adriana's first loan from Kiva, a loan she hopes to get from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo and that she will use to buy wholesale supplies of synthetic materials, leather and the accessories that dress her beautiful designs. She will use the supplies to make products for the upcoming holiday season.  Adriana plans to position herself in the local market within six months, a real challenge because she faces a lot of competition.  However, her designs are attractive to buyers and she expects her sales to take off over the coming holidays.  \r\n  \r\nAdriana is an entrepreneurial young woman and focused on building her business.  She has always known that she wanted to be an entrepreneur and now she's fulfilling her dream.  She chose to focus on accessories for women because she is a designer at heart and a lover of beautiful things.  She started by making bags and gradually added footwear, taking advantage of the experience of her parents and other members of her family who could show her the way.  She has skill and she believes that will help her make a success of the business quickly.  Adriana is committed to making high-quality products because she ultimately wants to establish a position in the national market.  That's a dream not only for her, but for her parents, as well.\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":617646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Buy supplies for tailoring business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T21:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72993},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":76308},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77771},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79262},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80781},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82329},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83907},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85515},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87154},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90527},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94628}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.97,"local_amount":72993,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":74981.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550789,"comment":null},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":76308,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78386.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688399,"comment":null},{"amount":90.29,"local_amount":157033,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":161310.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427616,"comment":null},{"amount":93.79,"local_amount":163110,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":167552.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157198,"comment":null},{"amount":48.25,"local_amount":83907,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":86192.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509077,"comment":null},{"amount":49.17,"local_amount":85515,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87844.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803025,"comment":null},{"amount":50.11,"local_amount":87154,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89527.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614126,"comment":null},{"amount":51.07,"local_amount":88825,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":91244.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568965,"comment":null},{"amount":52.05,"local_amount":90527,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":92992.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780340,"comment":null},{"amount":54.42,"local_amount":94628,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":97205.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325130,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T01:52:53Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238386,"name":"Araceli","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Maribel is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase young livestock to raise & sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Maribel from ASKI.

San Pablo, Manapla, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her  general store and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7500. \r\n\r\nAna Jane is now borrowing PHP 23000 so that she  could  continue to fund the businesses operations.   This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 23000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ana Jane aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating a beauty salon in the local community. Jimmy has been engaged in his business for over 7 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jimmy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jimmy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service. Jimmy is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand his beauty salon business. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Jimmy from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

V. is a married woman who lives in , Brgy. San Pablo, Manapla, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and a pig raising businesses. Her husband Romulo, who is 68 years old, works as a Laborer to earn his living  and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 7 children who are between 27 to  40 years old. Florita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to purchase dry goods for her general store so that she could continue to save up for future improvements of her business. Florita V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Vaisidin is 42 years old. He is married and has five children. His wife is a housewife and the business of Vaisidin is the main source of income for his large family. \r\n\r\nVaisidin has been providing transportation services for the last 7 years. At the same time he sells construction materials at the market. Vaisidin is dreaming all of his children being well-educated so he is working hard. As a result the business generates significant income allowing him to support his large family. \r\n\r\nIn order to provide the better service for his clients and in that way earn more, Vaisidin needs to make major repairs on his lorry. He believes that this will make his business more profitable. With this purpose in mind, he requests 1500 USD. With part of the loan he will also buy construction materials to increase the range of goods he sells.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

widowed mother of three, Fotima has worked tirelessly for the past 14 years to develop her bakery business. A resident of one of the most impoverished areas of Tajikistan, Fotima has determined to provide the best standard of living possible for her family of five. With the spirit of a true entrepreneur, Fotima opened the only bakery kiosk in the Kumsangir market. As such, she has been successful in maintaining stable growth in this novel business. \r\n\r\nFotima is a woman of character and strength. Her determination and integrity have helped her to develop a strong reputation among clients and fellow entrepreneurs. Currently, Fotima is seeking a loan for 3000 USD to purchase stable shelf ingredients for baking. With the increased profits, Fotima hopes to help her children with the expense of their studies. \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jonna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Jonna is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Jonna from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

D. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture, a general store business. Her husband Gregorio D., who is 55 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have six children who are between 15 and 33 years old. \r\n\r\nVicenta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vicenta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future for student allowance and for family needs. \r\n\r\nVicenta D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is Gliceria G., 59. She is a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Policarpio G. and the mother to five hardworking young adults. By the grace of God, Gliceria has managed to support her children's schooling up to the college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGliceria operates a variety store while overseeing operations of her ready-to-wear clothing store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies in at a wholesale price and selling at a piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nGliceria dreams to be able to have a few more branches of her clothing store sometime soon. She also wants to be able to help her relatives financially. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":617958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T04:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gliceria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":190,"local_amount":7999.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8251.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380505,"comment":null},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5501.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816839,"comment":null},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6666.7,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6876.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652783,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T11:59:56Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238537,"name":"Viviane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Viviane is 36 years old and is married to a house builder.

She is married to Elmer R. Sr., a buy and sell agent and business partner. She is the mother of four children, one of whom is already in high school while the other three are currently enrolled in elementary. By the grace of God, Roselyn has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Roselyn as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRoselyn operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other such products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantity and more variety of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nRoselyn dreams of being able to give all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":617965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more products to expand her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T09:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130,"local_amount":5599.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5645.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380506,"comment":null},{"amount":195,"local_amount":8400.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8468.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816840,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T14:16:50Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238543,"name":"Clemence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clemence is 39 years old and is married to a gatekeeper.
