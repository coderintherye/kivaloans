Arturo, it all began with his move to one of the new districts in Lima, Carabayllo. When he arrived to set up home in the area, few people lived there, and therefore business was at a minimum. Seeing that so many of his neighbours, just like him, had to walk quite a way before finding any shops, he decided to open up his own small shop. Little by little, and with a lot of hard work, Arturo improved his shop and invested in it until he was able to supply groceries, fruit and veg. He confirms that it was very hard to start with, and accessing his house was difficult for suppliers. And so he had to carry goods from the road to his house. But he chose not to give up despite this problem, he felt that the advantages of the business were not only for him but also for the community. Today, in addition to running his store, construction of his drinks area is in progress.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Lucy Williams, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nPara Arturo todo empez\u00f3 con su mudanza a uno de los nuevos distritos de Lima, Carabayllo.

Al ver que tanto sus vecinos como \u00e9l deb\u00edan caminar varias cuadras antes de encontrar una tienda, se animo a poner una peque\u00f1a.\r\n\r\nFue as\u00ed que poco a poco y con mucho esfuerzo Arturo fue mejorando su tienda e invirtiendo en ella hasta abastecerla de abarrotes,  frutas y verduras. El afirma que le fue muy dif\u00edcil al inicio, ya que el acceso a su casa no era muy f\u00e1cil para los proveedores. Entonces el deb\u00eda cargar la mercader\u00eda desde la carretera hasta su casa. Pero \u00e9l no desisti\u00f3 al ver este problema, pues el sent\u00eda que la ganancia no solo era para el sino que tambi\u00e9n para  la comunidad.\r\n\r\nEn la actualidad, adem\u00e1s de manejar su bodega, la construcci\u00f3n de su distribuidora de gas y cerveza est\u00e1 en camino."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":135242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To invest

and a half years ago, Margarita ran the grocery store, with much dedication, which she managed from within her home. The idea to start up this business came from her desire to stand out and help her husband with the family income. At the start, she only sold fizzy drinks and any profit she made she invests back into the business to buy more products. During this time she had a dream to have a shop, but one with a larger selection of goods. Just two years ago, with the help of EDAPROSPO she can see the profits, although she still dreams about a shop. Margarita\u2019s aim is to have a larger sale stand in a market, within a couple of years. But she knows that it will take at least a few years for her dream to become a reality. For the time being, she wants to extend the selection of goods for offer in her store.

They have 2 young children who attend school so the expenses add up. So when TYM started operating in her area, she and her husband had decided to borrow money to invest in a butcher stand. In the beginning, their sales were small. Since they buy their beef directly from supplier they were able to make good profit. Sales had increased and they have been able to save money.

years ago, upon moving to her new house, Diana saw the opportunity to sell, at night, food from a moving stall. For fourteen years, she has sold \u201csalchipapas\u201d (hot dogs and French fries) and she has been gaining customers who happily are not lacking. Initially, the idea to start this small business was to give her children food and education since, even with her husband\u2019s income, they did not always have enough. Now that two of their three children have finished high school, she is thinking of continuing to work with the idea of investing in a bigger business. Nevertheless, the income from the sale of food is the only one she has. Besides this, she and her husband receive money from two mototaxis that they bought two years ago. Her dream is to open a restaurant on the main street of her town. For this, she would like to buy one more mototaxi and make it work well.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nUna vez que se mudo a su nueva vivienda, hace quince a\u00f1os, Diana vio la oportunidad de vender, por las noches, comida en un puesto ambulante.

her 56 years of age, Juana works as if she was half her age. Since almost thirty years ago, she has sold \u201cseconds\u201d (plates, glasses, plastic bags, etc.) At the beginning, she did not have a permanent shop. As a result, she sold itinerantly and would travel to the provinces on a seasonal basis. Nevertheless, she decided that it would be better to acquire a market stall and sell there since it was less tiring than always moving with all her merchandise. She decided to sell seconds because she thought it would be more profitable. Four years ago, her friend abandoned the only stall selling fish and shellfish in the market. So, she thought it would be a good idea to open one herself. Now she runs both businesses, which allows her to take care of her home and her two youngest children. Her husband also sells seconds but in another area and itinerantly. What she would most like is to be able to purchase both stalls -- because she pays rent daily \u2013 and to hire people to work for her.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA sus cincuenta y seis a\u00f1os Juana trabaja como si tuviera la mitad de su edad. Desde hace casi treinta a\u00f1os vende productos descartables (platos, vasos, bolsas de pl\u00e1stico, etc.). Al inicio ella no tenia un puesto estable, motivo por el cual vend\u00eda como ambulante y por temporadas se iba de viaje a provincias. Sin embargo, consider\u00f3 que seria mejor adquirir un puesto en un mercado y vender ah\u00ed ya que era menos trabajoso que estar moviliz\u00e1ndose siempre con toda su mercader\u00eda.   \r\n\r\nDecidi\u00f3 vender productos descartables porque pens\u00f3 que era m\u00e1s rentable.

Her life is very tough because all of her children are still small.  If just depending on some perches of corn land, their family would not have enough to eat.  She cannot work far from home either, because that means she would not have time to take care of her children.  With this situation, Mrs. H. chose to stay home and breed animals.  In order to buy piglets, Mrs. H. borrowed money from TYM Fund (Kiva Partner in Vietnam).  Since she pays the weekly repayments, at the end of each loan term, the amount of loan unpaid is not too much.  Thus, she can  keep most of the money she got from selling the pigs.  Her family income increases significantly with each loan.  All of her children are able to go to school.

Her five children are all grown up.  She now lives with her husband and their youngest child.  For more than 10 years, heir family main income has come from pigs breeding.  After deducting the cost of piglets and food for them, each year she earns some hundreds USD in profit.  This money is rather enough for her to pay for the living expenses.  One of the advantages she has is that her children all have their own jobs, and they sometimes help her with the weekly repayment.  This year, thinking that she is getting old, Mrs. H. intends to buy a cow, raise and later sell it.  This job is easier than breeding pigs.

Working hard all those years to taking care of her 6 children has made her look much older than her real age.  Her youngest child is still in the last year of high school.  With only a small area of rice paddy and a lot of mouth to feed, Mrs. L. spent all her remaining time to cattle-breeding.  She normally has about 6 or 7 pigs in the pen, each weight close to 80 kilograms.  In addition to that, she also raised cow to sell when the price is high.  Each year her family can make all the way up to 1000 USD.  After planning carefully, in this loan cycle, she would like to borrow 575 USD to buy another pair of cows.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Li\u00ean, 50 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean n\u0103m th\u1ee9 4 c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng.

Always making careful decision taking into account her ability and resources, she had always been able to repay her loans on time.  Her monthly earnings has always been around 150 USD.

Everyday he collects palm sap and refines it to sugar to sell in the market and earns around $8 a day of income. They have five children, one of who is married and lives away from the family.

This business is the main source of income for her family and it's important for Mahbuba to develop and expand it. Her merchandise is in high demand among the local residents. Polyethylene is used in farming and agriculture, such as in greenhouses, and that's why the development of the retail sector for this products allows to supply the markets with it.

Jes\u00fas is a small community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project. The bank provides credit and educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations because it's a cold and very mountainous area (with altituD. ranges from 6,000-17,000 feet above sea level), it's difficult to grow crops there, and it lacks an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>BCR Coraz\u00f3n D. Jes\u00fas is located the community of Soccos in the Anco district of Churcampa province. The population's main activities are growing either corn (lower altitudes) or potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes), and raising guinea-pigs, pigs, and chicken. Soccos faces many difficulties due to its remoteness, lack of public transportation, and access to markets, and receives very few public and social services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank has completed its first loan cycle in just half a year of existence. A total of 3,600 soles (about $1,240.00) has been loaned to nine women. The loans range from 100, 200, 400, and 600 soles and, in one case, 1,000 soles. The group was also able to save over 1,700 soles (about $590.00) in this first cycle and will continue to save in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their first cycle, the members have learned to love and value themselves as people. They have learned\u2013sometimes for the first time in their lives\u2013to save, and have received some training about how to improve the quality of their lives. Most members have small grocery stores or sell at local weekly markets, but every member has a different testimony.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dora Z. D. C. runs a small grocery store and also sells ice-cream. With her loan of 600 soles, she will buy new supplies for the store. When asked about her future, she says that she wants to improve her small store and that everything she earns and saves is for the education of her children so they can keep studying and become professionals. She is saving to buy a glass showcase for her products and more items to sell.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mar\u00eda Soledad Q. M. buys and sells fruit at small, local weekly markets. She also has a small field where she produces pacay, oranges, and lime-fruits. And, if it's not enough, she buys and sells tara and cochinilla, which she takes to the markets as well. With her loan of 600 soles she will be able to buy more fruit to sell. With her savings she wants to improve her business, send her children to school, and make improvements to her house.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucia S. S. has the smallest loan of the group (100 soles) and runs a small business buying and selling animals like pigs. Sometimes she sells the meat of cows or bulls in Soccos or one of the local fairs. She also has some terrain where she cultivates corn, potatoes, wheat, barley, and olluco. But most of the production is for auto-consumption. Lucia\u2019s dream for the future is to buy a bull (improved) to use to raise cows. And, like all the women, her dream is for her family--to improve their quality of life and for her children to go to school.

Santa Clara Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>VilL. Santa Clara is a small community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari Project. The bank provides credit and educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations because it's a cold and very mountainous area (with altituD. ranges from 6,000-17,000 feet above sea level), it's difficult to grow crops there, and it lacks an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>BCR VilL. Santa Clara is located the community of Cosme in the Anco district of the Churcampa province. The population mainly grows either corn (in the lower altitudes) or potatoes and wheat (in the higher altitudes) and raises guinea-pigs, pigs and chicken. But the size of the community and its (limited) access to public transport, has brought mO. commerce to the village. There are several restaurants, grocery stores, and kiosks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank has completed its first loan cycle in just half a year of existence. A total of 11,700 soles (about $4,000.00) has been loaned to 24 women. The loans range from 100, 200, 400, and 600 soles, and, in three cases, 1,000 soles. The group was able to save over 2,400 soles (about $830.00) in their first cycle and will continue to save in the future. For all the members, the main use of the savings is to invest in their businesses or for the education of their children: to buy school uniforms, supplies, books and even to pay for them to enter primary or secondary school.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their first loan cycle, the members have learned many things: to work under a mutual agreement, to be responsible, to save, and to receive training in a variety of issues. Another thing they like is practicing values like punctuality, responsibility, and solidarity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosario Severina Q. L. runs a grocery stO. and a restaurant where she gives pension to teachers. To earn a little mO. money, she sells chicken and trout in her restaurant during community festivities when a lot of people come from different communities nearby. With her loan of 1,000 soles, she will buy new supplies for her stO. and the restaurant. When asked about her future, she says that she is saving for the education of her children so they can keep studying and become professionals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucia G\u00f3mez D. sells meals in her small kiosk and the main street. With her husband, she runs another business taking passengers to a nearby community in their moto-taxi.  With her loan of 1,000 soles, she will buy mO. supplies for her kiosk. Her dream for the future is to buy a small terrain near the central square on which to build a house. Currently her house is far away and does not work well for running a business. With her savings she wants to improve her business, selling soft-drinks, and send her children to school.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clara TeofiL. V. P., who has a loan of 600 soles, has a small grocery stO. and some terrain where she cultivates corn. Her dream for the future is the progress of her children and her family. With her savings she will invest in two things: improving her business and paying for her son's education.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":136220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy new supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario Severina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elena Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina Ermetila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belanova Gavy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariel Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Marciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Clara Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Severina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pompeya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Noemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-27T02:28:07Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11700,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2008-04-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1951.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193298,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":675,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2008-05-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1951.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221117,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":675,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2008-06-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1951.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250314,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":675,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2008-07-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1951.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278897,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":675,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1951.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308430,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":675,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-08T07:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1951.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339557,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-03-13T02:28:07Z","paid_date":"2008-10-08T07:11:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":39309,"name":"Imakulata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imakula is 48 years old and is a married woman with 3 children, ages 25, 17 and 12 years old.

She started this business because her husband\u2019s income as a farmer was insufficient to meet their household needs, particularly now that both their kids were in school. With an initial capital of $100, Ni Nyoman Noriani built her business. She sources her materials from a local market. Since she has been doing this for a while, she has a particular store where she buys her inventory. With a small capital, she obviously yields a small profit, which is just enough to provide food for her family. Ni Nyoman Noriani requested a loan through DINARI Foundation to increase her capital. With this loan, she can buy Kamen and worship means in bigger quantities and wider selections so that her customers will have more items to choose from. She hopes that this business expansion can yield a higher profit, which can support their household needs and her children\u2019s education plans. Ni Nyoman Noriani is very grateful for the loan given through DINARI.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTinggal dilingkungan yang penduduknya sebagian besar beragama Hindu membuat Ni Nyoman Noriani mempunyai peluang untuk membuka usaha berjualan Kamen ( pakaian adat Bali ) dan berbagai sarana keperluan sembahyang untuk umat Hindu. Hal ini dilakukan karena penghasilan suaminya sebagai seorang petani tidak mencukupi untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga. Apalagi sekarang kedua anaknya sudah duduk dibangku sekolah. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1000.000.- Ni Nyoman Noriani membangun usahanya ini. Barang dagangan ia beli di pasar yang ada di kotanya, karena pembelanjaan dilakukan secara rutin maka sekarang Ni Nyoman Noriani sudah mempunyai langganan tetap untuk pembelian barang dagangan tersebut. Dengan modal yang sedikit tentulah keuntungan yang diperoleh pun sedikit, dan itu hanya cukup untuk kebutuhan dapur saja. Oleh sebab itu Ni Nyoman Noriani mengajukan pinjaman modal ke Yayasan Dinari ,untuk menambah modal usahanya. Dengan modal tersebut sekarang Ni Nyoman Noriani bisa membeli Kamen dan juga perlengkapan sembahyang dengan jenis yang lebih banyak lagi ,sehingga pembeli bisa memilih sesuai dengan selera mereka. Pengembangan usaha ini diharapkan dapat memberi keuntungan yang lebih banyak ,sehingga kebutuhan keluarga dapat tercukupi dan anak-anak bisa bersekolah kejenjang yang lebih tinggi. Ni Nyoman Noriani sangat berterimakasih atas pinjaman modal yang diberikan oleh Dinari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":136533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy Hindu worship means in bigger quantities and wider selections so that customers can have more options","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-12T04:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman Noriani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-26T15:32:20Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-26T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":343447.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":192064,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":343447.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219740,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":343447.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":248918,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":343447.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277578,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T06:58:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":343447.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305968,"comment":null},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":343447.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338106,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":316333.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371933,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

dibangku SMU dan SMP. Setiap tahun Desak Putu Arsini harus mengeluarkan uang sebesar Rp.1.000.000.- untuk membayar sewa rumah. Pekerjaan suaminya sebagai sopir angkot tidak dapat mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga, apalagi sekarang  muatan sudah sepi karena kebanyakan masyarakat sudah mempunyai sepeda motor sendiri. Karena keinginan Desak Putu Arsini supaya anak-anaknya bisa bersekolah, maka ia berjuang keras dengan membuka usaha membuat kue-kue untuk sembahyang umat Hindu. Peluang ini didapat karena dilingkungan Desak Putu Arsini semua masyarakatnya memeluk agama Hindu, yang hampir setiap bulan memerlukan kue-kue tersebut. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1.000.000 Desak Putu Arsini memulai usaha ini. Bahan \u2013bahan seperti tepung,gula ,ketan ,alat-alat penjemuran dibeli di pasar. Dengan modal sedikit, tentu saja kue yang dihasilkan juga sedikit sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh tentu pula sedikit dan hanya cukup untuk keperluan dapur saja. Karena keterbatasan modal tersebut maka Desak Putu Arsini tidak dapat melayani pelanggan dengan maksimal,sedangkan masyarakat yang membutuhkan kue sangat banyak. Oleh sebab itu Desak Putu Arsini mengajukan pinjaman Modal Kepada Yayasan Dinari, dengan harapan dapat melayani masyarakat lebih banyak lagi sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih banyak pula. Dan Desak Putu Arsini dapat menyekolahkan anak-anaknya ke jenjang yang lebih tinggi,dan ia mempunyai keinginan untuk dapat menabung agar nantinya bisa mempunyai rumah sendiri. Desak Putu Arsini sangat berterimakasih atas pinjaman yang diberikan Oleh Yayasan Dinari."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":136568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","use":"Membeli bahan baku dan peralatan yang menunjang usahanya","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Desak Putu Arsini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":39437,"name":"Em","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Em S., age 38, is a mother of 5 children.

Abdulloev is 41 years old. He is married with three children.<p>\r\n\r\nIsok is an entrepreneur. In 1988, Isok graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in Ukraine, with a specialty in engineering. Unfortunately, he was not able to find a job in his specialty. At that time, being the head of his family, he decided to work the land and grow agricultural crops. <p>\r\nTwo years ago, Isok started a business selling small cattle.

Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":136690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To increase her inventory of medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-06T18:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magreth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-20T18:54:03Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-04-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":101970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187514,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-05-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":101970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":215495,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-06-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":101970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244311,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-07-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":101970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":272701,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-08-20T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":101970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302017,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-09-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":101970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332798,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-24T07:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":101970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":366932,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":84,"local_amount":95999.99,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":97334.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347519,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":101390.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970139,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":101390.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886389,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-06T19:54:03Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":39514,"name":"Ly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ly C. is a widow with three children; two sons and one daughter.

The food is all local--rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana)--and served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":136693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more ingredients in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-06T20:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-20T21:20:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18,"local_amount":20571.43,"processed_date":"2008-04-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":20857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188130,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":18,"local_amount":20571.43,"processed_date":"2008-05-21T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216243,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":18,"local_amount":20571.43,"processed_date":"2008-06-21T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":20857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245086,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":18,"local_amount":20571.43,"processed_date":"2008-07-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":273518,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":18,"local_amount":20571.43,"processed_date":"2008-08-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302957,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":18,"local_amount":20571.43,"processed_date":"2008-09-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":20857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":333775,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":18,"local_amount":20571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-24T07:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":20857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368027,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":14,"local_amount":15999.99,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16222.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347520,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":20278.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970140,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":20278.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886390,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-06T22:20:47Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":39516,"name":"Joanitha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

She pays $100 annually for her rent. Her husband\u2019s income as a public transportation driver is insufficient to meet their family needs, especially now that it is declining because people have their own motorcycles. Desak Putu Arsini is determined to keep her children in school, and fights for this will by starting her business to make sweets for Hindu worshippers. She has this opportunity because people in her neighborhood are Hindu, and they need the ceremonial sweets almost every month. <p>With a starting capital of $100, Desak Putu Arsini started her business. She buys sweets ingredients, such as flour, sugar and sticky rice, as well as drying tools at the market. Since her capital is small, she can only produce small amount of sweets, and thus, she only gains small profits, which are just enough to bring food to the table. Because of this capital limitation, Desak Putu Arsini cannot serve her customers to the maximum, while there are many people who need the sweets. That is why she requested a loan from DINARI Foundation with hope that she can serve even more customers and gain more profits. Desak Putu Arsini wants to send her children to the highest education possible, and hopes to save up for buying her own house. She is very grateful for the loan given through DINARI Foundation.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDesak Putu Arsini tinggal disebuah rumah kontrakan yang sangat sederhana bersama suami dan dua orang anaknya yang kini sudah duduk dibangku SMU dan SMP. Setiap tahun Desak Putu Arsini harus mengeluarkan uang sebesar Rp.1.000.000.- untuk membayar sewa rumah. Pekerjaan suaminya sebagai sopir angkot tidak dapat mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga, apalagi sekarang  muatan sudah sepi karena kebanyakan masyarakat sudah mempunyai sepeda motor sendiri. Karena keinginan Desak Putu Arsini supaya anak-anaknya bisa bersekolah, maka ia berjuang keras dengan membuka usaha membuat kue-kue untuk sembahyang umat Hindu. Peluang ini didapat karena dilingkungan Desak Putu Arsini semua masyarakatnya memeluk agama Hindu, yang hampir setiap bulan memerlukan kue-kue tersebut. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1.000.000 Desak Putu Arsini memulai usaha ini. Bahan \u2013bahan seperti tepung,gula ,ketan ,alat-alat penjemuran dibeli di pasar. Dengan modal sedikit, tentu saja kue yang dihasilkan juga sedikit sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh tentu pula sedikit dan hanya cukup untuk keperluan dapur saja. Karena keterbatasan modal tersebut maka Desak Putu Arsini tidak dapat melayani pelanggan dengan maksimal,sedangkan masyarakat yang membutuhkan kue sangat banyak. Oleh sebab itu Desak Putu Arsini mengajukan pinjaman Modal Kepada Yayasan Dinari, dengan harapan dapat melayani masyarakat lebih banyak lagi sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih banyak pula. Dan Desak Putu Arsini dapat menyekolahkan anak-anaknya ke jenjang yang lebih tinggi,dan ia mempunyai keinginan untuk dapat menabung agar nantinya bisa mempunyai rumah sendiri. Desak Putu Arsini sangat berterimakasih atas pinjaman yang diberikan Oleh Yayasan Dinari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":136955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy ingredients for sweets and supporting tools for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T19:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Desak Putu Arsini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-24T04:25:07Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190577,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218091,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:15:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246111,"comment":null},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275674,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305214,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336193,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":318413.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":370383,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

With the initial loan of $80, Gusti Komang Armini buys ingredients for \u201cjajan\u201d (ceremonial sweets) such as sticky rice, palm sugar, flour and baking tools. She does this from morning to afternoon. From afternoon to evening, Gusti Komang Armini makes \u201ccanang\u201d (ceremonial offerings) for Hindu worshippers. She buys materials such as young coconut leaves, palm leaves and flowers from people who bring those to her house. Gusti Komang Armini is overwhelmed by the many orders and frequent patrons of her business. Her limited capital cannot buy enough raw materials to catch up with these many orders. She uses the profits of her business to provide food for her family. Gusti Komang Armini requested a loan from DINARI Foundation as an addition to her capital so that she can produce more jajan and canang, especially now that the religious Hindu holidays are coming. With this loan, Gusti Komang Armini hopes that she can expand her business and increase her profits.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nWalaupun usianya sudah menginjak  56 tahun, namun Gusti Komang Armini masih tetap giat dalam berusaha. Apalagi sekarang suaminya sudah mulai pensiun dari pegawai negeri sipil, tentu saja penghasilanya berkurang dan tidak cukup untuk keperluan keluarga. Dengan situasi sekarang ini semua harga kebutuhan pokok meningkat dan juga kegiatan upacara Umat Hindu sangat banyak. Karena itu walaupun Gusti Komang Armini sudah tua tetapi tetap enerjik dalam berusaha. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 800.000.-Gusti Komang Armini membeli bahan untuk jajan seperti ketan, gula merah, tepung, serta alat-alat untuk membuat jajan. Hal ini dikerjakan pada pagi hari hingga siang hari. Dan besoknya baru dipotong, kemudian dijemur. Sedangkan dari siang hingga sore Gusti Komang Armini membuat Canang ( sarana persembahyangan Umat Hindu ) untuk sembahyang Umat Hindu. Bahan seperti janur, daun kelapa serta bunga dibelinya dari masyarakat yang setiap hari membawa kerumahnya. Karena banyak yang membutuhkan dan sudah mempunyai langganan yang tetap, maka Gusti Komang Armini merasa kewalahan untuk melayani pelanggan.Disamping itu juga modal yang dimiliki hanya sedikit,tidak cukup untuk membeli bahan denga jumlah yang banyak. Keuntungan yang diperoleh selama ini dipergunakan untuk keperluan dapur saja. Oleh sebab itu Gusti Komang Armini mengajukan pinjaman kepada Yayasan Dinari sebagai tambahan modal agar dapat memproduksi lebih banyak lagi dan semua pesanan dapat dipenuhi apalagi sekarang menjelang Hari raya Umat Hindu tentu saja banyak yang sudah mulai memesan jajan maupun canang. Dengan pinjaman ini Gst Komang Armini berharapan usahanya bisa berkembang dan keuntungan yang diperoleh bertambah sehingga nantinya dapat merenovasi rumahnya yang belum selesai dibangun."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":136957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy raw materials for worship means","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T19:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gusti Komang Armini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-24T14:18:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190578,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218092,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247068,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275675,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305215,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":345705.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336194,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":318413.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":370384,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -
