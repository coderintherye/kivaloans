The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fish and to strengthen their catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T22:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maymouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dior","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636069,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037979,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262083,"comment":null},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703067,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132653,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046922,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892471,"comment":null},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780979,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-14T03:11:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100763,"name":"Emin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emin R. is a 31-year-old farmer who breeds and sells calves in the local livestock bazaar.

These women know one another through ties of community and kinship.  They do almost the same work, selling <i>cola<\/i>, vegetables, and palm oil.  They are very experienced and in high demand in these fields.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith regard to improving the quality of their services and expanding their businesses, the members of this reliance group decided to join the micro-finance institution IMCEC.  They received a group loan before from IMCEC, and they indeed repaid it. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members plan to use this loan to replenish their stock of merchandise, which will be sold retail, cash accepted, at the Grand Thi\u00e8s marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average profit of 25,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy vegetables ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-10T00:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bamby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Gnagna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Balla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Aissatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636071,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037981,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262085,"comment":null},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703069,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132655,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046924,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892473,"comment":null},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780981,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-10T08:19:25Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:58:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100782,"name":"Nabulola Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. M.

Elles esp\u00e8rent r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 30,000 CFA ($60) au cours de ce cycle qui sera utilis\u00e9 pour rembourser les int\u00e9r\u00eats du pr\u00eat, subvenir au besoin de la famille et investir le reste dans les activit\u00e9s. ","en":"\u201cAssociation Femme D\u00e9veloppement Entreprise AFDE Num\u00e9ro 18\u201d is composed of five women who average 40 years of age and who live in large traditional extended families in the Cit\u00e9 Lamy district in Thi\u00e8s, a city located 70 km from Dakar, the capital of Senegal.  These women know one another through ties of community and kinship.  They do almost the same work, selling fish.  They are very experienced and in high demand in this field.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith regard to improving the quality of their services and expanding their businesses, the members of this reliance group decided to join the micro-finance institution IMCEC.  They received a group loan before from IMCEC, and they indeed repaid it. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members plan to use this loan to replenish their stock of fish, which they\u2019re going to sell retail, cash accepted, at the Grand Thi\u00e8s marketplace.  Fish is an essential part of Senegalese cuisine, so there is always a lot of demand.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average profit of 30,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fish ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-10T00:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bafou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636072,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037982,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262086,"comment":null},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703070,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132656,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046925,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892474,"comment":null},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780982,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:05Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:58:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100786,"name":"Marachi B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Z.

is a mother of four and is married to Corat.

With this loan, Marygine plans to purchase eight buckets of potatoes, ten buckets of cocoyams and 18 buckets of beans, including three buckets of koki beans.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual repayment schedule and the ability to set aside some of her profits, Marygine is confident her business will continue to succeed.  With this loan, Marygine believes that her business will help her community because she is providing more food to choose from at a convenient location.  \r\n\r\nAs her business profits from the loan, Marygine will be able to expand her business, buy food and needed items for her family, and most importantly, pay for her children's school fees.  Out of her four children, three of them are under the age of fifteen.  The ability to pay for these costs helps Marygine and her family, especially since they have faced some of life's challenges, like deep poverty.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":301198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy potatoes, cocoyams, beans, and koki beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Three Corners, Belo, N.W.

The women know one another through ties of community and kinship, and they do almost the same work, selling cloth and sewing supplies.  They are in high demand in these field. \r\n<p>\r\nWith regard to improving the quality of their services and expanding their businesses, the members of this reliance group decided to join the micro-finance institution IMCEC and are now on their second solidarity loan (group loan).  Their first loan was correctly repaid. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, the group members plan to build a sizable stock of cloth and sewing supplies, which will be sold, cash accepted, at the grand marketplace of Thi\u00e8s.  \r\n<p>\r\nEach group member hopes to realize an average profit of 25,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy cloth and sewing supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-10T15:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nd\u00e9ye Diabaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nogaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bator ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636077,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037987,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262091,"comment":null},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703075,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132661,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046930,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892479,"comment":null},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-13T14:51:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100819,"name":"Magnus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magnus N. is 35 years old.

Currently she is into the sale of cooking utensils and selling of lace and clothing materials. She sells through hawking, house-to-house selling; she had 10 years experience in sewing until the pathetic incident occurred. Jennifer also travels to the nearby communities to sell during their market days. She is adapting to her new predicament. Jennifer needs money to provide for her child, herself and the family.

is married with three children who are in school. Two of her children are working while the last born is still breast feeding. Ama T. is a 44 year old trader. She lives with her husband and children in a family house at Twifo Praso. She believes in hard work and dedication as the primary antidote to minimizing poverty and, for that matter, she is very serious with her business.\r\n<p>\r\nShe trades in cereals like maize, plantains, and others like cocoyam etc. She started this business four years ago. Ama makes a living through the profits she makes from her output and through this Ama has been very resourceful to her family.\r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy a larger supply of maize, plantains and cocoyam to serve her customers throughout the season, especially in the face of increasing prices due to the current food crisis in the country.

His wife works as a teacher in a secondary school. Domullo has been working as a traffic cop for twelve years, but has retired early due to worsened health. His pension is not enough to cover life expenses and this is why he decided to start a business by raising and reselling cattle.

","en":"Toshpulot is a client of MicroInvest since 2004. He lives in a kishlak (village) of Tubchok in the Utkansoy region which is located in the most remote corner of Tajikistan near the mountains. In this region most of the men have left to the Russian Federation. But because Toshpulot has a good income from his plot of land and his animal husbandry business he thinks that he can earn his bread here in his motherland.

He drives a taxi on the Dushanbe-Varzob route. In addition, for the past three years he has kept bees.  He has a farm and several swarms of bees.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent have viable business propositions.

Valijon has always been hard-working and committed to ensure that his family never goes without its daily bread. He is married, has two children, and runs a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foods. With starting capital of $500, Valijon opened his shop 10 years ago. Since that time, it has continually expanded to the point where his wife (seen here in the photo) also helps out in the shop. Valijon has applied for a loan of $1,000 to buy additional products to sell in his store. He wants prospective lenders to know that he is ready to work even harder and make sacrifices  to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will be key success factors in his small business.   \r\n    \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have solid business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":301588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Items for resale in general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Three Corners, Belo, N.W.

She will also use part of the loan for covering the transportation costs she will incur while buying the clothing. \r\n\r\nHaving grown a solid customer base, Grace can see that her business will be successful. She is a savvy business woman who is confident in her business skills. She also notes that the location of her business, near the market, is advantageous. \r\n\r\nAlthough Grace has many children, she still has a hard time thinking about the death of one of her sons. From the time he was born he was really sick. After 12 years he finally passed away. \r\n\r\nThis is Grace's second loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2007. With the profits from this loan, she plans to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and test both her children and herself for HIV. She also has plans to add to her family farm. Grace takes out GHAPE loans because after comparing them to other microfinance NGOs she thinks the training they give makes them the best. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":301591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Children and women\u2019s clothing and transportation costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Three Corners, Belo, N.W.

B., 54 and married with six children, is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children. He has great experience in cattle breeding, having been involved in it for 31 years, and over time he has increased his sales significantly. Since the business has been going well, he would like it to expand it and so is requesting a loan of $1200 to buy young cattle. He and his family thank you very much for the support that you offer them in continuing this business and helping them give the children a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, \n\nscientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), \n\nFirdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The \n\ncountry is home to communities that still speak the ancient \n\nSogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th \n\nmillennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the \n\nIslamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central \n\nAsian traditions.\n\nTajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A \n\ncivil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the \n\nU.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, \n\n93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is \n\narable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of \n\nunemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work \n\nin other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of \n\nTajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity \n\nand the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the \n\npopulation still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with \n\nKiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients \n\nrepresent viable business prospects.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mardonkul is a 62-year-old man. His wife works as a housekeeper, and they have four children. His family plans include moving forward with crop production so that he can financially support his children\u2019s studies.\r\n<p>\r\nThe biggest problem Mardonkul faces is that pest insects have affected his crops, and he does not have enough money to deal with the problem. He has been working in agriculture for 20 years. He is requesting this loan in order to use it for his crops, thus thwarting losses.\r\n<p>\r\nAgriculture is his family\u2019s source of income. For this reason, Mardonkul gives thanks to IMON and Kiva for the support it gives him via this loan, which will be of great benefit to his crops.\r\n<p><br>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alice was born on June 20, 1970 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She attended school through the 11th grade, although she dropped out due to a lack of financial support.  She is married and the mother of six children, four of whom are in school;  the other two are not yet school-age.  After dropping out, Alice used to help her mother with selling roasted cashew nuts.  But in 1989, she got started on her own, again selling roasted cashews.  She grills the nuts and then places them into bottles for sale.  She notes the high demand for this product.  This is why she needs more funds than she has to buy cashews, so as to address the demands of her customers. \r\n<p>\r\n<i>ALID\u00c9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

She sells fried dough and sausages and eggs. Her present working capital amounts to about US$ 200. <P>\r\n\r\nWivine has her sales point in a neighborhood in the center of Kinshasa where she has lots of customers. She began by selling chickens in 1989. Her intital capital was US$ 40. From 1990 to 1993, with the profits she had accumulated from her business,  Wivine diversified and added the sale of sausages which she bought wholesale and delivered to grocery stores. This brought her working capital up to US$ 1,000. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Wivine fell victim to the pillaging in Kinshasa and lost all her merchandise. She was left without merchandise and without funds. Thus, from 1994 to 2004, she tried selling cases of soap without success. In 2003 she was caught off balance at the death of her husband.  She changed her business in 2005 to begin selling spices which brought her to a significant capital of US$ 2,400--which sadly was stolen by robbers. <P>\r\n\r\nAround the end of that same year, Wivine took up selling fried dough again with the insignificant working capital of $20, a business she has continued until this day. Her business is growing rapidly and producing a profit of US$ 30 per week. The loan that she has received has allowed her to buy 1 sack of wheat flour, 1 jerrycan of 25 liters of refined vegetable oil, sugar, and other ingredients for making fried dough in order to grow her profit. Her dream is to open up a drinks depot so as to be able to supply retailers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

His wife does not work outside the home, since they have three children, one of whom is still nursing.  Bahodurhon must work to earn a living to feed and educate his children.  He has taken out a loan to install a natural gas fuel system on his vehicle.    Once the equipment is installed, it will be cheaper to fill his tank with natural gas than it was to use gasoline, thus increasing his profit.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva

The profit that we made from our former business sustained us. <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough we did not manage to put by any savings, we were at least able to cater for the basic needs of our families. Thus, we intend to take up a business selling different products that are produced here and sell the utensils that the inhabitants need.  \r\n\r\nNote: one member of our group, Rokhaya  G., was not

Aziadeko's family is from Ganvi\u00e9, a lake village in Benin. He lost his father during his childhood, and was raised by his uncle Mahufin T.. Aziadeko never attended school. He's a widower and the father of 8 children : two of his daughters are already married, but he still has to provide for the other three. His three sons are apprentices.\r\n<p>\r\nSince he was 6 years old, he's been going fishing with his uncle. After his marriage, Aziadeko continued this business. Aziadeko already benefited from three loans from Kiva's partner, Alid\u00e9. These loans enabled him to buy small boats to go fishing. He's seeking a fourth loan to bolster his fishing business, in order to increase his profits to better provide for his children.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Alid\u00e9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

She has been quite successful in the past with her \u201cbuy and sell\u201d business due to her location in the quarter and her reasonable prices. She purchases most of her products where they are much cheaper in bulk, and retails them at her store. She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \n \nWith the profits from this loan, Elizabeth plans to send her children to school and support them after school. She will also consider buying more piglets for her pig farm. Her profits will also provide her with the security of knowing she can afford hospital bills and health costs.\n\nAbout GHAPE\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Margaret runs a small \"buy and sell\" stand in Nkwen Market.  With this loan, she plans to invest in more products to sell at her stand.  Some of these products include rice, onions, groundnut oil, beans, tomatoes, salt, palm oil, and soybeans.  Her business plan shows she will invest 50,000 CFA of her own savings as well.  \r\n \r\nThis will be Margaret's second loan from GHAPE.  She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location (right on the main Market), the variety of her products, and her reasonable prices.  She purchases most of her products where they are much cheaper, and sells them at her stall.  For many customers in her community, this saves the transportation costs and the time of going to Bamenda themselves to purchase these items.  She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \r\n \r\nThe profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of Margaret's children. Also, she plans to reinvest in her businesses to help it grow. Margaret does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments every two weeks.  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":301761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Provisions for store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

On weekends he goes out to the local markets and, when possible, buys inexpensive cattle there.  If it all works out, he sells them right away, but if not takes them home and tries the next market a week later.  This is his additional source of income to support his family.

Thus, Mrs. Kosal P. decided to ask for a loan to buy more fishnets and others tools for her husband\u2019s fishing.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is 40 years old and the mother of four children, three of whom are employed in a garment factory while the other is attending the local school. Mrs. Reth C. does not come to take a loan but her husband does, so he is presented in the picture instead her.

Because of their sewing skills, they decided to venture into the tailoring business, but they did not have access to capital.  With determination and courage, Mrs. A. applied for membership at Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative, and borrowed Php 10,000 through the cooperative.\r\n\r\nThe small business is going so well that Mrs. A. has decided to expand it.  She is seeking $425 to purchase an additional sewing machine.  Mrs. A. paid her previous loan in a timely fashion, and is a member in good standing of the cooperative.  She has high hopes that God will bless her business.  Mrs. A. and her family hope to set up their own tailoring shop in the city when their profits allow.  In the future, she wants to see all her children finish their studies, and to renovate her family's

She was recognized by the co-op in July 2005 and has availed herself six times of the credit service offered by the program. Now she has applied for an amount of Php 14,900.00, to be used to pay for labor in repairing and cultivating an extension of the fishpond. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore Loreta became a member of Paglaum, her family suffered financially. Their only source of living comes from fishing, and earnings are unpredictable because they use only a fishing net. After having accessed the credit services as a Paglaum member, Loreta reports significant financial improvements in her family\u2019s well-being. She is grateful for the help she has received from Paglaum because it has contributed so much to her family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe couple is hoping that they will always experience a good and abundant harvest

Mrs. Josebel T. was able to buy her Video-5 machine with help from the Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative. She joined the co-op in July, 2008, and has already taken out and repaid several loans. She is applying for a new loan to repair and repaint the motorcycle which her husband uses at work. She also plans to buy another motorcycle in the near future.
