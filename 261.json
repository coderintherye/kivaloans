She has always given of herself for her 6 children and has tried to provide what is best for them.  As a widow, she has learned to assume new responsibilities and roles within her home.  Working in different businesses gave her the opportunity to acquire and construct other homes in her area.  She began renting out apartments, which is one of the most profitable businesses in her area due to the high demand for housing in her district.  For the past 5 years, she has handled the monthly billing to her tenants, who are very punctual.  She seeks to provide them with the necessary conditions to make them comfortable.  \r\n<p>\r\nFelicita would like to install additional bathrooms, improve the exterior fa\u00e7ade, and build additional units that can be rented out to single tenants.  Therefore, she wants to enlarge her building so that she can convert it into a lodging house in the future.  This will not only provide her with great financial returns, but it will also help numerous families secure housing.  Felicita is taking out her first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and hopes to remain part of a larger group of members involved with the Institution who demonstrate responsibility and commitment.  Her loan of 3000 soles will be used to remodel existing rooms and construct new rooms for rent.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

her husband and their two children in the Santa Rosa district.  It is purely a fishing region, which is located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nThey run a small restaurant where they wait on the fishermen in the region.  The business allowed them to buy a piece of land where they are now building their house.  They are now living there.  But, there has not been enough income from the business to finish the house.  The house still needs a roof, doors, and plaster.  The close location to the sea makes finishing the construction urgent.  The cold nights could affect the health of their two children, who are 9 and 5, because the roof is covered by metal pieces and the door is made of plywood.\r\n\r\nThat is why they are asking the Institution for a loan of 3,100 PEN to help finish their house and keep working in their small restaurant.  They want their children to grow up in a house that gives them real security.\r\n\r\nThey have worked with the Institution five times, and they have paid back their loans punctually.

B. is a 24-year-old auto repairman who lives in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia with his wife, a cashier and sorter at the local post office, and two-year-old son.  B. has been working as an auto repairman since 1994, when he began helping his father repair vehicles at his new auto repair business. In 2003, B. inherited the business from his father and began running it himself. Even though he is young, he has developed good auto repair skills due to his many years of experience in the business, and has developed a reputation as a good repairman throughout his community. Another advantage to his business is the good equipment, tools and other assets, which he inherited from his father. This gives him many advantages over his competition. Because of these factors, Bat-Erdene has been able to improve his business and increase his working capital to 2,000,000 tugrugs (approx. $1381 USD) from 300,000 tugrugs (approx. $207 USD) when he started. Bat-Erdene has used the profits from his business to build a two-story house for him and his family. For the future, Bat-Erdene says, \"My dear wish is to expand my business by providing quality service\". He is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 tugrugs to purchase materials and parts needed for auto repair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":372564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase spare parts ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Tsetserleg, Arhangai","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2009-08-19T08:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bat-Erdene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":166066},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167264}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.24},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.73,"local_amount":166755,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-16T00:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":168555.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73707156,"comment":null},{"amount":117.95,"local_amount":168502,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":170321.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87136550,"comment":null},{"amount":120.08,"local_amount":171546,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":173398.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97050968,"comment":null},{"amount":111.97,"local_amount":159964,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:26:46Z","rounded_local_amount":161691.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103896609,"comment":null},{"amount":933.27,"local_amount":1333233,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T11:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1347631.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110785267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T08:18:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-16T11:32:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":130189,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine B. is from the village of Barangay 3, Talakag, Bukidnon.

She gains income through a daily transport boundary basis of PHP200.00.  For additional income, she also ventured into meat vending.  She will first get orders from customers and then deliver them to their houses using a motorcycle. She gains a good income in this business and she is thankful that through the business she is able to help her husband support the education of their children. Wanting to improve her pork vending leads her to seek the support of Kiva lenders.  She hopes to borrow a loan amounting to PHP7,000 that she will use for the maintenance of their motorcycle that she uses to deliver fresh pork and for her transport business. \t\r\n\r\n

Their four children are all studying. They need to help each other to give them a good education so that some day all of them will have a good future. Their eldest is now 13 years old, studying in high school with their second child. The two younger children are both in elementary school. \r\n<p>\r\nAlicia is asking for a loan to be used as additional business capital to purchase commodities for her general store. She hopes to access a loan of 10,000 PHP that will surely be very useful in the improvement of her store. Alicia believes that time is gold; thus, they work very hard and help each other in the progress of their daily lives, doing their best not to waste time for nothing. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n

However, most of the financial and emotional investments she had then vanished when her husband died just recently. She spend thousands of money for her husband's medication before the death and even until the burial. Having her only 11-year-old child beside her, Edna realized she has to be strong to restart running her general store business for her child's education and future.\n\nFrom a Php12,000 previously, Edna chose to lessen the amount she will loan now despite her qualification for loaning large amount because she will start all over again and for the first time, without her husband's support.

Eliza C. started with a variety store business when her sister gave her small amount of money for a capital after the death of her husband in 2004. She had two children that goes to school then. One in college and the other is in high school. Profit she had at that time wasn't enough for all expenses required by the education of her children and their personal needs thus, business was sporadic because capital was misused most of the times.\n\nWhen one of her children is graduating from college, the financial need for her education is increasing affecting the stability of her business. Then, she realized she needs loan to sustain the financial need of her business and for making it grow to profit bigger. After paying her previous loans in ASHI, now she wants to loan larger amount for her business. Her two children are helping her in managing her store.

Luz plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":372636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Christopher already has decided on a particular model available at a downtown retail store, and will use his loan to make a down-payment.  \r\nChristopher is extremely excited about the work that K-MET is doing and wants to recruit new members so that they can benefit from K-MET's work in the community.

B. is from the village of La Victoria, Aurora, Zamboanga del sur. She is 59 years old. Agripina is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Agripina operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising cows for sale. Agripina is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Agripina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Agripina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Agripina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Agripina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Salvacion and her husband Rolly got married, they have been raising pigs for their hog business. They started with one piglet that they raised and sold. This is their source of income to support the basic needs of their four children and their education. However, the hog business alone cannot finance the family's financial needs, therefore Salvacion also sells fish. Even with all of her hard work and perseverance, the business wasn't stable because of insufficient business capital. In 2003, Salvacion joined Ahon Sa HIrap, Inc. (ASHI). She took out a loan from the institution to finance her business. As a result of the loans she received, her business has grown and she has been able to send all of her children to school. Three are high school graduates and her 8 year old youngest child is in elementary school. \r\n\r\nOut of the profits her business had generated, Salvacion was able to buy a motorcycle. Her desire for taking out a larger loan from ASHI is to increase her hog business and her profits to be able to buy a sidecar to attach to her motorcycle for a tricycle for hire business in the future.\r\n\r\nTricycle is one of the most common means of transportation all over the province. With this business, Salvacion could provide a daily income for her family's needs. She also hoped that out of her business profits her two children who are still in school will graduate from college."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":372713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To support her

Divina has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Divina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Divina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Divina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Divina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":372563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

M. is from the city of Dipolog.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Marilyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Marilyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Lucia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and then sell. Lucia is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Lucia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions and pay the tuition of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

G. is from the village of La Victoria, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 60 years old. Eufracia is married and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Eufracia owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Eufracia has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eufracia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eufracia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase piglets to raise and sell in future. Eufracia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Eufracia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

By offering a range of clothing items, she provides a convenient stop for her customers who often will buy more than just one item from her. Gulshan has requested a loan to increase her working capital and help sustain her business. Purchasing inventory from wholesalers has required a substantial investment from Gulshan, which is why she decided to obtain a loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Sabohat is a brave married woman who works hard for the good of her two children.

Sabohat\u2019s children\u2019s grateful attitude continues to encourage her, and they have learned many lessons during this time that they can use when they form their own households.

Sabohat doesn\u2019t just need good land; she also needs a friendly hand to help her out.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

BRAC has become one of the world's largest NGOs as a measured by the scale and diversity of its interventions.  In 2007, BRAC started operations in Southern Sudan. The microfinance program, which is targeted towards returning war refugees, has already formed 418 village organizations with more than 14,000 women

She has seven children, all of whom are adults. Her principal business activity is preparing smoked fish. She buys fish every morning in the St. Pierre neighborhood of Porto-Novo and then prepares them at her house. Marie makes a smoky fire under a grill and lets the fish smoke until they are blackened. She covers the fish to preserve the moisture. When she is finished, Marie sells the fish on the streets of Porto-Novo. Marie also sells tomatoes on the side.\r\n  \r\nMarie has been preparing smoked fish for thirteen years.

Today, her husband and family have managed to buy the house in which they currently live.  Thanks to her hard work and that of her husband, they have been able to save enough money to purchase a car that helps provide their main source of income.  Mar\u00eda handles the daily business administration while her husband focuses on driving the taxi.  She makes sure that the vehicle operates efficiently and schedules the required maintenance.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband leaves around 8am for work and is gone all day, while she prepares the meals and cares of their children.  This arrangement works very well because it gives her true independence since she has time for herself.  Mar\u00eda wants to generate more income so that she can buy another vehicle and, over time, eventually have a large fleet of taxis.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes to continue growing as a micro-entrepreneur.  Mar\u00eda is requesting her 10th loan from MFP and she has always been on time with her payments.  She will use the money to replace the tires on her vehicle so that it will be in optimal condition.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":372957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Replace the tires on her vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-20T09:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":217.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":259.04},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":266.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":282.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":292.41},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":306.03},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":326.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":335.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":351.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":362.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.59},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.91},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.16,"local_amount":217.05,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":218.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081193,"comment":null},{"amount":88.5,"local_amount":259.04,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":260.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997344,"comment":null},{"amount":91.18,"local_amount":266.85,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":268.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842688,"comment":null},{"amount":350.43,"local_amount":1025.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-22T09:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734270,"comment":null},{"amount":62.2,"local_amount":182.06,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":182.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992382,"comment":null},{"amount":114.61,"local_amount":335.45,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":336.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717213,"comment":null},{"amount":243.92,"local_amount":713.9,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":717.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751006,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-28T02:57:25Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":130434,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresa is a 57-year-old trader.

She is a dressmaker by training.  Isabelle\u2019s secondary business involves selling cloth, jewelry, soaps, and aluminum utensils.  To meet her needs and those of her family, she has dedicated herself to this second business.  Basically, she buys her goods at Dantokpa, the grand international marketplace of Benin.  She distributes these goods on credit to customers who ordered them;  every five days, she comes around to collect.  \r\n\r\nIsabelle has already benefited from an initial ALID\u00e9 loan that she has repaid.

Luna, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nMrs. K. knew that the small income that her husband earned was not enough for her dream for her children. This is the reason why she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon - to borrow enough capital to start a business to supplement her husband's income.\r\n\r\nUsing her first loan, she put up a food stall, selling different kind of fruit in the local market of Cadiz. She noticed that her business income helped her very much with the needs of her family. Her business is doing well and earns about PHP 12,000 per month.\r\n\r\nThis new loan of Php 13,000 is Mrs. K.'s 9th and will be utilized for the purchase of additional inventory and as working capital.

To improve her productivity she used her savings to buy a washing machine. The sudden death of her husband has been very hard for Erminia. After his death she joined FINCA and accrued more capital that has helped bring her more customers. Erminia is requesting a loan of 1,200 soles to buy fabric materials to make curtains and furniture linens. Her dream is to have a successful sewing business. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":373123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"buy fabric materials to make curtains and furniture linens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-08-19T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":208.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87032589,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":208.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96944854,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":208.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103786789,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":208.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110677308,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-17T09:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":208.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110677309,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":208.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072035,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-19T21:44:19Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:24:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":130534,"name":"Gladys Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladiy is a member of the Purple Christ communal bank.

He lives at home with parents and would like nothing more than to give them a peaceful retirement.  Fredy delivers gas in order to earn money so that he can complete his technical studies.  He is very fast and efficient, which has led him to being promoted to the position of primary distributor of his branch and the right hand of his boss.  What he likes most about his job is that he gets to make his deliveries on a motorbike instead of having to walk through the streets of the city.   He has been in this business for 3 years, and he believes the most difficult part of his job is carrying gas tanks to the upper floors of buildings, which easily makes him tired.  In the future, he would like to start his own gas distribution business so that he can make more money.\r\n<p>\r\nFredy is happy to be receiving his 5th loan with MFP because he plans to invest it well.  He is highly respected by the rest of his Communal Bank because he always brings order to the group.

M. is from the village of Poblacion, Mambajao, Camiguin. She is forty-five years old and married with two school-age children. To make a living, Nancy owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a sari-sari (variety) shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Nancy has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately $62 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn July of 2009, Nancy joined HSPFI, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Nancy is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her first loan from HSPFI. Nancy plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Her husband works as a driver for the local electricity department, her son attends a local secondary school, and her daughter is a university student. Tserendugjir operates a small felt producing shop in the town along with 4 other people. Together they  produce a variety of felt products including slippers, bags, hats,  jackets and other handicrafts. The group uses only locally available materials  such as sheep and camel wool to make their products. Tserendugjir started her business in 2006 and has since found much success. She has taught all of her children how to make slippers and they help her during their school vacations. Tserendugjir is a very open-minded and responsible businesswoman and her dream is to one day have her own souvenir shop where she and other local handicraft makers can sell their products. She is requesting a 2 million tugrug (approx. $1,380 USD) loan to purchase wool processing equipment that will enable her to increase the productivity of her business and the quality of her

S. is 50 years old and lives with his wife and two kids in Chingeltei, a district of Mongolia's capital city, Ulaanbaatar. His oldest daughter currently attends the State Education University and his youngest son is a 5th grade student. His wife, Enkhtuya, has worked as a surgery nurse at a maternity hospital for 20 years. Enkhbat operates a small food store business at a shop in his khashaa (yard) beside his home.\r\n\r\nHe named the store \"Enkh-Uud\" and explained that this is because both he and his wife's name include \"enkh\" in them. Enkhbat started his food store business in 2007 and it has been very successful. Today, his business capital exceeds 2.0 million Tugrugs.

Hotamdjon is 41 years old. He is married and has three children. Hotamdjon is a noble worker dedicated to raising animals, primarily cattle, which he buys and sells in the commercial city markets. This work is very agreeable to him, because raising animals is what he enjoys most. Hotamdjon requires a certain amount of money to increase the number of his cattle. His goal is to increase his livestock and thereby increase his household income, in addition to being solvent in order to continue working on buying and selling animals.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\"\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

loan for various purposes. Mrs. Channa P. is the 40-year-old village bank president. She owns a small business selling juice. Her husband, Mr. Mang Polo, is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice. In this plantation, he needs the money to buy fertilizer and gasoline to pump water to support the field. Thus, Mrs. Channa P. decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She has four children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while another is attending the local school and the youngest one is too young to work or study. (Mrs. Sorn MA. did not come to take the loan but her husband did, so he is in the picture instead her.) \r\n\r\nAll the members in this group loan have end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan's term.
