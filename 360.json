O. is twenty-five years old, married and has two children. Her business is located at Kisumu behind Kenyatta Sports Club. She has been selling dresses, trousers and shoes for the last three years to the local people.\r\n\r\nShe says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is that there are so many people in the area doing the same business as hers so customers are spoilt for choice. There are also the challenges of weather especially because her business is an open air market. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well.\r\n\r\nShe is using her loan of KES 30,000 to restock her business to grow it and to be able to serve more people.  She hopes to open a boutique someday. She also hopes to give her children quality educations. She is a very hardworking and creative lady."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":510046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Mary has been selling items such as rice, flour, oil, detergents, soft drinks, etc. for the last one and half years to the local people. She says that this business is profitable. Her major challenge is the number of people in the area with the same business as hers and so customers are overwhelmed with choice. However, she works very hard to keep her business going well. Mary is using her loan of KES 40,000 to buy more general items to expand her business. She hopes to be a wholesaler in the future, to provide her children with quality education and to own a house some day.

He says that this business is profitable, even though many people are in this line of work, which gives customers the ability to choose where to shop. Space is also difficult to find, and financial constraints have prevented him from expanding as much as he would like. Despite this, he works very hard to keep his business doing well.

Maria de los Angeles is married and has three children.  She wants to expand her business and open a small store that is away from her house.  Since there are no other stores in the area, she wants to keep her business well-stocked so that she can generate the most income.  With this loan, she will buy soft drinks, soap, eggs, sugar, and other items.  Her goals for the future are to provide a better life for her children and support them so that they can become professionals.\r\n<p>\r\nSo far, Maria is happy to be with a group that knows how to respond to any situation that presents itself.  As a unit, the members are supportive of one another.  She thanks Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for trusting them again by providing a new loan.

This is because she has become so attached to them that she loves them as if they were her own.  She tends to the center from 8am until 6pm;  a period of time when many mothers leave their children with her to be cared for.  They have several reasons for doing so: work, study, etc.  So Dogmelia, very patiently and with much dedication, assited by two young employees, tends to the children initiating them into the learning process with various challenging games and readings.  She enjoys her work very much and loves doing it.  This is why she would like, in the future, to enlarge the space of her \"Cuna-Escuela\" so that she can house more children.\r\n\r\nThis is Digmelia's 7th loan with MFP; she has never defrauded the institution.  On the contrary, she has been very punctual with every one of her payments.  Now, with the requested funds, she will buy some materials that she needs for her child care center so that the children will feel more comfortable.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

She has been a member of U-IMCEC (a Senegalese association of mutual savings and loans institutions) since July 2009. She has six children, the ages of whom range from two to 18 years old. Mrs. M. is a fish merchant and has been selling fish for five years. Not wanting to remain inactive, she followed the example of other women in her neighborhood who carry out this activity and make a profit from it. She prefers to focus on the cold season when there are more fish. This is the best season to make money. The profitability of her primary acitivity has allowed her to open a shop where she sells cosmetic products.

He makes a living selling dry goods, buying them wholesale and selling them retail in his town. He has been in business for five years, and hopes to expand his operations in the future. \r\n\r\nWhen he went into business, Amos was worth 3,000 Liberian dollars but by working hard has increased that to 16,000. The main problem he faces is transporting goods from his supplier to his shop.  He has few if any problems selling them once they arrive, because he is known for having reasonable prices. He has applied for this loan to buy more items to sell, including body cream and slippers to wear in the shower.\r\n\r\nAmos dreams of having enough money to give his children a good education.

Founded in 1994, the non-profit has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.  LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts a special emphasis on lending to women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":496257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more body cream and shower slippers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Harbel, Margibi County","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-02-26T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Finda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yassah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1239},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2205}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.92,"local_amount":4300,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4340.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711452,"comment":null},{"amount":68.71,"local_amount":4850,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4895.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144998002,"comment":null},{"amount":54.19,"local_amount":3825,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3860.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755579,"comment":null},{"amount":28.69,"local_amount":2025,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2043.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159667408,"comment":null},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8074.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166881047,"comment":null},{"amount":99.16,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":7065.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177588756,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T23:53:18Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T11:10:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":180446,"name":"Respe De Romeo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Respe de Romeo Group is excited about receiving their firS.loan from Esperanza.

She has been a shareholder-member of the Baye Laye savings bank since November 2001 and has already repaid two previous loans. \r\n\r\nShe is a single woman without children but is very ambitious. Ms. M. is a hairdresser by profession. She had eight years of experience during her training. Since obtaining her diploma she has opened a hairdressing salon. At the same time she sells handcrafted \"boubous\" (long-flowing suits or dresses), wigs and various articles coming from France. Because she moves around a lot, she is often helped by her younger sister, who appears by the way on the photo above. She loves hairdressing and for this reason she turned to it immediately after having failed her \"brevet\" (school certificate). The times that interest her the most in this activity are those when there are events such as end-of -year celebratons where demand for service is very high. Her greatest desire is to become an internationally renowned haidresser and to be able to carry out her business abroad. The loan agreed by U-IMCEC (a Senegalese association of mutual savings and loans institutions) will motivate her and strengthen her production capacity. The profits she makes will allow her to take care of her personal needs, to be independent and to save.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

He is a taxi driver and lives with his wife, Edith, who sells clothes.  Together, they educate their only daugther, who is five years old.  Thanks to their great effort and dedication, they were able to buy their own house, where they live happily.\r\n\r\nHilber learned how to drive when he was very young.  He has been a taxi driver for two years, and thanks to this, he is able to support his family.  Hilber offers his transportation services from the early hours in the morning until dusk.  It is very tiresome work because he has to go to all the different places his customers ask.  In spite of all the effort being a taxi driver demands, Hilber feels very content with what he does.  He has always really liked driving, and he is able to work independently.\r\n\r\nAs if that weren't enough, Hilber and his wife are thinking about starting a restuarant to increase the possibility of improving their income.  The couple believes that anything is possible if they put forth a lot of interest and effort in the things that they do.  They believe they can accomplish their goals very soon.\r\n\r\nThis is Hilber's first loan with with MFP, and he decided to request it because he saw the improvements a loan had on his sister's business.  Hilber will use the money he is soliciting to refurbish his car so he can continue offering good service.  Additionally, he will buy clothes to support his wife so that she can improve her own business.

Previously, she sold costume jewelry, which was very profitable during certain times of the year, but Luz needed a more stable job so she started selling food.  Selling food has brought Luz a lot of gratification, because she has really good seasoning and every day she has more clients.\r\n\r\nLuz usually works during the mornings to deliver lunches to the people who order them since she does not have a restaurant where she can serve them.  Delivering food gives her the advantage of not having leftover food because she only cooks the number of plates people order.\r\n\r\nThis is Luz's sixth loan with MFP.  Her group is very good because all of the members are very responsible, making them one of the institution's exemplary groups.  With this loan, Luz will buy the ingredients needed to prepare her food as well as some kitchen utensils to help with her work.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":496302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Buying ingredients for food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T22:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":253.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":251.77},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":267.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":275.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":291.74},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":302.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":314.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":334.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":346.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":362.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.1},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.01},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.3},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.8,"local_amount":253.71,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":255.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993315,"comment":null},{"amount":88.12,"local_amount":251.77,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":253.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718098,"comment":null},{"amount":93.55,"local_amount":267.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":269.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751773,"comment":null},{"amount":96.58,"local_amount":275.92,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":277.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934235,"comment":null},{"amount":102.1,"local_amount":291.74,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":293.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673009,"comment":null},{"amount":105.82,"local_amount":302.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":304.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886804,"comment":null},{"amount":110.01,"local_amount":314.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":316.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153845,"comment":null},{"amount":116.98,"local_amount":334.21,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":336.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449244,"comment":null},{"amount":121.3,"local_amount":346.58,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":349.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182587984,"comment":null},{"amount":126.74,"local_amount":362.11,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":364.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724596,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T01:30:06Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":180468,"name":"Elton","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elton is a visionary and hard-working man.

She has small fields of corn, celery, leeks, etc. which she grows on he property's land.  Her vegetable stall is located in one of the most well-known markets in the area where she lives.  Previously, she sold her vegetables in the street, where she put them in plain view in open sacks that she spread out across the ground.  Thanks to one of her loans with MFP she was able to rent a stall in the market.  Now her products are more visible and she has more visits from customers.  Ninfa dedicates all morning to her business, later going home to prepare food, and in the afternoons she cares for her fields until dark.  Thanks to all this effort, Ninfa has been able to make a good income that help her support her household.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

Now she is borrowing her ninth loan for PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital in her multimedia services business.

She lives in her mother-in-law's house, along with her husband Fredy, age 25, and their beloved son Bryan, whom they hope to provide with a good education. \r\n\r\nLuzmila has always found the green fields of the village of Huaracayo a very agreeable place to work. Starting when she was very small, her parents taught her how to farm, and now she has her own land, which she cultivates with great dedication and sacrifice. \r\n\r\nWhat Luzmila likes most is growing peas and corn. She has been doing this work for 20 years, and she thinks the hardest part is transporting her crops to be sold in the city's market. Someday she hopes to open a small stall in the market herself, since she feels that she loses a lot by selling her products wholesale.\r\n \r\nThis is Luzmila's seventh loan with MFP. She knows she is responsible for making all of her payments on time, and she is ready to do so. Within her communal bank, she is always well-informed about the agreements made by her fellow members. With the five hundred Peruvian new soles she is requesting, she will buy pea seeds, since peas are currently selling very well at the market. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":496347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying pea seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":503.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886808,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T23:31:54Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":180499,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a 30-year-old father to a one-year-old child.

J. is a married woman who supports her family by operating a general store and selling rice. She lives in Brgy. Payao, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental with her husband Jonathan and their four children who are in school.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and rice retailing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000.\r\n\r\nJoyce is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she can maintain her general store and rice retailing business. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

S., 40, was widowed and this presented the greatest challenge of her life, as she had to take responsibility for her family and for the store that her husband left behind and that she could not keep going.\r\n\r\nMary, persistent in her work, managed to develop a workshop where she makes clothing and sells handicrafts to support her family.  Today her business is well recommended in the municipality of San Jacinto (in the Bolivar department) and this has made it possible for her 4 children, ages 22 to 30, to enter a profession.\r\n\r\nThis is the 5th loan that she has received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she is applying for a sum of $2,300 to buy fabrics to make school uniforms and to buy hammocks so that she can fulfill her orders.   She became a client of this organization in 2004, receiving a loan of $1,500 to increase her working capital.  This helped her to attract new customers and she has been gradually increasing her customer base up until the present.  With this business she was able to increase her economic resources and this has helped her so much in improving her business and also with the education of her children.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue to make progress in her business; she aspires to open a store once her children finish their studies, and later to have her own house, which she has not had since her husband died.<br

For the last three years she has sold assorted catalogue merchandise; she also sells articles that are not included in the catalogue.

Since her children were working and going to school, she was able to focus on selling to her acquaintances.  Then, she called upon Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, thanks to a recommendation from a neighbor, who gets loans from this organization.  She used the financing to increase her working capital and establish a credit history.  This, in turn, made it possible for several companies to offer her their products and she has been able to diversify the products she offers.\r\n\r\nHer dream for later on is to buy a public

Initially she worked with a friend who taught her the job, but later she took sewing classes and trained in the SENA how to embroider.  She enrolled in the Foundation in 2008 and has grown her business; she has another sewing machine and offers great customer service.  Her work has improved and she is very grateful for the loans she has received from the Foundation.  Even though she still has difficult moments when sales drop and her family income drops, luckily she works in a shop where she is paid by her own production.  Additionally, once when her husband was in an accident and she had to assume all household expenses, she was able to do it through her business.  Yenny and her husband don't own their home but they do own a piece of land which they purchased with their savings.  One of their goals is to build their own home and place her workshop in it.

His biggest challenge is meeting his obligations during periods of low sales but he has learned to manage his business very well and get through those times.\r\n\r\nHis most difficult time was when he changed work from farming to what we does now; he's still surprised at the risk he took, but he considers it part of his past and his dream now is to move forward and his happiness shows that he is doing so.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":496397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase aluminum, glass, accesories to make doors and windows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":126052},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":139095},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":141993},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":144951},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":147971},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":151054},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":154201},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":157413},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":160693},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":176577}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.24},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.23,"local_amount":126052,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":129789.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677871,"comment":null},{"amount":74.18,"local_amount":139095,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":143219.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712252,"comment":null},{"amount":75.73,"local_amount":141993,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":146203.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895752,"comment":null},{"amount":77.31,"local_amount":144951,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":149248.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636079,"comment":null},{"amount":78.92,"local_amount":147971,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":152358.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850177,"comment":null},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":151054,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":155532.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116943,"comment":null},{"amount":82.24,"local_amount":154201,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":158773.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410811,"comment":null},{"amount":83.95,"local_amount":157413,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":162080.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550468,"comment":null},{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":160693,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":165457.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688073,"comment":null},{"amount":94.17,"local_amount":176577,"processed_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":181812.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427319,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-01T22:52:04Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":180571,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don.

It was for this reason that CIDRE took the initiative to open an agency in this area and we discovered that the state in which they work has very difficult conditions because of the tropical climate and the 4-kilometer distance that he has to travel every day from his house to his farm. Because of this Mr. Teofilo will use this loan to buy a motorcycle and be able to dedicate more time to maintaining his farm and therefore with his family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Teofilo tells us that his biggest dream is to continue producing tropical fruits and increasing his crops and to be able to see his children and grandchildren have a better future and that one day he will have a well-established plantation in order to leave them an inheritance that helps them in life.

For the past few years, this has been her source of income. She is 44 years old and has two handsome sons. Her husband works in agriculture, and he provided her with the funds to get started with her work. Later, she chose to take out loans in order to invest more in her business and travel to the market. One of the difficulties she faces is that corn sometimes becomes expensive; she has to raise the price of her product, and her sales fall, throwing her business a little off balance. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy ingredients to continue preparing her products, such as corn, shortening, cane sweetener, cheese, sugar, and firewood, among others. She will also carry out repairs to her oven, since it currently needs maintenance; she has not built another one as she had earlier planned. Her goals include helping her sons complete their level of study and expanding her sales for greater profits. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Maria has 3 years of experience in this business.  Maria needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maria T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

ASHI is a microfinance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since then, she started selling ready-to-wear-clothes, which really helped to improve her family's standard of living. She is now seeking her fourth loan from ASHI, this time in the amount of 14,000 PHP ($325), to purchase additional inventory for her business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for blouses, shirts, sandals, jeans, short pants, and other supplies. She hopes that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA's field partners, she can reach her ambition to step out from poverty, expand her business, and pay for the needs of her two children in school. One of her dreams is to someday own their own house. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: ASHI has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen Bank's approach of providing credit to the poor people of the Philippines.

They always secure the land before planting and they sell all of their harvest.  For four years she has also been raising and selling cattle. According to her, this activity is profitable as well, since she brings the animals to market once a month in the area fairs.

She saw that there were no stores nearby, so she took advantage of this and opened her own store.  She started with a few items and has managed to stock it with many basic needs products over time.  This job is easy and she works by herself from six in the morning to six in the evening, although at times she extends her hours to meet her customer\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nShe also helps her husband with the farm work, but only during the harvest season because she does not have much free time between running the store and raising her children.  But since she is an enterprising woman, she plans to improve her store\u2019s fixtures in order to give it a better look and be able to improve her customer service.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan through MFP and she is grateful to all the people who make this loan possible and allow her to continue to work.  Edilisa will use the money from this loan to buy groceries in bulk to stock her store.

Z. is a 57-year-old hard working mother of eight children. Being a mother, her greatest achievement in life is graduating five of her children from college despite being poor. Now, only her three youngest children are living with her and her husband at home since her elder children have their own families. These three are still studying in high school and Helen wishes to support their education until college just like her elder children. Therefore, together with her husband, she decided to join ASHI and request a loan to finance the growth of their \u201cmuscovado\u201d sugar production.\r\n\r\n\u201cMuscovado\u201d sugar is an organic brown sugar made out of the sugar cane plant. Unlike the early years, the demand for this kind of sugar nowadays is higher because it is healthier and recommended even by doctors. Therefore, profits from this business could possibly increase. But they need a larger amount of capital to increase production and supply. For Helen to be able to comply with her business requirements and her children\u2019s needs, she is requesting a loan from Kiva through ASHI. Her proceeds will go to the education of her children once they are in college and to improve their standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":496905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

G. is a cheerful mother of four children whose ages range from one to 12 years old. She joined ASHI just recently because she wants to fulfill her dream of supporting the education of her children until they graduate from college. The loan she is requesting from Kiva through its partner organization in the Philippines, ASHI, will be used to purchase dried fish to sell. \r\n\r\nDried fish is the most common way to preserve fish, especially during harvest season where the supply is huge and the demand is low.
