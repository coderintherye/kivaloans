Tuzamurane Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annonciatha is 31 years old, married with 3 children; they are 1, 6, and 12 years old.  In addition, she takes care of one dependent from another family who is 16 years old.  Annonciatha lives in Nyarugenge, a region of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.  Here, Annonciatha is the president of a group called Tuzamurane.  This is the group's third successful year in the business of selling foodstuffs such as beans, potatoes, fish, soft drinks and produce.  The hours of their business require that they work from early in the morning until late in the evening depending upon customer traffic on any given day.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group seek to improve their businesses and to increase their sales using the capital from this loan.  This is their first loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company. With this loan, these members plan to carefully source and then purchase a greater quantity and variety of goods to sell.

With more products she will begin to improve her home in order to offer her family the protection and security that they deserve because the neighborhood they live in is not very safe.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":441458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-06T14:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.28,"local_amount":805.62,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":836.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003307,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":749.94,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":778.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841469,"comment":null},{"amount":43.78,"local_amount":875.57,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":908.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874389,"comment":null},{"amount":39.98,"local_amount":799.68,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":830.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604273,"comment":null},{"amount":39.37,"local_amount":787.47,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":817.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639738,"comment":null},{"amount":38.52,"local_amount":770.42,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":799.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821520,"comment":null},{"amount":39.77,"local_amount":795.3,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":825.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561526,"comment":null},{"amount":31.91,"local_amount":638.24,"processed_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":662.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770468,"comment":null},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.76,"processed_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":807.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204365,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T02:01:09Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":159416,"name":"Akinsola","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akinsola sells fresh tomatoes and pepper to make a living.

For several years she has worked for a Chinese company, but in the last few months everything has changed. She worries that they will close the plant because of the economic situation in the country. The reason she wants a loan is because her salary and that of her husband are not enough to be able to buy the material to build a sidewalk in front of their house.

She makes her home alone in a rented apartment as her husband has passed away and her children are grown.<P>\r\n\r\nVirginia is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza and she has big plans for her future. Prior to coming to work with Esperanza, Virginia worked as street sweeper earning RD$2,400 pesos a month (US$ 65) and she paid RD$1800 monthly for rent. She plans to use this loan to invest in her new business selling clothes that she will purchase (including pants, polo shirts, men's and women's shoes, watches, perfumes and soaps) in Santiago at a good price to a strong base of clients comprised of family, friends, and community members. (As a street sweeper she has come to know almost everyone in town.) She will use the profits to continue supporting herself and helping her children and grandchildren who often fall short of their basic necessities. At 65 she is still a dreamer and her long-term goal is to purchase a home and to open her own bakery so that she can work from home and spend more time with her grandchildren. She wants to thank you all for your support and to assure you that she neither drinks, nor smokes, nor plays the lottery and that with God's help she will pay your loan back!

Guzm\u00e1n V\u00eda, 20, is from a family that has scarce economic resources.  He recently formed a home with Mirley Minosca Guardia, who is now his wife.  Fernando works as a carpenter\u2019s helper.  His wife sells clothes in the Chimore market.\r\n\r\nFernando lives in the Naranjal area of the city of Cochabamba in a rented room with his wife.  They currently do not have their own house.  Because he does not have the guarantee of his own property or other things, it was hard for them to get a loan from other banks.  Only Cidre helped them by giving them a loan with lower interest.  The loan is to increase the capital in his wife\u2019s clothing sales.\r\n\r\nFernando Guzm\u00e1n V\u00eda tells us that his biggest desire is to have his own carpentry shop.  That way he would be able to have his own customers for his carpentry work.  In this manner he would save money.

The room is inadequate and uncomfortable for both him and his son, and the location is highly unsafe.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem Melvin has encountered in trying to better his personal and financial situation has been the lack of credit -- too few organizations support the marginalized and low-income sectors. \r\n\r\nOnce Melvin accomplishes his goal, he will move with his son to his new home, a new space where they will live comfortably and safely. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":441575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"Buying building materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-07T07:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melvin Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.29,"local_amount":905.8,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":940.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003314,"comment":null},{"amount":192.01,"local_amount":3840.23,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3986.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841476,"comment":null},{"amount":29.37,"local_amount":587.31,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":609.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821527,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":922.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561533,"comment":null},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":922.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770474,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.88,"processed_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":922.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204371,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-26T21:36:30Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":159467,"name":"Erma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Erma tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada con tres hijos, todos ellos ya mayores de edad y trabajan por cuenta propia.

ago, her children are married and live independently, our member mentions that she used to live in Machala but decided to relocate to Portoviejo because it's where her family is and she has her own house, in Machala she had a business of clothes sales and when she moved to Portoviejo she continued on with the same type of business which is located in the commercial area of the city, here she sets up her stand and displays merchandise like pants and underwear, she has worked on this activity for two years every day from Sunday to Sunday, it's tiring but she is not planning on changing anything.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Carmen has had six cycles as a member of the community bank, she's never had any problems and thanks to a friend she joined the Espoir foundation, she was able to supply her business and grow a little with the loans received.  The loan requested is to travel to Guayaquil and buy pants, blouses, jackets and underwear from distributors because in the last months of the year sales increase considerably.\r\n\r\nCarmen like the rest of the members has dreams and one of them is to be able to have her own store so that she doesn't have to set up a stand every day, which is difficult and bothersome, she mentions that soon all of the merchants will be relocated to a new area where they will have their own section, she would also like to have a car and be able to travel and buy better and more merchandise.<br

This bank has 20 members, and they meet in Angela's house.\r\n\r\nAngela is married and has a 10 year-old daughter.  Her husband works in the city of Quito; he comes to the house every 15 days.  She has a business buying and selling dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.  She started this business with the help of her father, from whom she learned the business.  She has been in this business for 8 years, which she carries out along with her studies.  Very soon, she will graduate from Ing. Comercial.  In addition, she works as a product promoter at events.\r\n\r\nAngela gets her supplies of cheese in the Cantonel market, and she orders her yogurt from the factories in Aloag in the Pichincha province.  Each week she buys two hundred pounds of cheese and 400 bottles of yogurt which she sells in the free market in a town one hour from Portoviejo.  She travels with her father and brother every Sunday very early to find a good spot in the market, and by 10am she is finished with her merchandise, because she has regular customers.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she requests she will buy a large order of dairy products, since in this season there is always a shortage of cheese due to low production, and she does not want her sales to be affected.  On a few occasions she has not been able to fill her orders of cheese for her customers.  For this reason Angela will travel to wholesalers to obtain sufficient supplies of her products.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Macor\u00eds, Dominican Republic. She is the coordinator for her group, Mujeres en Accion (Women in Action), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.<P>\r\n\r\nElixana lives with her father, husband, and three children (ages 4 to 7) in a small community north of San Pedro called Batey Euscarduna. Bateyes are poor rural communities that were built by sugar companies to house their field workers. Over time, the conditions in bateyes have deteriorated severely, with little to no access of potable water, electricity, or medical services. Despite these difficulties, Elixana operates a small food stand which focuses on fried foods. Some of the local favorites are johnnycakes and fried salami. <P>\r\n\r\nElixana is very grateful for this loan, her fifth with Esperanza International. Since receiving loans, her travel time to purchase inventory has dropped drastically. Elixana used to have to travel often to buy supplies, but now she has enough cash flow to purchase a bulk supply that will last her a long time. Her loans have also helped her support her children, and Elixana hopes to send them to college so they can move up in society. Thank you for supporting Elixana and the Mujeres en Accion

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lotufou joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lotufou's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from secondary\/high-school.

planting & harvesting taro, yams and bananas.  She has 12 years of experience in this business.    Lea needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lea's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.  \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from secondary\/high-school.

She has many years of experience in this business.    Lelei needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lelei joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lelei's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.  \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from secondary\/high-school.

Their home is in a batey; bateyes are poor rural communities built by Dominican sugar companies to house their field workers. Over the years, conditions in bateyes have drastically deteriorated, and they now have very little access to electricity, potable water, or medical services. Despite these difficulties (and a full house!), Altagracia runs a successful miscellaneous store from her home. With this loan, her fifth with Esperanza International, she will purchase foods (oil, flour, chicken, and coffee), clothing, shoes, and gasoline. Altagracia will then sell these items at a small markup to her neighbors and community.<P>\r\n\r\nAltagracia is very proud of her business\u2019 success. She has slowly but surely increased her inventories and seen her profits rise. One of Altagracia\u2019s sons is currently studying at the university in San Pedro, and she hopes that the rest of her children will also have that opportunity. With additional profits, Altagracia hopes to soon buy a display for the food that she sells. This will make her items more attractive to her customers and bring in more business.

The members of Munay Tika work in various locales in the sacred valley. Some sell their goods in Urubamba, while others work in Oyallantaytambo, a small town twenty minutes from Urubamba where many tourists catch the train to Machu Picchu.\n\nEmiliano, a member of the group, owns a small grocery store but also holds a job in construction. He is 45-years old, married, and has four children. Emiliano now lives with his family in Urubamba, but was born in the region of Quillabamba.

Bi-ao, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nNilda already had a general store before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997, but she was able to expand her operations by selling her products in the nearby school, earning more income from a bigger customer base. She even expanded to selling food, and this has become a stable source of income, earning about 19,800 PHP per month. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP was well utilized as working capital for her general store and now she is borrowing the same amount to continue sustaining the business momentum of her general store and food vending business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieve realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" --  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":441150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

R., 61, is the matriarch of her family. It is her most cherished dream to help her grandchildren have wider opportunities in the future. She is married to Renaldo, who works as a driver and also helps her run their business.

Su-ay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996, because she realized that her husband's income was not enough to support their family's needs. With the loans from NWTF-PD, she went into the food vending business, selling a variety of native delicacies around her neighborhood and in the nearby villages.

She is married to Vergilio, 54 years old, a driver.\r\n<p>\r\nThe income of her husband is not enough to meet the needs of their family. There came an opportunity to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in the year 2005. She was given hope and opportunity to have access to capital, so she started her sari-sari store (a small retail store for different goods). This simple business brings them good income. Currently on her fifth loan, she requests 15,000 Philippine pesos as additional capital to purchase more stock to meet the demands of her consumers.\r\n<p>\r\nGina hopes that, with ASHI and Kiva lending a hand, she can fulfill her dreams in life: sending her only child to school until she finds a job and improving her business. She even plans to expand her sari-sari store into a grocery store (a big store supplying all the needs of her consumers). She also hopes for a comfortable house to live in and a happy family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":442565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has been in this line of work for 15 years and feels that the hardest part of the job is withstanding the intense cold common in the mornings when she opens up for business.  For later in the future, she would like to enlarge her store so that she can offer better customer service.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is very happy to have gotten it.  She knows that she must invest the money in her business so that it will be more productive.  She is a very active member of her communal bank.  The two-thousand soles requested will be used to buy items to better stock her store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":442616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy stock items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-06T22:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":334.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734880,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":334.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124204,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":334.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959943,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":334.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992790,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":334.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717579,"comment":null},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":336.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751254,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-13T17:20:17Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":159691,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 25 years old and married with a four-year-old daughter named Linet.

With the two thousand new soles she has requested, she will buy more cosmetics in order to better stock her stand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":442797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase inventory of merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-07T02:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":334.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734889,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":334.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124213,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":334.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959952,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":334.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992799,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":334.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717588,"comment":null},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":336.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751263,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T10:53:28Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":159705,"name":"Perla's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perla O. is from the village of La Paz, Cabatuan, Isabela.

P. is from the village of Cabanglasan, Bukidnon. She is 47 years old. Perlita is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Perlita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Perlita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Perlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Perlita is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Perlita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:<p>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

He lives in a rented house with his family and his greatest desire is to get ahead in life.  His auto mechanic shop is one of the busiest in town because the cars come out well repaired after the rigorous repairs he provides.  He learned this skill at an early age because he has worked in other shops before which has made him highly skilled in car repair.  What he likes the most about his work is making the cars be like new since he puts in a lot of effort to repair them.  He has been in this line of work for 10 years and considers the most difficult part of it to be lugging the heavy replacement parts that he has to place in some cars.  For later on, he hopes to open a shop in a more centrally-located site in the city because his current shop is far.  This is Roberto's first loan with MFP and he wants to repay it without delay because he wants to have access to future loans.  With the fifteen-hundred new soles requested he will buy new replacement parts to better repair cars.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

A. is from the city of Linao Norte Tuguegarao, City.

Teresita has been engaged in her business for over twenty years and earns approximately $112  a month as her net income from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 10th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Emerita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emerita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Emerita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the town of Turod Norte, Cordon. She is 55 years old. Glorita is widowed and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Glorita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector selling charcoal. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling charcoals to their community. Glorita earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Glorita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Glorita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional charcoals to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Glorita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":442900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

is a 39-year-old single mother of four children between the ages of 11 and 17.  All her children go to school. She rents a one-room house where she lives with five people. Kasifa takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity and gets three meals a day, but has no piped water. She incurs transportation costs to and from shopping in Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala city. \r\n<p>\r\nKasifa has a retail shop in Natete and sells all types of goods like salt, sugar, flour and soap. She pays rent of about $27 a month for her business premises and about $16 a month for her residence. She works in a semi-urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of twenty customers a day and sells to all categories of people.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer largest monthly expenses include feeding the family, school fees for her children and monthly rent for her business and her residence. Her major business challenges are seasonality and the rainy season which hinders her customers from reaching her.\r\n<p>\r\nKasifa has been in this business for four years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her 10th loan and working with the same group mates. Kasifa joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more merchandise, like bags of sugar, cartons of salt and boxes of soap. She wants to see her business grow bigger and would like to start selling on a wholesale basis only.

R. is from the town of Turod Norte Cordon. She is 55 years old, widowed and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Melba owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Melba has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 4000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Melba joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Melba is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Melba from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is 41 years old. She is married with seven children between the ages of 15 and 19 years. None of her children go to school because she couldn\u2019t raise school fees. She owns a four-room house, where she is staying with six people. Rehema takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity, gets three meals a day, but do not have piped water. \r\n\r\nRehema has a stall selling fresh foods in Nakulabye. She incurs transport costs to and from buying her fresh food, such as sacks of bananas, sweet potatoes, cassava, onions and tomatoes. She works seven days a week in a semi urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She receives an average of 20 customers a day and sells to all categories of people both on the retail and wholesale markets. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding her family, school fees for her children and monthly market dues. Her major business challenge is the rainy season which hinders her from reaching her customers. She has been in this business for ten years and with MCDT for five years. Rehema is servicing her tenth loan and working with the same groupmates. Rehema joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of banana, sacks of cassava, boxes of tomatoes and onions. She would like to see her business grower bigger and to be able to sell only on the wholesale market.

is a 29-year-old married woman with one child aged 10 years. Her child goes to school. She resides in and rents a two-roomed house where she lives with three people. She also takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity but no piped water and gets three meals a day. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family, school fees for her child and the monthly rent of her residence.\r\n\r\nHamida works seven days a week in a semi-urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She fries chapati (an unleavened flatbread, similar to tortillas) and samosas (fried or baked triangular-shaped pastry shells with a savory filling) in Kawempe Kalule Zone. She receives an average of twenty customers a day and sells to all categories of people both retail and wholesale. She incurs transport costs to and from buying baking flour and cooking oil for making chapati and samosas. Her major business challenges are seasonality and the rainy season which hinders her from reaching her customers.\r\n\r\nHamida has been in this business for five years and with MCDT for seven years and is servicing her nineteenth loan. Hamida joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more cartons of baking flour and a jerrycan of cooking oil.. She wants to see her business  grower bigger and to start selling wholesale only.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":274.37,"image":{"id":443001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Two of the children are married and live outside the family home, another two are garment factory workers, three attend school and the other one stays at home.\r\n\r\nBunthoeun has been driving a motor taxi for more than ten years, while his wife is a cleaner for a company. Unhappily, a thief stole his motorbike so that Bunthoeun is not able to continue his business. Facing this, he decides to request his first loan of $1,000 to buy a new motorbike in order to continue his business.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for him to find a proper place to keep things in the open-air space on the ground beneath his house, and things there are exposed to the elements. Therefore, he will use a part of the loan to build a concrete and brick room under his wooden house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":443037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Leonides has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2,800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leonides joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and give her the ability to engage in business activities. Leonides has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Leonides is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Leonides from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Aida is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":443086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 46 years old. Joel is the group leader of a 15-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJoel is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Joel runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Joel has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joel is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Joel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":443127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
