Kiva borrower is a 38-year-old married man from Lebanon.

With his experience, he has been able to gain a good number of clients asking for his reparation services. He works hard, as he is the only family provider, to support the heavy expenses of his life and to pay for his children's schooling. He plans to make some modifications and expand his shop and to do so, he is asking to borrow $1000 from Kiva's partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy additional tools.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans with Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

She wants to start raising hogs so she would have an extra source of income. \r\n\r\nIsabel joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Isabel has successfully repaid a previous loan  from CEVI. Isabel is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. She also plans to buy piglets to raise. This will be the eleventh loan taken out by Isabel from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":581116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase materials for laundry and buy piglets to raise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Panglao, Bohol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 123.783333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2010-08-09T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6287.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166827706,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3143.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172094020,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T10:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3143.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177385898,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3143.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523950,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-11T03:41:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:38:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221164,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria A.

Este es su cuarto cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n y solicita su credikiva por valor de $1.000.000 COP,  para comprar cerdos para la cr\u00eda, engorde y venta de su carne y tambi\u00e9n,  adquirir en mayor volumen materias primas e insumos, para la preparaci\u00f3n de los almuerzos que vende.\nCon sus cr\u00e9ditos ha conseguido aumentar sus utilidades y con ello comprar un carro que utiliza  para  el negocio.

Ben\u00edtez came from El Carmen de Bol\u00edvar to Barranquilla with her spouse and three children seeking peace and economic stability.  At first they arrived at a relative\u2019s who helped them out.  Later, when her husband got a job as a watchman at a towing site, they moved.  In time, her husband\u2019s boss gave them a room that they gradually enlarged and they started their business of raising animals to sell their meat.  Today, they are in this line of work and they butcher 60 pigs.  Luz Mar\u00eda is in charge of this particular task while her husband works at a saw mill where she secured the business of preparing daily lunches there for 35 employees and daily her business grows.\r\n\r\nThis is the 4th loan with the Foundation and she\u2019s asking for a Kiva loan in the amount of $1.000.000 COP to buy pigs to raise for subsequent pork sales as well as to acquire larger amounts of raw materials and ingredients to prepare the lunches she sells.\r\n\r\nThe loans have made it possible for her to increase profits and buy a car that she uses in the business.  Her dream is focused on buying a house and this is the great challenge she faces: the constant need to save in order to reach it.\r\n\r\nHowever, she  learned how to overcome her challenges since she arrived in Barranquilla with only the wish to get ahead, pushed by the need to provide security and wellbeing for her children who were then little.  Currently, they are studying and well organized.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She will have this semi-annual loan until the end of her course of study; it is an opportunity to have her matriculation covered from semester to semester until she earns her professional degree.

A. is always busy doing something productive, because she moves easily from one activity to another, and this is part of her daily routine. She has several businesses: she runs an Internet caf\u00e9, where she offers telecommunications services and also rents washing machines; she has a display case where she sells merchandise; and if that weren't enough, she prepares fried foods, skewers, \"fingers\" and little empanadas, and she also makes the most delicious fruit-flavored ice creams in her neighborhood, which is located near La Playa. \n\nRecently, two of her washing machines have been malfunctioning. She needs to repair them, and she also needs to replace the tables in her Internet caf\u00e9. However, at the same time, she needs to prepare herself with enough new merchandise to sell, especially for Valentine's Day and Friendship Day, which is coming up soon. For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP to achieve this. \n\nHer entrepreneurial career began 10 years ago, when a Sister of Charity in a religious community, the director of a school, suggested that she organize an associative group to prepare preserved food in the township of La Playa. Thus, with other neighbors, she received technical training in food preparation and also came to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation for technical advice in standardizing and diversifying their products. They also learned how to manage their business administratively, in order to gain access to loans. This business went very well, but Elsie found that the heat caused her many health problems, and she had to abandon this work and look for other alternatives. Thus, some 5 years later, she was preparing preserved foods and ice cream in her own home, and three years after that, she applied for an individual loan from the Foundation to buy washing machines. Through her work and with the help of 6 loans, she has been able to set up a shop in her home and has added other services such as the Internet caf\u00e9, which now has 2 more computers and generates work not only for Elsie herself, but also for a niece and her husband. The latter helps her with the transportation of the washing machines, because he works independently in a field that is highly seasonal, and much of the time he has to wait around for opportunities to work. \n\nElsie has two sons; one is a systems engineer, and the other is studying to become a culinary technician. She affirms that her family is very united, and because of this, with hard work and great efforts, they have been able to get ahead. However, she still remembers the first impetus given to her by Sister Ol\u00ec, the nun at the church, who brought her into contact with the Foundation, and she appreciates this very much. \n\nHer goal now is to officially register her business and expand it, but she is currently facing the challenge of finding an Internet provider that offers her better service than her current one. Elsie is pictured in her Internet cafe.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

Kiva borrower is a 44-year-old married man from Lebanon.

In addition to selling his products from his shop, he also works as a traveling salesman. His story illustrates, on a day-to-day basis, the challenges facing Lebanese fathers in trying to satisfy their families\u2019 needs. They always try to find new opportunities to earn income.\r\n\r\nToday, he is requesting to borrow $1,200 to increase his store inventory to stock up before the coming holidays in Lebanon.

Kiva borrower is a 46-year-old married man and father of 2 children from Lebanon. He has owned a shoe and bag factory in his town since 1985. He produces women's shoes only. He always tries to produce the new trends and collections for his customers and he also works on request of his clients. \r\n\r\nHe is well known in this field due to the long period of operation and his experience; he distributes his products to different shoe shops all over Lebanon. And he is thankful for his business income. Today, he is requesting to borrow US$ 1200 to perform maintenance needed for his machinery and to buy supplies.

Nora, inici\u00f3 sus labores agr\u00edcolas desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, junto a su esposo, a quien le gusta sembrar arveja, gladiolo, papa y ma\u00edz sobre los terrenos de sus suegros. Paralelamente a este trabajo, tambi\u00e9n cr\u00eda animales, sea: ovino, porcino y reses; que los venden cuando necesitan algo de dinero para cubrir alg\u00fan percance. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a ella es sembrar papa, pues que solo consiste esparcir las semillas en los surcos y esperar que sean cubiertos por la persona que aran la tierra. Por otro lado le es dificultoso cosechar arveja y papa, porque es cansado y pesado, pues necesita estar agachada por mucho tiempo para sacar los productos ya maduros y eso le provoca dolor de cintura. Sin embargo manifiesta que vale la pena porque las ganancias que obtiene son rentables. Por tal motivo, planea instalar una florer\u00eda en la ciudad de Huancayo, aprovechando que sus familiares le han cedido una casa en dicha ciudad. Este es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y esta feliz de seguir trabajando con los integrantes de su grupo comunal, por ser organizados y solidarios. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, piensa invertir en la compra de semilla de arveja y varios sacos de abono org\u00e1nico, para sembrarlos.\n\n","en":"Nora is 43 years old and married to Percy, age 30.  They live at her parents\u2019 house so that she can take care of them since they are elderly.  As of this date, they are not able to have children.  She began farming with her husband six years ago.  Nora enjoys planting peas, gladiolas, potatoes, and corn on land owned by her in-laws.  In addition to this work, she also raises animals such as sheep, pigs, and cattle.  She sells the animals whenever money is needed to cover an emergency.  What she enjoys most is planting potatoes.  These seedlings must be spread out in furrows and covered by the person who prepared the soil.  On the other hand, she finds harvesting her potato and pea crops difficult because the work is tiring and the loads can get heavy.  She spends a lot of time hunched over gathering the crops that have matured, thereby causing her back pain.  Nonetheless, she says the effort is worth it since her crops generate profitable earnings.  Nora plans to open a floral shop in the city of Huancayo since she has taken advantage of a house in that area that was given to her by her relatives.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Nora is happy to continue working with the members of her Communal Bank since they are organized and work well with one another.  The loan she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of seeds for planting peas and several sacks of organic fertilizer.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":581311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase seeds for planting peas & sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-15T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326885,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T15:40:14Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221259,"name":"Strong Brothers #1.

They live in a cosy house that they own, located in the Peruvian mountain range called \u201cPatay\u201d. He does not want to leave his parents, nor the land where he was born. This is why the teachings given by his parents about farming, have helped him in his farming business. He has been sowing peas and flowers such as gladiolus for 5 years now, and he considers it to be profitable, as it is allowing him to finish studying for a professional career, as a nurse, and he can also cover the family's expenses. He enjoys the business that he is in, and to speed up his farming work he contracts workers, as he does not have any family help.

En esta \u00faltima campa\u00f1a de cosecha, llev\u00f3 su producci\u00f3n al mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Lima, logrando ganar mayores ingresos econ\u00f3micos.

For 18 years she has grown peas, potatoes, gladioli and maize on the land she owns, counting on the help of her husband. Parallel to this she has also raised horses and donkeys, who help her to transport her products and tools to the land where she works during the day. Yolanda likes growing peas and gladioli because they are the products in greatest demand in the market, particularly during festival times. Without question it's difficult for Yolanda to have to transport what she harvests and to pay for the transport, but she knows that her profits depend on this. In the most recent harvest season Yolanda took her product to the wholesale market in Lima where she received better economic returns. In the future Yolanda wants to grow peas in a larger quantity and install a food sale business in her house. This is her second loan with MFP, and she is happy to continue working with the members of her communal bank as they know her working methodology which she likes very much. With the loan she is seeking Yolanda thinks to invest in the purchase of 2 bags of pea seeds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":581353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase pea seeds ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326888,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-10T13:40:39Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221286,"name":"Jorge Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge de 24 a\u00f1os, vive en Primavera de Duran ( zona periurbana, con una ecolog\u00eda en disoluci\u00f3n a las afuera de Guayaquil), trabaja como servicio al cliente en la ma\u00f1ana y tarde, pero en las noches se dedica a vender comida para tener oto ingreso adicional. \n\nDespu\u00e9s de llegar de su trabajo de servicio al clientes, el va a cocinar en su casa para vender en la noche hamburguesa, papas con pollo frito y colas.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seeds and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\n\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He usually raises small animals (poultry, sheep) which he sells to the dealers who come to the area where he lives or also in a fair that takes place once a week in the district of Cayalt\u00ed (an hour away).\r\n\r\nLuis Alberto wants to improve the feed he gives to his animals so that they develop better and can be sold at a better price.

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from Patan BPW, which she used to increase the investment in her agriculture business. In the future, Krishna Kumari plans to increase her income from agriculture. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He lives in his own house, together with his wife Orfelinda, age 17, and his beloved daughter  Mar\u00eda, 5 months. He would like to provide both of them with a better quality of life. Throughout Luis' life, he has had to work in the fields to survive. Since he was very young, his parents taught him how to work on the farm, and for this reason he decided to continue in the family profession. He now has his own fields, where he grows coffee and bananas. Once his crops are harvested, he takes them to sell at the market in the city of La Merced. He has done this work for 10 years, and he continues to enjoy planting, since he knows that his family's well-being depends on his work. What he considers most difficult is protecting his crops from abrupt changes in the weather, since these greatly affect his productivity. In the future, he hopes to continue working hard and improving his crops. This is his third loan with MFP, and he knows that it will be very beneficial for the development of his farm. Within his communal bank, he is known as a very responsible member, and thus he is highly respected. With the two thousand Peruvian new soles he is requesting, he will buy fertilizer to improve his crops. \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":581497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying more fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269265,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-14T07:48:51Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221359,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan es un padre de familia de 33 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposa y a sus dos hijos en el sector La Delicias del distrito de Oyot\u00fan, una zona agr\u00edcola ubicada a mas de dos horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo, se caracteriza por tener tierras f\u00e9rtiles y geograf\u00eda accidentada, dada su cercan\u00eda a la sierra norte del pa\u00eds.\n\nSe dedica a trabajar en crianza y venta de animales desde hace mas de diez a\u00f1os, el suele criar aves de corral como patos y gallinas en un ambiente ubicado en la parte posterior de su domicilio, cuando estas ya han alcanzado un buen nivel de desarrollo las ofrece en venta a los negociantes que suelen frecuentar la zona o las vende en una feria que toma lugar una vez por semana en el distrito de Cayalti ( a una hora de donde vive).\n\nJuan desea ampliar su negocio comprando mas aves de corral y alimento balanceado de modo que puedan desarrollarse de mejor manera y por consiguiente ser vendidas a mejor precio, para lograr su meta ha solicitado por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles.\n\nJuan es una persona tranquila y responsable, su mayor anhelo es brindarle a su familia la oportunidad de tener una mejor calidad de vida, para lograrlo trabaja arduamente todos los dias.

She is married and has 3 children aged 20, 14 and 10.  In 2000, she established  her agriculture business.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she supports her family.  In the future, Seti Maya plans to earn more in farming.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

is 36-year-old Bishnu L..  She is married and has 3 children aged 14, 10 and 8.  In 2001, she established  her service business.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase vegetables from others to sell.  In the future, Bishnu plans to earn more in vegetable business.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

H\u00e0 is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Nghi\u00eam X\u00e1 Nh\u00f3m 14 (Nh\u00f3m 14).\r\n\r\nH\u00e0 is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, H\u00e0 owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale.  H\u00e0 has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,800,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H\u00e0 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u00e0 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby pigs to raise and sell in the future.  \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by her from SEDA.  H\u00e0 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb L.

To make a living, H. owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,200,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,600,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase feed and other supplies.\r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise and sell in future.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by her from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n<b>About SEDA:<\/b>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The reason she is asking for this loan is they plan to finish the internal decorations and to move in to their newly built house before winter comes. \r\n\r\nNarangerel used to work in a clothing factory and was left jobless because the factory closed down. Then she started her own tailoring business and employs two tailors, paying them 150,000 Mongolian tugrug (MNT) a month each. She makes protective clothing such as gloves and overalls and sells them in the market. She rents two stalls in \"Harhorin\" the second largest market in Ulaanbaatar city and sells garments as well.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

Deborah is 18 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.   Deborah has a drugstore (pharmacy), which she has had for three years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Deborah has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more medicine.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Deborah hopes to generate greater profits and to take care of herself by buying food and clothes for herself.  In the future, Debora hopes to own a house.              \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva, which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

Faridah is 20 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.  She is married and has two children.  One of her children is currently in school.  Faridah has had a business selling food like matooke for three years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Faridah has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase charcoal and more food.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Faridah hopes to generate greater profits and to buy food and clothes.  In the future, Faridah hopes to own a vehicle, a house, and to educate her child.    \r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva, which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":581674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Margret is 19 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children Margret has had a business selling food like matooke and sweet potatoes for two years.  \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margret has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more food.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Margret hopes to generate greater profits, sometimes to buy food and to take care of herself.  In the future, Margret hopes to own a house.    \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva, which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":581678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Rose has a business of a restaurant, which she has had for two years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase a fridge to sell cold drinks. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Rose hopes to generate greater profits and to educate her young sister. In the future, Rose hopes to own a house and to have a good life.   \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":581690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

Grace is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.   Grace has a business of selling charcoal, which she has had for three years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more charcoal to sell.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Grace hopes to generate greater profits in order to help buy food at home and pay school fees.  In the future, Grace hopes to study up to the university level.       \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":581707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":581711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Anesia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Anesia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients needed & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Anesia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":581719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase additional ingredients needed & provide working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sugbongcogon, Misamis Oriental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anesia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2253.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166858923,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1802.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172125151,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1802.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177418946,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2253.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182558025,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":901.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188694260,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-12T16:04:01Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:21:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221483,"name":"Chuluunbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chuluunbat is 42 years old and lives with his wife and their 2 children and 3 grandchildren in his own ger, a  traditional Mongolian nomadic tent.

S. is from the village of Sta. Cruz, Benito Soliven. He is 32 years old. Saturnino is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Saturnino owns & operates a business venture in the transportation sector providing motorcycle transportation. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle transportation to the local community. Saturnino has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately 7500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Saturnino joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Saturnino has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase motorcycle wheels. Saturnino is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to maintain his motorcyle. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Saturnino from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Flavia is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is married and has 2 children.  One of her children is currently in school.  Flavia has a business in raising poultry, which she has done for 8 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Flavia has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more chickens.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Flavia hopes to generate greater profits and have a good life.  In the future, Flavia hopes to own a house.   \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

Vinh is the leader of a 5-member group - officially called 080805-Hoang thinh - that is requesting a loan from the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each group member receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nVinh is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To making a living, she operates a family business in the agriculture sector, raising livestock, particularly chickens, for sale. Vinh has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 600,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Vinh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Vinh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,124,000 VND from the Fund, which she used to purchase livestock for breeding.  Now, she is requesting a new loan of 1,062,000 VND, which will be used for the same purpose, and which will be her 9th loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Vinh plans to use the additional revenue to further improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the group's other borrowers:\r\n\r\n1.  L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Y\u1ebfn, 38, is requesting a loan of 3,079,800 VND to support her livestock-breeding business.\r\n\r\n2.  N. Th\u1ecb L\u00fd, 29, is requesting a loan of 2,442,600 VND for her livestock-breeding business.\r\n\r\n3.  H. Th\u1ecb H\u1ea3i, 55, is requesting a loan of 2,124,000 VND to support her livestock business.\r\n\r\n4.  L\u00ea D. Ni\u00ean, 29, is requesting a loan of 2,124,000 VND for her livestock business.\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Norah wants to improve on the status quo of her family with the acquisition of this loan, as she wants to give this business an improved lease on life in terms of expansion, through restocking her shop with a vision of making it a wholesale business, and thus earning more sales revenue.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":579442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more stock like soap, sugar, salt, cooking oil, books etc. for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esau","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Innocent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovanis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Quaraish","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yorokamu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geresome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Living","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7600000,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1266666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1266666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":556.3,"local_amount":1216665,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1222756.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903719,"comment":null},{"amount":528.32,"local_amount":1155469,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1161253.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297185,"comment":null},{"amount":565.07,"local_amount":1235832,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1242019.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467460,"comment":null},{"amount":539.75,"local_amount":1180467,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1186377.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605550,"comment":null},{"amount":707.3,"local_amount":1546902,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1554646.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744673,"comment":null},{"amount":578.26,"local_amount":1264665,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1270996.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482862,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T04:22:01Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:08:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221524,"name":"Enyonam","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A. exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce de produits cosm\u00e9tiques, elle fait ce commerce depuis plus de 4 ans et ma\u00eetrise le contour de cette activit\u00e9. elle fait son commerce au march\u00e9 local d'ago\u00e8 atsanv\u00e9. son stock de marchandises est en baisse. elle sollicite de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit pour l'achat de 4 cartons de m\u00e8ches amina, des perruques et divers produits de beaut\u00e9.","en":"Mrs. A. makes money running a shop selling cosmetic products.

A. is a successful father and dedicated husband. He has 4 children, the elder is studying at University and his youngest is still in elementary school. Khairidin began a small grocery store 5 years ago with his savings. He was assisted by his wife, who helps him to serve his clients. Today his clientele has grown greater and his grocery store has become more popular. He is asking for a loan so that he may expand the variety of goods that are sold in his store. Khairidin is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve success in his business with this loan.       \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
