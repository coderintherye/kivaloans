Three of her children are already grown up and are no longer dependent on her. She has always lived in Hind\u00e9 1, the district surrounding Dantokpa market. For about twenty years she has run a business selling condiments and various food products. In 2007 she took out an initial loan of 40,000 CFA Francs ($100) in order to increase her capital and make her display more attractive.  This loan proved to be a great support as her business underwent a considerable improvement.

She is married to Mr. Gabriel DEGBOGBAHOUN, a retired soldier, and is mother to five children. She does catering at the Suru-L\u00e9r\u00e9 School of General Education. In March 2004 she requested and was granted a first loan of 30,000 CFA Francs ($75) so that she could offer her clientele, made up mostly of pupils from the Suru-L\u00e9r\u00e9 school,  a varied and sufficiently well-balanced daily menu.  This experience proved very beneficial as, within a year, her working capital went from 50,000 CFA Francs ($125) to 85,000 CFA Francs ($210).  Other loans followed this first one. The only detriment to her career as a female entrepreneur has been her health, which was a little fragile in 2006, the year when she received a loan of 70,000 CFA Francs ($175). Her health has since improved and her business has returned to normal. She is therefore requesting her seventh loan to better position herself. \r\n Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer.\r\nNative de LOKOSSA dans le d\u00e9partement du Mono au sud est du B\u00e9nin, dame G.

They live in traditional families with their husbands, generally their husbands\u2019 other wives, and their children in Djinina, a village in the Fana subprefecture, Dioila prefecture, Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali. They all have small businesses that consist of selling food items, clothing, charcoal, fruits and vegetables, etc. They are primarily united by the fact that they live in the same village. Benkadi has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for four years and has obtained eight group loans which were all repaid in full. The group members who sell charcoal generally buy it in other villages and then sell it for cash on market days to business clients from Bamako or S\u00e9gou. The other women buy their condiments in Fana and then sell them retail in the village. With this loan, the women of the Benkadi group from Djinina, Fana hope to each earn a monthly profit of 10,000 CFA francs, which will be mostly used to pay off the interest on the loan and resolve some financial problems. The rest will be used for capital.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLes membres du groupe Benkadi sont des femmes mari\u00e9es ayant une moyenne d\u2019age de 35 ans et 5 enfants qui vivent dans de familles traditionnelles avec leurs maris, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement avec co\u00e9pouses et des enfants dans le village de Djinina, un des villages de la sous pr\u00e9fecture de Fana, Pr\u00e9fecture de Dioila, R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro, R\u00e9publique du Mali.\r\nElles exercent toutes le petit commerce : de denr\u00e9es alimentaires, d\u2019habillements, de charbon de bois, de fruits et l\u00e9gumes etc. Elles sont essentiellement li\u00e9es par des relations de voisinage.

They live in polygamous families with their husbands, their husbands\u2019 other wives, and their children in the village of Sikouna 2, in the subprefecture of Fana (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali). Their business consists of selling charcoal, which they buy in neighboring villages from men who are specialized in producing charcoal. They have a place to store the charcoal in front of their family homes and generally sell it retail to a diverse clientele (men and women) and wholesale to people who have market stands in big cities like S\u00e9gou Fana and Bamako. Brought together by the fact that they are in the same trade, live in the same village and are each experienced in business, the members of the group were faced with a lack of capital. After much discussion, they decided to join Soro Yiriwaso, from which they are receiving their first group loan. With this loan, they intend to buy an average of 15 bags of charcoal each (1,000 CFA francs per bag). Each bag will then be sold for 1,500 CFA francs, generating a weekly profit of 7,500 CFA francs. This profit will help them pay off the interest on the loan and meet their families\u2019 needs and will above all help them to develop their business.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLes membres du groupe Benkadi 4 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es ayant une moyenne d\u2019age de 23 ans et 4 enfants.

They live in polygamous families with their husbands, their husbands\u2019 other wives, and their children in the village of Sikouna 2 (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali). Their business consists of selling charcoal, which they buy from farmers who have licenses to cut down trees and produce charcoal. They have a place to store the charcoal in their family homes and generally sell it retail to a diverse clientele (men and women) and wholesale to people who have market stands in big cities like S\u00e9gou Fana and Bamako. Brought together by the fact that they are in the same trade, live in the same village and are each experienced in business, the members of the group decided that in order to generate additional income, they would join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from which they are receiving their first group loan. With this loan, they intend to buy an average of 25 bags of charcoal each (1,000 CFA francs per bag). Each bag will then be sold for 1,500 CFA francs, generating a weekly profit of 12,500 CFA francs. This profit will help pay off the interest on the loan and will above all help them to develop their business.

They live in Fana-coura, one of the neighborhoods of the city of Fana, in the Koulikoro Region of Mali, and they have polygamous families with husbands, co-wives, and children. They make non-alcoholic beverages (fruit juices, powdered juice, juice made from dah (dried hibiscus leaves), and juice made with ginger). Due to a mutual trust for one another, and being united by work relationships and friendship, the four women of the Djiguitougou group have been in collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso for two years. The women have taken out four loans which they have repaid in full. They stock up on raw materials at the central market in Fana (wild fruits, powdered juice, packs of small plastic bags, dah (dried hibiscus leaves), ginger, colorings, and flavorings). The juices are made daily, generally at night, put into bags, and refrigerated before being sold in the morning at the market, in the schools, or at the houses of loyal and regular customers.

Brought together through neighborhood ties and friendship, they have been working with Soro Yiriwaso for one year and are on their third group loan. All previous loans were repaid without problem. They stock up on raw materials in Konobougou on market days, buying spices from wholesalers from S\u00e9gou and incense primarily from wholesalers from Bamako.  They sell at the same market in Konobougou, either at stalls or by walking around, and do this throughout the year. Their customers are women who sell to neighboring villages or women from Konobougou. The group plans to buy 15 kg of spices (pepper, abutilon, laurel, etc.) at CFA 2,000\/kg to sell at CFA 2,500\/kg, hence a weekly profit of CFA 7,500, and incense ingredients (2 kg of magnonkis\u00e8ni, 5 kg of gueni, and 4 bottles of perfume) at a cost of CFA 25,000, which would yield a profit of CFA 30,000 per month. Each member of the group hopes to make a monthly profit of CFA 30,000 with which they will pay the loan interest and increase their capital. \r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\nLes femmes du groupe Djiguiseme sont \u00e0 majorit\u00e9 mari\u00e9es avec une moyenne d\u2019age de 30 ans et 4 enfants .Elles vivent dans des familles traditionnelles avec leurs maris, co\u00e9pouses et enfants dans le village de Konobougou pr\u00e9fecture de Baroueli (R\u00e9gion de S\u00e9gou    R\u00e9publique du Mali)\r\nElles font essentiellement le commerce de : condiments alimentaires et des produits de beaut\u00e9 traditionnelles (encenses etc.) \r\nUnies par des liens de voisinage et d\u2019amiti\u00e9 elles collaborent avec Soro Yiriwaso depuis une ann\u00e9e et sont \u00e0 leur troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat de groupe.

The money that Lucelia gets from this loan will go towards purchasing bread, meat, oil, and fresh fruit to make smoothies at her local venue.

Their businesses are simple, but offer a stream of income that could never have been accomplished without such a loan for initial capital.

He is married and the father of six children, the care of whom falls upon his shoulders.  He opened a sales center for school supplies in the Ago\u00e8 district.  The objective for which he created this center is to be near the people in his district, because there is no bookstore in the area.  During this time of vacations, the price of school supplies has diminished a little, and he wishes to take advantage of this chance to stock up on books and notebooks before school starts.  To do so, he is requesting this loan to buy 5 boxes of notebooks and 80 books for primary school.  He will thus be able to earn a good income.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur A.

They live in traditional families with their husbands, in-laws and children in the village of Sikouna 1 in the Fana area (Koulikoro region in Mali). They buy and sell food condiments, charcoal and various other items. The women of the Yeredon group are related or have built strong friendships. This is their first group loan with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. The sources of their supplies vary according to the items they sell; for charcoal, it is primarily sold on the spot in the surrounding villages through farmers officially appointed to trade it in the area. The main point of their  cash sales is in Sikouna 1 and at the market on market days. Their customers are made up of wholesalers from the cities, women and some men. With this loan, they would like to grow their monthly income with which they will pay the interest on the loan and invest the remainder in their respective activities. Their long-term goal is to become wholesalers.

The Yiriwa group is involved in the breeding and the sale of livestock products (sale of live animals, butter, fresh milk, yogurt,  curdled milk, etc). This group of Peulh women (a semi-nomadic people of West Africa specialized in the breeding of cattle), bound through ethnic and linguistic but also family ties, decided to borrow together from the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. This is their first group loan. With this loan, they would like to build their supplies of cattle food and medication at the veterinary pharmacies in Fana, Marka coungo and Santiguila. They usually sell the livestock and products for cash on market days in these cities, and their business runs year round. In addition to the breeding, some of them sell various articles such as flour.

For  social reasons, she had to give up her studies to help her mother with housework and in the kitchen. After more than 15 years of working with and learning from her mother, she decided to open a restaurant. Her restaurant is located at the large Fana market on a very busy crossroad. Her clientele are mainly travellers, drivers and people going to the market. The variety of meals in her restaurant is very appreciated by the regulars. In order to obtain additional resources to support her restaurand amidst increasing competition, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance instutution. After 3 group loans through a local association, this is her fourth individual loan. All of her previous loans were refunded in time. With this loan, she would like to buy 600 kg of rice and a large quantity of condiments to build her supplies. Currently she earns approximately 35.000 FCFA, but with this new loan, hopes  to increase it to 45.000 CFA,  which she  will use to help her husband with the family expenses and to invest the remainder in her business and in buying equipment for the restaurant.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Ivana Kostic, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame Kadiatou S. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 49 ans, .m\u00e8re de 6 enfants et vit dans une famille nucl\u00e9aire avec son \u00e9poux et ses enfants \u00e0 Fana Coura un des quartiers de la sous pr\u00e9fecture de Fana (R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro R\u00e9publique du Mali).

When someone has an old or broken piece of furniture, they take it to her.  She has begun a small business repairing chairs, sofas, beds, and other furniture.  Left by her husband several years ago, Estama has found herself in the same position as many women here in the Dominican and in her home country, Haiti.  She is left to provide for her two boys (ages 14, 16) with whatever means she can.  The money from this loan will go towards purchasing paint, sand paper, various tools, as well as several old beds that may be refurbished and sold.  She aspires to continue growing her business, so that someday she might be able to own her own shop that she can work out of.\r\n<p>\r\nEstama is one of the leaders of the 10 person micro bank Hermanas Unidas, which means \"United Sisters\". All ten women in the bank are Haitian immigrants who have come to earn a living in the Dominican informal sector. These unique entrepreneurs unite in solidarity, promising to cover one another if someone fails on a payment, thus allowing them to access funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.  The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting due to the strong peer pressure from their fellow bank members.  As these 10 women embark upon their firS.ever loan from Esperanza, we are confident that they will all succeed in bettering their lives and the lives of their families with this loan. Their businesses are simple, but offer a stream of income that could never have been accomplished without such a loan for initial capital.  Several of the women sell clothes and shoes in the street, and a couple of them will offer housecleaning services and beauty supplies.\r\n<p>\r\nOn behalf of Estama M., the Hermanas Unidas group, and the entire team here at Esperanza International, we thank you for your support and awareness of the global issue of poverty, in which your efforts are helping to make a difference"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":182903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Upholstery","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase, paint, sandpaper, tools, and several old beds to be refurbished and sold.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-08-01T20:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernadette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Senatus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chartes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ernise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suzette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-16T03:05:56Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":54000,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":267,"local_amount":9011.25,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9151.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328236,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":267,"local_amount":9011.25,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9151.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362009,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":266,"local_amount":8977.5,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":9117.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312802,"comment":null},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":9140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930349,"comment":null},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":9140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854923,"comment":null},{"amount":266.66,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9140.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394205,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-02T03:05:56Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:10:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":57431,"name":"Ami","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mrs. Ami A. was born in 1979 in Nyigb\u00e9 in the Zio prefecture.

Calzada is approximately 3800 meters (12,500 ft) above sea level, a community economically based on raising livestock (cattle, sheep), agriculture (barley, wheat, oats, potatoes) and in some cases traD. activities in the fairs in the district capitals (Acobamba and Paucar\u00e1). The population is sparse and it usually takes five minutes to get from house to house.\r\n<p>\r\nVillage bank member Julia A. S. has a loan of 1000 Peruvian Nuevo Soles ($355 USD) and according to her testimony she says: \"I have a business to buy and sell livestock and I bring them to the Acobamba and Paucar\u00e1 fairs and in order to sell I need to leave at two in the morning and reach the fairs. In a few years I hope to have enough animals in order to raise and sell them when I need to. Furthermore I have a grandchild that is with me and studies at Puca Cruz. In the future I hope that he studies to become a professional after he finishes high school. In FINCA Per\u00fa I am saving for the future of my grandchild because he is the only one by my siD.. Also I want to increase my livestock. Now that I am with FINCA Per\u00fa, I have learned to save and work with more confidence, more responsibility and also to attend the training sessions.\"\r\n<p>\r\nGuillerma P. P. is working with a loan of 600 Peruvian Nuevo Soles ($213 USD) and says the following: \" I have a business to buy and sell livestock, principally sheep and at times cattle. When I see that an animal is fat I am able to sell it in the fair. My dream is to have much more livestock, to be able to raise and sell more of them in the future. I am going to save for my children\u00b4s education. Now that I have joined FINCA Per\u00fa I am going to learn how to save, because I have neighbors and relatives that have joined FINCA Per\u00fa and they tell me it is very nice to belong to a village bank. I will listen to the organization\u00b4s training, share with the other clients, work with more responsibility and acquire some items that we need. I will receive training that FINCA has promised and I am going to learn many valuable things that I want for my family and myself.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4225,"image":{"id":182952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Commercial livestock raising (cattle, sheep)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-07-19T16:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juaquina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remigia Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillerma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-06T21:10:51Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2008-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":704.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":704.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":704.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":704.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":704.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":704.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":705,"local_amount":2002.37,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2005.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":319164,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":705,"local_amount":2002.37,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-11T07:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2005.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351208,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":702.5,"local_amount":1995.26,"processed_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1998.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314512,"comment":null},{"amount":704.17,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2003.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932129,"comment":null},{"amount":704.17,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2003.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214497,"comment":null},{"amount":704.16,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2003.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396309,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-23T21:10:51Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:22:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":57450,"name":"Creolinda","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Creolinda used to work on a farm, but she had to stop because she had her daughter.

SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women: when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":183126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional DVD movies for a shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-23T14:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-13T19:06:42Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":117600,"processed_date":"2008-09-13T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":122388,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":325845,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":105,"local_amount":117600,"processed_date":"2008-10-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":122388,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":358670,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":114800.01,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":119474.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347881,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":121416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970453,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":121416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886670,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":121416.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435933,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-30T19:06:42Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":57528,"name":"Souleymane","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"This young entrepreneur is involved in the sale of basic necessity items; rice, oils etc. He maintains a general grocery store in the Kadior district.

She wants to borrow 3,604,000 VND (equivalent to 215 USD) to buy wood for her son to carve at home.  Her husband is a communal police officer, who gets a very consistent source of income.  Mrs. Kim works all day in the steel factory.  During free time, she helps her son in his carving factory.  On average, her family income is about 4,500,000 VND (equivalent to 265 USD) per month.

R. is a widow with two children. After her husband's death, she opened a store to help feed her children. The store still exists. Zumrad sells food. She wants to obtain a loan in order to increase the variety of items in her shop. It is located in a region close to the city center; therefore customers do not always have an opportunity to leave in to purchase goods. Zumrad's store gives them the opportunity to purchase goods in their town at affordable prices. Therefore, if Zumrad increases the number and variety of goods, this will help her increase her customer base and will also help people who live in the town. Zumrad plans to repay the loan within 12 months.\t<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430

C. is 32 years old.

Thanks to his energy and high spirit, he has been able to support his family for 10 years and to provide his children with an education as well. <p>\r\nSpecifically, Ahahdjon sows potatoes, onions, carrots, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Each year he grows a sufficient amount of crops to feed his family and to sell the balance for profit. At the same time, Ahahdjon raises cattle. In particular, he buys cattle at the market at a low price, feeds them, and later resells them at the same market for a higher price. <p>\r\nHis business is the main source of income for Ahahdjon and his family, though he has been feeling more pressure in recent years to generate greater income because his dearest children are growing up and, as a result, the family's expenses are on the rise. Therefore, Ahahdjon is now requesting a loan in the amount of 3,000 Somoni ($900 USD) over a 9-month term. With the loan proceeds, he plans to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizers for his farming business, and he will use a portion of the proceeds to pay the salaries of his hired seasonal workers.

A. is 39 years old. She is a widow, and she has two children. Narkhol has never had anyone's assistance in helping her children get ahead, so for the past 11 years she has been working in the sales industry; more specifically, she sells fuel and lubricants. This line of business has been her only source of income to support and to educate her children, and it has not been easy for her to bear such responsibility for her family. Even so, the love she has for her children is what drives her forward from day to day.
