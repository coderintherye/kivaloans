Irshaad is hopeful that her son, who has been operating this business for the past five years, will get the desired results from his work with the loan investment. \r\n\r\nIrshaad is a very supportive lady. In order to financially assist her family, she sells milk. She has a buffalo at home whose milk she sells to clients in her community at a reasonable rate. Her buffalo produces 8-10 kg of milk per day and she sells 1 kg of milk at approximately 45 Pakistani rupees which is almost the same price in every city. Her earned income allows her to pay off the utilities and to manage the financial affairs of her family smoothly.\r\n\r\nIrshaad has three other sons and three daughters. Her sons do different kinds of businesses and play their part for the financial survival of their family. Her daughters stay at home and help their mother in her daily works. Irshaad has been living in the city of Jaranwala for the past many years. Jaranwala is a small city in Punjab, Pakistan, known for its agricultural industry. She lives with her family in a two-room brick house. \r\n\r\nIrshaad is a regular client of Asasah and this is her second loan application. In her previous loan year, she established good credit behavior and never missed a meeting. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, the lady with a book (an Asasah passbook) is

With the money from the sale she was able to buy two more pigs and she has been working to grown her business. She needs this loan to buy more pigs, feed, and also she wishes to buy a pair of sheep to begin raising sheep.

She relates that she makes bath mats, embroidered napkins, and party decorations.

It is a growing group in the process of consolidation. They are part of the Villa Exaltacion central office. The group is made up of 8 women and  1 man.\nEach of the members already has their own business, such as: grain sales, supplies sales, Internet, macrame, cosmetics sales, and appliances, crafts, food packaging, slipper sales, and food sales. The Bolivianitas Communal Bank is managed by a president, treasurer and a secretary, all of whom were elected by the group members. The group president, Marianela, has been part of other Communal Banks for seven years, and has been part of the Bolovianitas Communal Bank for two years.\nMarianela is currently single, so she has to take care of her children alone. She has four children, three of whom live with her and one of whom has a partner and a house. Marianela's business is selling home products--food and home electronics. She started with a very small amount of capital 18 years ago. \nMarianela is requesting a loan to increase her working capital and purchase what her customers are asking for, whether it be food items or home electronics.

Also, she bought land with 2.5 million MNT of her business earnings in 2008. \r\n\r\nNow, her working capital is 2 million MNT and she sells a lot of seasonal kids' clothing.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

She is married and has 3 children aged 30, 26 and 25. In 2000, she established her vegetable farming business. Working 7 days a week and 6 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to buys seeds and fertilizers for vegetable farming. In the future, Anju plans to lift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal) and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold at the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She is married and has 2 children aged 10 and 8. In 2000, she established her cow raising business.  Working 7 days a week and 4 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy a young milk cow. In the future, Kavita plans to lift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. At the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy a young dairy cow.  In the future, Radha plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Katmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She earns her living by operating one business venture: fruits and vegetables vending. Her husband, Michael, who is 35 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between 1 and 12 years old. Four of their children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nAnselma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anselma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy fruits to sell to a market so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and expansion of her business. Anselma is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

D. is from the village of Mainit, Catarman, Camiguin Province. She is 46 years old. Maria is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Maria owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk foods, detergents, biscuits & toothpaste in the local community. Maria has been engaged in her business for over 19 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maria joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Maria is requesting a new loan of 21000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like junk foods & canned goods. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Maria from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand the  business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":699353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gemma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & bananas. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Gemma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

B. is from the village of Maac, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province. He is 33 years old. Mario is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Mario owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling green bananas in the local community. Mario has been engaged in his business for over 2 years and earns approximately 9000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mario joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Mario is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional green and sweet bananas. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Mario from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Margie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Margie is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like cosmetics & blouses. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Margie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the  business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":699378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

Leonilo has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Leonilo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonilo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase materials needed to provide service. Leonilo is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase tools needed for the maintenance of the service. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Leonilo from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":699386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase

N. is a married woman who lives in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a Pedicab (bicycle rickshaw) business. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Reynaldo N., who is 35 years old, works as a painter to earn his living. They have one child who is 12 years old. \r\n\r\nMarla joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marla has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 27,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her sixth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell and for additional capital for the business, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her child. \r\n\r\nMarla is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Feliza is requesting a new loan, her fourth from HSPFI, of 15,000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional products to sell like snacks and canned goods. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHagdan sa Pag-uswag Foundation, Inc., or HSPFI, is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

C. is a married woman who lives in Bantayanan, Brgy. Molaw, Compostela, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: abaca weaving and a motorcycle operator business. Her husband, Randy C., is 33 years old. He buys and sells fire wood to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 3 and 7 years old. \r\n\r\nGinalyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ginalyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing 11,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more materials for weaving so that she can continue to save up for future home improvement and for her children\u2019s education. Ginalyn C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in the village of Agay-ayan, Gingoog City. To make a living, Eden owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling specialty food products such as chicken and pork kebab, boiled eggs or balot, peanuts, and chicharon in the local community. Eden has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month. She is also running a retail store selling snack foods and canned goods.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Eden joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eden has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional ingredients and acquire working capital. Eden is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients such as pork and chicken meat. This loan will be Eden's second loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rasul is 48 years old, married and has two children. He is the sole breadwinner for his family, and his only income comes from raising and selling large livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n<p>\r\nToday Rasul is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. To do this, he needs $2500 USD to purchase additional young cattle. Rasul has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich place in history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the farthest reach of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

M. is a married lady.  Her husband is a driver, and they have four children, aged between twenty-two years old and eight years old. Her business is located at Mukuru kwa Njenga in Nairobi, and she is served by the Kitengela branch. She owns a grocery store in which she sells such items as kale, bananas and tomatoes. She has been in this business for the last five years. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge  is that there are so many people doing the same kind of business in the area. Customers are not loyal, as they are spoilt for choice. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 60,000 to buy more kale, tomatoes and other vegetables to grow her business and meet the demands of her customers. She hopes to be a wholesaler in future and also to diversify into the salon business. She describes herself as aggressive and

O. is fifty eight years old, married and has four children who are between the ages  twenty four  and thirty five years old.  Her business is located at Shikoti market in Kakamega and is well known by its name Shama medical clinic.  \r\n\r\nKakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and is commonly referred as the sugar belt region.  She owns a clinic in which she has been providing treatment as well as selling drugs to the local people, school children and teachers.  She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is low purchasing power by the people in the area.

They have 8 children who are 17 to 30 years old - 4 of them have their own family, 3 employed children to help the family and 1 is currently going to school.  \r\n\r\nApolinaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Apolinaria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 34,000 PHP, thus increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP which she intends to use as more funds for her business operations so that she could continue to save up for the future, education of her child and for home repairs.  \r\n\r\nApolinaria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is a 44-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating 3 different business ventures: a general store, a car rental service and a fish-vending business. She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 14,000. \r\n\r\nNilda is borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. A recent loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nilda hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \u201cHonorable\u201d). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He provides barber services to the local people. He also sells CDs, radio cassettes, VCDs and DVDs. He has been in this business for the last two years and has managed to employ one person. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is that there are so many people doing the same kind of business as his in the area and so customers are not loyal as they are spoiled for choice.

Her husband Ernesto J., who is 45 years old, works as a multi-cab driver to earn his living. They have 4 children who are 5 to 22 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nAfricana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Africana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her to earn a monthly profit of PHP 24,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more goods to sell so that she can continue to save for the future. Her priorities are to educate her children and to repair their house. Africana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Glendel is a 42 year old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: transport (Multicab), cake making and rag making businesses. She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her transport (Multicab), cake making and rag making businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 40,000. Ma. Glendel is borrowing PHP 22,000 so that she could fund her business operations.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ma. Glendel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.   \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, buying and selling of charcoal and woods and rice vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 50,000. Carmen is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she could fund her business operations. This will be her 6th  loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Carmen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Loma\" (HillsiD.) and is located in Palmillas community, in San Felipe del Progreso.  The community currently has access to all public services but, in the past, it didn't.  However, it has gradually grown over time and the inhabitants now have access to public services and cement structures.  The people and their customs are the only things that haven't changed.\r\n\r\nSome of the people in the community work raising animals and others work in commerce.  All of the children have easy access to education so that they can enjoy a better future.  They are all studying and their parents are more concerned about them getting an education than they were in the past.\r\n\r\nThere are 8 members in the \"L. Loma\" group: 6 women and 2 men.  They gave their group the name \"L. Loma\" because they are all close neighbors and they live on the same hillsiD..  All of the group's members are engaged in commerce and sell different products.  Their names are as follows:\r\n1.-Jilia C. R. - 52 years old\r\n2.-MarceL. G. L. - 36 years old\r\n3.-Belem L. D. L. L. - 28 years old\r\n4.-Bertha C. T. - 28 years old\r\n5.-Maria Andrea R. C. - 21 years old\r\n6.-Margarita D. L. C. F. - 30 years old\r\n7.-Roberto H. C. - 34 years old\r\n8.-Ruben G. R. - 22 years old\r\n\r\nThe leader of this group is Bertha.  She is 28 years old and has been married for 9 years.  She lives with her husband in her own home.  She has two daughters who are in elementary school.  Bertha's husband works in a market in the center of San Felipe, selling fruit and vegetables.  In order to help her husband, Bertha sells children's clothes and children's underwear (underpants and socks).  She sells her products in her own community of Palmillas.  She sets up outsiD. her daughters' school, laying down a cloth on the ground so that she can set out her merchandise and start making her sales.\r\n\r\nBertha tells us that the most difficult part of her work is that she has to proviD. her clothes on credit because people tell her that they don't have enough money to pay her straight away.  For this reason, she sells her products and collects payment in instalments so that she is able to make her sales.  She uses the small amount of money that she makes (she tells us that it isn't much) to help her husband pay for food for their daughters, so that they have something to take to school for breakfast and so that they can eat well when they get home.  One of Bertha's goals is to acquire business premises in the center of town where she can better sell her clothes and she would also like to improve her financial situation.  Bertha would like, over time, for her business to do better and she would like to find her own business premises."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":695688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy children's underwear (underpants and socks)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-24T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rub\u00e9n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7542.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850105,"comment":null},{"amount":937.5,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":11313.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292379,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7542.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160637,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3771.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233515,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-24T22:17:47Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":267941,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos, de 52 a\u00f1os, es un hombre jovial y trabajador, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposa y sus 4 hijas de los 6 que son en total.

L. is a member of the group \"CUANICUTI\".  They named their group after some condominiums in their area and this is where they will hold their weekly meetings.  She is very proud to be a member of this group as she is the representative.  Do\u00f1a Fabiola is originally from Naucalpan de Ju\u00e1rez in Mexico state.  Because of family matters, she came with her parents to live in Zitacuaro Michoac\u00e1n 20 years ago.  She is 30 years old and studied social work.  She says that she is not working in her professional field because she got married and decided to dedicate her time to her family.  Do\u00f1a Fabi, as her friends and family call her, sells catalog products and also works as a sales coordinator for a cosmetics company.  She has worked at this job for more than 4 years.   She started selling catalog products because, when she was a young girl, she used to help her mother sell catalog products.  She also helps her husband sell and maintain copiers as well as selling copier cartridges, toner and stationary.  She says that she has approximately 10 years of experience in the copier business and that her husband, Se\u00f1or Uriel, was the one who taught her this business.  He runs this small business out of their home, saving on rent. They have a daughter named Melanie who is 8 years old and attends elementary school.  Se\u00f1ora Fabiola says that her goal is to have a fixed location where she can sell cosmetics and other catalog products and move the copier business there.    She says that she will save the earnings from her catalog and copier sales to purchase a piece of land where she can have the commercial site that she dreams of. \r\n\r\nBlanca Estela C. M. is another member of the group \"CUANICUTI\" and is 54 years old.  She finished school until 6th grade and says that she could not continue her studies because her parents couldn't continue supporting her.   Her parents said that women didn't have to go to school because they would just get married and an education would be no use.  Do\u00f1a Blanca is married to Se\u00f1or Miguel who works as a line repairman.  They had 6 children and they are all now married.  Do\u00f1a Blanca sells used clothing at the supply center in Zitacuaro.  She has had a stand there for about 8 years now.  She decided to start this business as a way to help her husband with her medical expenses because she was suffering from menopause and had to purchase expensive medication.  She used to work as a seamstress.  She made wedding dresses, quincea\u00f1era dresses and evening gowns, but, unfortunately, her illness caused her to slowly lose her sight and she couldn't continue sewing.  She is a very hard-working person.  She gets up at 6 am every day to go to work in Toluca in Mexico state to sell her clothing and every Thursday she leaves even earlier to get a spot in the open air market in town.  In Toluca, she buys large quantities of used clothing.  Do\u00f1a Blanca is requesting a loan to purchase used clothing and she also plans to buy used shoes to sell at her stand.

Maria and her family live in Vista Hermosa community, in the town of Tierra Blanca, in the State of Veracruz.  Mary (as she is known in her community) tells us that over a year ago she decided to set up her own business in order to help her husband and son with their household expenses.  She sells firewood which she goes out to the countryside to find together with her son.  They make bundles and sell them in the town.  Maria also raises pigs in a small pen located behind her home.  She tells us that she started out with one pig and, with the profits she made from selling it, she bought two more.  Maria needs this loan to invest in buying pigs and feed.\r\n\r\nMary tells us that she hopes, in the future, to build a pen from blocks, iron rods and cement, and to buy more pigs so that she can continue raising animals.

Currently the younger ones still live at home with her and to elementary school and to preschool.\r\n\r\nOver seventeen years ago she started her Mexican fast food sales business.  She sells from Monday through Friday in the morning and during weekend evenings in a small passageway she built in front of her house.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Amanda needs this loan to buy ingredients (beans, oil, corn, meat, tomatoes, cabbage, chilies, onions, tortillas, eggs and potatoes).

His does not find his business difficult and is used to the work.  He knows what it means to be a salesman and doesn't worry too much.

colores, tamb\u00eden vende ropa interior para la mujer, do\u00f1a Maribel nos comenta que son tiempos dificiles pero le hace la lucha a todo para sacar dinero y con la ayuda de su esposo que nos cuenta que es muy trabajador se siente con m\u00e1s apoyo y la llena de entusiasmo para salir adelante y no ver las cosas dificiles si no al contrario.\n\nEn el negocio que tiene en el tianguis nos comenta que hay dias en que se vende bien y otros no tanto, pero no se desanima puesto que dice que el negocio es as\u00ed, lo pesado de salir a vender en el tianguis es poner y recoger el puesto, sale de su casa en San Agustin a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para estar en San Felipe a las cinco y media de la ma\u00f1ana y empezar a poner el puesto, a esa hora por lo regular ya estan los demas comerciantes, a mas tardar a las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana la gente ya esta comprando en el tianguis.\n\n\nLa meta de do\u00f1a Maribel es no deber dinero y que la mercanc\u00eda que compre sea propia, por ejemplo ahora solicito un prestamo pero lo tiene que pagar y por eso trabaja muy duro, y siente que la mercancia no es de ella, quiere ahorrar y con el tiempo tener un patrimonio y no deber dinero.\n\n\nCon las ganancias aparte de querer ahorrar tamb\u00eden le sirve para ayudar a su esposo para la comida o el gasto de su hijo con la escuela.\n\nEl esposo de do\u00f1a Maribel es muy trabajador y hace de todo, cria animales para vender, es alba\u00f1il y tambien comerciante los fines de semana y do\u00f1a Maribel se siente muy apoyada y cree en salir adelnate pronto con un esposo como el de ella. ","en":"Do\u00f1a Maribel is married and has a 14-year-old son who is in high school.  She lives in San Agustin Mextepec in San Felipe del Progreso, Mexico.  Maribel's husband also works hard and both of them make every effort on a daily basis to improve their economic situation and to give their son the best education.  Maribel and her family live with her father-in-law and they all get along well.\r\n\r\nMaribel has set up a grocery store at home where she sells fruit, vegetables, groceries, sweets and cookies.  She works at this business during the week.  And on the weekends she sets up a stall at the San Felipe del Progreso market where she sells women's stockings and men's socks in different textures and colors.  She also sells women's underwear.  Maribel says that these are difficult times but she does all she can to earn a living.  She says her husband works hard and gives her a lot of support and this makes her even more enthusiastic because otherwise things would be too difficult.\r\n\r\nShe says that sales from her stall have good days and bad, but she says business is like that.  The hardest part is setting up and taking down the stall.  She leaves the house in San Agustin at 5:00 a.m. in order to reach San Felipe by 5:30 a.m. and start setting up.  At 7:00 a.m.people start buying at the stall.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Maribel's goal is not to owe money for the goods she buys.  She is requesting a loan now but is determined to pay it back with hard work. She wants to save and over time have her own money and not owe to anyone.\r\n\r\nIn addition to saving money she wants to use part of her earnings to help her husband with food and school expenses for her son.\r\n\r\nMaribel's husband is a hard worker and does all kinds of jobs.  He raises animals for sale, works as a bricklayer and also sells on weekends.  Maribel feels very supported and believes she will be successful with a husband like hers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":664007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy stockings, socks, and underwear for men and women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1016.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1100.08},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1127.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1192.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1248.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1315.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.62},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.19},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.16,"local_amount":1016.91,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1051.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850116,"comment":null},{"amount":94.3,"local_amount":1100.08,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1137.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292390,"comment":null},{"amount":96.62,"local_amount":1127.23,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160648,"comment":null},{"amount":102.19,"local_amount":1192.29,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1233.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233526,"comment":null},{"amount":106.98,"local_amount":1248.12,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512386,"comment":null},{"amount":112.75,"local_amount":1315.37,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223084,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T14:26:32Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":267967,"name":"La Manzana Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El siguiente grupo se encuentra ubicado en la comunidad D.

The group is called \"La Manzana\" (The Apple) and is maD. up of 12 people, 11 women and one man.  The town is small and and very few people live there.  It is a very woody area with a lot of trees.  The climate is cold despite the bright sunshine and most people live high on the hill.  People here are kind and hard-working and live very simple lives.  Most of them are involved in retail sales and others are farmers.  This group has both types of income.  The members of the group are the following:\r\n\r\n1.-Ubaldo C. Gonzales\r\n2,.Rosa C.

Do\u00f1a Rosa has a hard time making ends meet and maintaining the level of education for her children.  But she does this so they will be successful and have a better lifestyle.  Rosa sells bedspreads by catalogue.  With her earnings she pays for transportation costs for her four children.  Her husband takes care of household expenses and other things.  Rosa's problem is that sometimes she has to wait for payment on orders she has already delivered and sometimes she doesn't get paid at all.  Her dream is to earn enough for her children to continue their studies.  For now that's all she wants since she can't aspire to more by only selling

They have five year old twins named Pedro and Araceli.  Enrique\u2019s main job is providing transportation services with his motorcycle taxi, an activity he engages in every day from the early morning until the late evening hours.  He works alone so that he can earn as much income to benefit his family.  Occasionally while working his motorcycle will break down, so he must make the repairs himself.  He learned how to do this by watching mechanics perform their work.  From that point, he acquires parts so that he does not have to pay for maintenance.  Enrique is very happy and proud of everything he has.  He enjoys his work, so he provides good transportation services to his neighbors and street pedestrians.  Enrique is very honest with the fares he charges his passengers.  His greatest wish is to grow coffee in his hometown so that he can export it.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.

The group is made up of five women who know each other and are neighbors.  They are: Mrs. Priciliana B. G. who wants to use her loan to buy corn, oil, tortillas, vegeteables, etc. Mrs. Elvia S\u00e1nchez E. is going to buy flour, eggs, and oil to make wafers for her \"pozole\".

Mrs. Alfonsa Rosa S\u00e1nchez E. is going to buy corn, firewood and a tortilla-making machine.  Mrs. Leticia Elizabeth L. S\u00e1nchez will buy flour, eggs and oil for her wafers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Valeria Saturnina Anzurez Lav\u00edn is 54 years old and studied Childcare for three years at the technical institute.  She is a widow with five children: Sonia who is 33, Omero who is 32, Alberto who is 30, Jorge who is 28 and Mirna who is 23.  All of her children are teachers.  The four oldest ones are marrked and the younger one is single.  Mrs. Valeria is a seamstress.  She is requesting a loan to buy fabric, thread, lace, scissors and goods to stock her grocery store which she plans to open.  Her children will give her between $3,000 and $6,000 to set up and she will use the loan to pay for the rest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Valeria makes school uniforms, dancing costumes, skirts, dresses, etc.  She began her business 35 years ago when she was single.  She learned her trade in Huazulco where she lived with her parents.  She later married and moved to Amilcingo and set up her shop.  Since her husband was a teacher he recommended her services to students' parent.  She inherited one of her sewing machines from her mother and her husband bought her the other one.  \r\n\r\nShe also studied nursing but did not finish.  She does give injections though, out of her home, and she offers her sewing services to her customers.  The latter is what pays for the food in her household.  Her children pay utility expenses.  What she likes best about her business is that she gets to sew all the typical costumes.  And she is very proud to help her husband who once had to leave his teaching post due to illness.\r\n\r\nHer business is very well known for the quality of her work.  She has a lot of competition since there are 4 women in her street who are seamstresses.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Valeria is planning to set up her grocery store with the loan and help from her children.  Her business has helped her family greatly, especially building the house, remodelling it and making adjustments.  Amilcingo is pretty and quiet.  They grow amaranth, sorghum and peanuts there.  They also make wafers, sweets, tamarind swets and there are people to buy and sell peanuts.

Antelma tiene una papeler\u00eda en su domicilio, negocio que inicio desde hace mas de 4 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, lo que la  motivo a iniciar este negocio en primer lugar fue la necesidad de la gente que habita en la poblaci\u00f3n, ya que existe un gran n\u00famero de ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes que estudia en diferentes escuelas dentro y fuera de la comunidad y que carecen de materiales did\u00e1cticos necesarios para elaborar sus tareas y trabajos escolares, antes de iniciar la papeler\u00eda los pobladores ten\u00edan que viajar a la ciudad de Pinotepa para adquirir sus productos, haciendo mas costosos los precios de los materiales did\u00e1cticos necesarios para la educaci\u00f3n de los estudiantes de su pueblo.\nAntelma   se uni\u00f3 a un grupo de cr\u00e9dito para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito de dinero, para la compra de material did\u00e1ctico y de papeler\u00eda, como son: libretas, cuadernos, pegamento blanco, l\u00e1pices de colores, l\u00e1pices de grafito, bol\u00edgrafos, tijeras, carpetas, cartulina, hojas de papel Bond, juegos geom\u00e9tricos, regla de medir, comp\u00e1s para trazar c\u00edrculos, \u00e1bacos, crayones, clips, cartuchos de engrapadoras, papel lustre, papel crepe.\nLas ganancias que Antelma, son destinadas par la compra  de mas  materiales y mercanc\u00eda necesaria para su papeler\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n para cubrir los pagos de su cr\u00e9dito. Otro de los proyectos que esta admirable mujer va a emprender es un ciber caf\u00e9, por la necesidad de este servicio en su comunidad, ya que las personas que estudian carecen de esta indispensable herramienta para su preparaci\u00f3n escolar.\nLa esperanza que tiene Antelma, es tener buena salud para seguir aportando los medios necesarios que su pueblo requiere para un buen  desarrollo, hacer crecer su negocio, mejorarlo en todos los aspectos, ampliar su papeler\u00eda, impulsar sus proyectos, y que su situaci\u00f3n familiar siempre este estable y llena de armon\u00eda y comunicaci\u00f3n.\nLo que mas desea es que  sus compa\u00f1eras de grupos no dejen de hacerse responsable con su cr\u00e9dito que a todas ellas les valla de lo mejor, de igual manera desea que los ni\u00f1os que dependen de estas familias no les falte nada.\nAntelma agradece la confianza que le da fundaci\u00f3n realidad, al otorgarle su cr\u00e9dito, a Kiva que sin conocerlas le brindan este gran respaldo econ\u00f3mico.\nEl grupo \u201cDalias de Rancho Viejo\u201d, se conforma por un total de 13 mujeres, que a continuaci\u00f3n se dan los nombres de las personas que lo integran, as\u00ed como su actividad personal de cada integrante.\n\nYuvanitzi Semei F.

It is about 17 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional.  The name comes from the dahlia flower for its unique beauty and because each of the members feels represented by and identifies with this floral species.  The group is made up of 13 women and their representative is Mar\u00eda Isabel R. M..\r\n\r\nWe will focus this narrative on the life of Antelma R. C. who is 45 years old and married to Rosaelio who is 44.  He is an elementary school teacher.  They have 3 children, Cinthia who is 9 and in 4th grade, Darinel who is 8 and in 3rd grade and Rosaelio who is 6 and just started first grade.  Antelma has a stationers business in her home and has been working at this for over four years.  She set up the business because there was a need for school materials for all the children who study in the community.  Before she began her business everyone had to go to the city of Pinotepa to buy everything and this made it all more expensive.\r\n\r\nAntelma joined the group to apply for a loan to buy school materials and stationery suppliers such as notebooks, binders, glue, colored pencils, lead encils, pens, scissors, folders, cardboard, Bond paper, geometric games, rulers, compasses, abacus, crayons, clips, staples, tissue paper, crepe paper.\r\n\r\nAntelma's earnings are used to buy more materials and goods for her store and also to pay back her loan.  This admirable woman also wants to set up a cyber cafe because her community needs one and the students do not have this very necessary tool available for their education.\r\n\r\nAntelma hopes to have good health so she can continue contributing to the needs of her town.  She wants to develop and expand her business and improve it in all regards.  She wants to carry out all her projects and maintain a stable, harmonious lifestyle for her family.\r\n\r\nWhat she hopes for most is that her group colleagues are able to pack back the loan, and that things go well for all of them so that their children have what they need.\r\n\r\nAntelma appreciates the confidence shown by Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and by Kiva in granting this type of economic support.

Erika is 27 years old, only went to high school and is married to Sr. Armando Reyes. Together they have two children: a seven-year-old boy named Wilian and a six-year-old girl named Monserrat. They attend primary school together.  Erika and her family live in a community called Vista Hermosa (\"Beautiful View\") that belongs to the municipality of Tierra Blanca in the state of Veracruz. In order to arrive at the Vista Hermosa community, one must take a bus from Tierra Blanca that only leaves twice per day: once in the morning and once at noon. The majority of times, people take a bus that drops them off on a road that is another 20 minute walk from their homes. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Erika tells us that a little more than five months ago, she decided to begin her own business selling undergarments for women. She goes door to door in her community, bringing catalogs with her. She brings the order to her suppliers and when it arrives, she delivers it to her customers and receives a payment for her products. She also says that on the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays), she makes chiles rellenos (stuffed chili peppers) and donuts filled with dulce de leche (a caramel sauce) and gelatine treats. She offers these products to her clients and delivers them upon request.  Do\u00f1a Erika tells us that she decided to begin her own business because she wanted to help her husband with the living expenses as well as the expenses of her little children's studies.

He makes and sells 'arroz de lisa' (a rice and fish dish).  This dish is a typical Barranquillera dish and is made with 'lisa', a sea fish which lays its eggs in brackish water such as river mouths.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto also sells 'bu\u00f1uelos' (a type of fritter), empanadas (stuffed pastries), 'deditos' (cheese fingers) and other delicacies that he prepares together with his wife and then transports on his three-wheeled vehicle which he acquired with his first loan from our foundation.  Thanks to our organization, Jos\u00e9 Alberto has managed to grow in his business and gradually fill his display case, his cooking pots and his soft drinks cooler.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Alberto's main customers are neighbors in his own community where he has a captive market as he is located in a bus and mototaxi station and this is where his main customers are found.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto started this business two years ago after changing his business activity.  He used to hand-make and sell ladies' footwear but that business had a long production process and he made minimal profits.  For this reason, when he decided to join our foundation, he took advantage of the situation and changed his business to something which he knew and which was profitable.  Through his loans, he has managed to stabilize his business and he plans, in the future, to buy a cooler in which to keep his fish and meat.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Jos\u00e9 Alberto's third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he will use it to buy supplies such as rice, meat, cheese, flour and sugar wholesale.  His financial indicators show his accounts receivable turnover period at 1 day, his raw material turnover period at 2 days and his profits at 27%.  With this new investment, he plans to earn discounts by purchasing his supplies in larger quantities before new prices go into effect at the beginning of the

Avil\u00e9s is from Huitzililla, in the city of Ayala, state of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 54 years old, and she has a second grade education.  She has a 16 year old daughter, Rosa Isela, who is working on her high school diploma.  \r\n\r\nShe has a business selling Jafra and Avon by catalog.  She will use the loan to buy the Jafra and Avon products that her customers request.  She will also use it to improve the kitchen in her house.  She has been selling her customers perfumes, lipstick, nail polish, and cosmetics, etc. for three years.  A friend invited her.  First, she started with Avon.  Then she started selling Jafra.  She goes door to door to sell her products.  She shows her catalogs and marks down what they want.  She takes the order and later delivers it to the customer\u2019s house.  She started with her own money.  She has extra products, and her customers go to her house to buy them as presents.  Her business is important because it is used to get food, pay expenses, and pay the loan.\r\n\r\nShe likes everything about her business.  She likes selling Jafra more because she earns more.  It is going well for her, and she gets good earnings.  She is proud of her business when she makes a sale for cash.  Her customers are girls, young women, and ladies.  She sells perfumes, lipstick, nail polish, plastic containers, and cosmetics.  Her business selling Avon is very popular.  The challenge she faces in her business is that sometimes she does not have the money to pay.  When her husband has it, he lends it to her.  She also faces a lot of competition selling Avon and Jafra.  She uses the income from her business to pay the loan.  She is planning on selling \u201cdobladitas\u201d (a type of Chilean bread) and rice tacos.  She plans to do that with the next loan that she is given.  \r\n\r\nThe improvements she wants to make on her house are to plaster the rooms, paint them, and to put down a floor in the kitchen.  Her plans and hopes are to get ahead, improve her house, and to have a truck.  She is very happy with this loan because it will help her business and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":698323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy Jafra and Aavon perfumes and lipsticks and to buy clothes to stock her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huitzililla, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":641.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430859,"comment":null},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850125,"comment":null},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292399,"comment":null},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160657,"comment":null},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":641.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T23:19:30Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":267984,"name":"Jose Tomas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en San Francisco Gotera, departamento de Moraz\u00e1n, vive con su esposa y su hija de 9 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l es empleado de una asociaci\u00f3n cooperativa de servicios el\u00e9ctricos, tiene un a\u00f1o de estar desempe\u00f1ando el cargo de notificador y motorista.\nJos\u00e9 en sus actividades debe caminar mucho para poder dar entrega a las notificaciones de los clientes, por lo se ve en la necesidad de comprar una motocicleta para poder realizar el trabajo f\u00e1cilmente, para realizar esta compra \u00e9l solicita un pr\u00e9stamo ya que no cuenta con fondos para hacer la adquisici\u00f3n de la motocicleta.\nSu objetivo es que a trav\u00e9s del pr\u00e9stamo pueda tener la motocicleta que seria una gran ayuda en el desarrollo de sus actividades laborales ya que as\u00ed estar\u00e1 desempe\u00f1ando una buena funci\u00f3n y trabajando por proveer para su familia lo necesario  y ayudar a su hija en los estudios ya que su sue\u00f1o es que sea una profesional de \u00e9xito.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 31 years old and resides in San Francisco Gotera, Department of Moraz\u00e1n, with his wife and nine year old daughter.

She tells us that every day she sets out a little table in front of her home where she places her chicken and, as her customers already know her, they come to buy from her without her having to go out and actively make sales.  She tells us that she decided to start her own business as she wanted to help her husband with their household expenses and  their children's education expenses as they have a lot of children and Adan's earnings didn't stretch far enough.  She also tells us that she would like to open a small grocery store in her home.
