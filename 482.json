Her dream is to have a well-built house, made of good solid materials, because she lost both her house and all of her merchandise in the earthquake that hit Chile this past February. After the earthquake, Maria, her husband, her daughter and her grandson lived in a tent for one month. Through Fondo Esperanza they were able to get a small temporary dwelling made from wood panels. \r\n \r\nMaria is very thankful for the support that Fondo Esperanza has given to her and her family, not only for the loans but also for the concern that they have shown them, particularly after the earthquake.\r\n\r\nSan Vicente de Tagua Tagua is a community in Chile's central zone, in the region of Libertador General Bernardo O\u2019Higgins, located on the banks of the Estero Zamorano river.

She has been farming for two years.  She inherited plots of land from her father.  She plants and harvests coffee on this land.  Even though she considers it to be good income, it is seasonal work.  The plants need time to finish growing until it is time to harvest them.\r\n\r\nShe also sells cosmetics door to door.  She generates more income this way.  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, when it is harvest time she hires people to make the work go faster.  That way she is able to quickly sell her production at the main markets in neighboring cities.  That is why she gets good earnings.\r\n\r\nHer main objective now is to augment her agricultural business and to continue selling cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

is a 37-year-old mother of two who lives with her husband and children in Ipis, located in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. A dedicated mother and businesswoman, Yesenia is originally from Nicaragua. When she first arrived in Costa Rica, she was looking for work cleaning houses. Over time, she started a family and became a naturalized Costa Rican citizen. Now, Yesenia runs a business selling plastic products such as garbage bins, baskets, tubs, soap dishes and toothbrushes. \r\n\r\nYesenia travels throughout her community in order to sell her products to neighbors, acquaintances and family members. She offers her clients a catalogue full of items she sells. Yesenia then collects and places the orders. When she receives the products, she makes deliveries. She also maintains an inventory of products she knows to be popular. She hopes to use this loan to invest in various plastic products in preparation for the Christmas season, when she expects to experience an upsurge in demand for her products. Recently, her main obstacle has been a lack of working capital, necessary to make investments in inventory. \r\n\r\nIn general, Yesenia carries out the domestic responsibilities of cooking and cleaning the house in the mornings.

The group is formed by 10 members, whose only goal is to always get ahead. A particular case of this is Mr. Alex L., who is 35 years old. Everyday he wakes up very early to open up his grocery store, which has provided him with good income and a lot of satisfaction in the last 4 years. The store has allowed him to buy furniture for his home and a motorcycle taxi which he is starting to use as another source of income. In the future he would like to be able to build houses to then rent them. He will use this loan to buy a glass cabinet to display his groceries as well as Christmas merchandise given the upcoming holidays.

All of their children are degree holders and are busy of their own professional work.  Victoria is old already, but is still strong and determined to have her own source of income.\r\n\r\nThe main source of she and her husband's income is their rug making business which they have had for six years now. The rugs are crafted by sewing pieces of remnant fabric together.  Once they make a small or big rug, they sell it. According to Victoria, this business gives them enough income to cover their expenses.  Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has also contributed to helping their business do well.  This is the second time a loan of Victoria's has been posted to the Kiva website for funding.  She hopes to use the proceeds of this loan to make her rug making business grow more. If she is able to generate greater profit from her business, she wants to save for the future of her

R. is a hard-working entrepreneur determined to improve her family's standard of living. She joined Kiva partner ASHI in 2005 to gain access to loans to support her entrepreneurial dreams.  During the course of her membership in ASHI, she has been a model member.  The first few loans she received enabled her to support her family\u2019s rug-making business. Susan hopes to expand her business and meet the growing demands of her customers.  She is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount of 30,000 PHP to purchase raw materials needed by her business.  The capital will fund further expansion of the family venture to support Susan\u2019s dreams for her three children and her grandchildren to have a decent way of life.  Her long-term goal is to have a manufacturing shop years from now so that she can provide employment opportunities to others in her

Magielyn has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Magielyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. As a result, she was better able to engage in business activities and to improve her standard of living. Recently, Magielyn successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. That prior loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Magielyn is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 22,000 PHP ($525), which will again be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product line. Notably, this loan would be the eighth loan taken out by Magielyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated on account of the requested loan to improve and expand her business.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She lives there with her family in a three-room brick house. She moved there after her marriage to B. A., 20 years ago. Her husband grows crops in the fields. He grows different kinds of crops like sugarcane, cotton and wheat, according to the season, and generates income for the family. His income allows him to manage the financial circle of his family.  \r\n\r\nShahida not only plays the responsibilities of a housewife, but also operates an animal sales business as well. She specifically deals with goats. She buys young goats, raises them up and sells them to customers in need. She does this work to share the financial burden with her husband. She has given birth to a son, who is an electrician by profession and also contributes to the family financially. Her family is very small, but they love to spend time with each other and share their happiness and sorrows with each other. \r\n\r\nShahida has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for her animal sales business. With the loan, she will buy young goats and improve her business. She is confident that this investment will bring positive change in her business and she will successfully sell more goats to her customers and makes her income double in size. She is a new loan user of Asasah and this is her first loan application.  \r\n\r\nIn the photo, the lady who holds a book (the Asasah passbook) in her hands is Shahida.

Most of the farmland needs irrigation which is a challenge for farmers. A large part of land in Kyrgyzstan is used for crop cultivation, but even more of this mountainous country is used as pasture for livestock and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nDamira B. is a 44-year-old farmer from Tokmok who is married with two sons. Her eldest son has a temporary income from his job and her younger son goes to school. The whole family relies on their land as a source of income. A basic part of their income is the sale of strawberries; they also cultivate land for other crops and raise livestock. Damira\u2019s family took a risk to start raising livestock, but it has been a good decision with good results. They have purchased new carpets for their house, replaced old linoleum, and made household repairs. The family hopes to use this loan to purchase more livestock animals for breeding.  \r\n\r\nDuishokul C. is 52 years old and also sells strawberries. Duishokul applied for this loan to purchase livestock to expand her business. She hopes that, after a while, she will be able to give her husband the car of his dreams and have a two-sided refrigerator for herself. \r\n\r\nAinura M. is 37 years old and she and her husband sell strawberries. Ainura has already begun to enjoy the fruits of her labor. She hopes to use this loan to increase the number of cattle that she has as well as purchase new furniture for her bedroom.  \r\n\r\nAigul S. is 50 years old and is engaged in the strawberry business. She plans to use this loan to buy livestock. She is sure that she will be a success, because there was a time when her business was raising cattle.\r\n\r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Senior citizens have to worry about their financial condition, while as a matter of principle, they should have a quiet, carefree life. Such professions as a teacher, an engineer and a doctor were considered the most prestigious ones. But nowadays, the salary of teachers is so miserable that most of them have to start a business here or leave for another country to work at a worthy job. This story is about a teacher and a retiree, who happen to fight for a convenient life regardless of their degree and age.\r\n\r\nMakun M. is a 58-year-old retiree. She\u2019s the leader of this group.  She\u2019s a resident of Tokmok and after the death of her husband, she was left alone with her son. Unfortunately  the amount of her pension is too small for giving her son a quality education. So Makun had to go into business.  Four years ago, she took a loan to get her poultry-keeping business started. She became experienced in taking care of animals and decided to go on to the next level. She hopes to succeed in getting this loan and spend it on broadening her poultry business and purchasing a calf and hay.  If this brings her much income, she would like to get a cow also and start a dairy business. \r\n\r\nZeinep Y., 24, is a young entrepreneur. She is busy with selling vegetables and fruits at the market. So after gaining this loan, she plans to increase the commodity circulation of her business.\r\n\r\nRahima B., 50, has one 20-year-old daughter. Rahima is a dispatcher in the bus terminal of Tokmok. After a while, she decided that she could run a business at the same time. She bought livestock and gave it to her brother for breeding. Rahima applied to this loan for purchasing a calf and gaining as much profit from it as possible. \r\n\r\nRaliya Y., 47, is a teacher in high school. Raliya\u2019s husband is a welder and they are the proud parents of five children. She lives by the bus terminal and started a business in the market nearby. This loan she plans to spend on increasing her commodity circulation and opening a second small shop.  \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Luna's first loan from ASHI was for 5, 000 Philippine pesos (PHP) and this was used to raise goats. Though she already has this project, she never stops thinking about the future of her family. For her second loan from ASHI she wants to start selling fish in order to earned additional income. She needs capital amounting to 8,000 PHP. Her greatest dream in life is for all of her children to finish college and earn degrees so that they will find stable jobs and stable income. She wants her children to never experience what their parents have experienced under the slavery of poverty. She is very thankful to ASHI and to all the people who have been part of opening the door of opportunities to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":625012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"For a fish vending business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laua-an, Antique","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":124,"posted_date":"2010-10-25T04:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

is Teresita B., 45, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Fernando B., a technician, and is mother to a young working adult and a simple stay-at-home who manages the household while she attends to her business.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a photocopying business. There is more need now than before for services like these as customers\u2019 demands increase. Her main patrons are students, who require her services for school requirements. She also has people who need her photocopier for documents, form replication and other similar needs. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy a second hand Xerox machine, bond paper, toners, ink, and other supplies for her business. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy spare parts and repair fees for the photocopying machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

D. C., aged 54, is a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Harold D. C., a policeman, and is the mother of three children. By the grace of God, Irma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Irma as she herself has been a college graduate (she took up a Bachelor of Science in Nursing) and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nIrma maintains a direct selling business and a car-for-rent business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s cost prices are lower than those in the catalogue: the difference between the two is the profit that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Irma is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nIrma dreams of being able to give all her children a good high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

M. is from the village of Taboo, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from butchering and selling a variety of meats in the local community. Ireneo has been engaged in his business for over 28 years and earns approximately 12,800 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ireneo joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 50,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ireneo is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be the second loan that Ireneo has taken out from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to his house. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao.

She is 43 years old and a resident of Guinbanga-an, Laua-an, Antique, Philippines. She has four children; the oldest is 18 years old while the youngest is 11 years old. \r\n\r\nDue to poverty, her oldest child, John Webb, did not finish his elementary level, her second child is only in grade 6 while her third child as well as her youngest child are both in grade 3. Even though they are both industrious, they are still tied by poverty because they lack opportunities and resources. Her partner, Edwin, is a farmer while she is a laborer and housekeeper.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, ASHI came into Elizabeth's life. This was also the time when she started to open her eyes, broaden her mind and started dreaming of their future. After their training in ASHI, she received her first loan of PHP 5,000 which they invested in farming and it helped them to sustain their basic needs.\r\n\r\nFor her second loan from ASHI, she is borrowing PHP 8,500 and this amount will be utilized as starting capital for their buy-and-sell business dealing in muscovado sugar because their municipality (town) Laua-an is known as the muscovado capital of Antique. Muscovado is a type of unrefined brown sugar with a strong molasses flavor. Also known as \"Barbados sugar\" or \"moist sugar\", muscovado is very dark brown and slightly coarser and stickier than moist brown sugar. Muscovado takes its flavor and color from its source, sugar cane juice. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably long shelf life. It is commonly used in baking recipes and making whiskey. \r\n\r\nElizabeth has a simple dream in life which is to send her children to school until college and she believes that it is not too late to start again. She wishes that her membership in ASHI will help her dreams come

With the loan, her husband will buy a new donkey cart because the old cart has become rough and rotted in different parts which makes him unable to load items onto it and this is affecting his work. Shafqat is hopeful that her husband will successfully retain his customers by providing them good loading services.  \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Shafqat is the lady who is holding a book (called an

He\u2019s been engaged in this kind of business for twenty years already.

D. is from the village of Maribojoc, Tudela, Misamis Occidental.

She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $350 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Emma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. \r\n\r\nEmma is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which again will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be her 9th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to pay for services to increase her crop yield. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing and a fish-vending business. Her husband, Milo S., who is 39 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 5 to 17 years old. \r\n\r\nMary Jean joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Jean has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her increase her monthly profit to about $355, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to do maintenance work on her fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Mary Jean S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Kyrgyz Republic's economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation's economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan. While economic performance has improved in the last few years, difficulties remain in securing adequate fiscal revenues and providing a sufficient social safety net.\r\n\r\nBuvaisha K., 48, is from the southern small town Kadamjai. A mother of four children, she is an immunologist in a local doctor hospital. Her husband is busy with a private carting business. Their oldest daughter has left to Russia for work, the youngest goes to school. The business of raising cattle started, when Buvaisha\u2019s husband came back after hard work in Russia and invested earned money in this business.  Profits from raising cattle have helped them to buy a car, which became the next source of earning money.  With money received from this loan, Buvaisha wants to purchase six farm animals for breeding. In the near future, they plan to open a small shop in their village. \r\n\r\nBurul O., 37, has two daughters. Her husband is a mechanic and Burul is engaged in sewing national accessories. They also breed livestock to make money. The purpose of the loan is to purchase two units of livestock for breeding. \r\n\r\nSuksur A., 56, is married. Her husband is a security guard in a local combine. They have three daughters. The family owns a cow and two calves. The purpose of the loan is to increase the family's number of cattle. \r\n\r\nTilyakhan S., 39, is a nurse in a local hospital in Kadamjai. The purpose of the loan is to purchase a dairy cow.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is 39 years old. She has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Globena owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as sweet bananas, breads, and biscuits in the local community. Globena has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Globena joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Globena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Globena is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and build working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Globena from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She lives in Purok 5, Culipapa, Hinobaan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002, and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF, and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\nBy working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. Elisa is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Elisa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Moreta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks for her general store so that she could continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Moreta Ricabalnca is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating a Fish Vending  business.  Lilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past twelve loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy fishing nets so that she could continue to save up for future improvements of her business. Lilia B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Jovencia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jovencia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the  business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She sells beverages through a distribution center of the Bralima company (Primus beer, Fanta etc); later on, she received a loan of $50 from IMF Hekima, around 2008. She sells out of her home.

SaL. started a business renting laundry machines. In 2007 she sought to strengthen her business with a loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, as she was unable to meet customer demand with the two washing machines her husband had bought for that purpose.\r\n\r\nShe began her business to satisfy the needs of housewives regarding the reduction in effort and time savings of this tiring daily chore, particularly given the unrelenting sun of the Caribbean Coast where Elsy lives.\r\n\r\nShe has a tricycle she uses to transport her machines, a task in which she is assisted by her eldest daughter. With the income generated by this activity Elsy has been pursuing studies as a nursing assistant, perfected through graduate studies and updates, such as neonatal care and many other subjects.\r\n\r\nHer family consists of her husband, employed by a company, and their two daughters aged 15 and 10 years who are still in school. She dreams of seeing them become successful in their future careers.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan granted by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organisation that provided strong support, as it bolstered her working capital which contributed to Elsy\u2019s personal development as the business grew.\r\n\r\nUsing her Kiva loan she will buy two more washing machines to replace the ones bought previously, which have deteriorated to the point where they can no longer withstand the daily grind. \r\n\r\nAt 33 years of age, Elsy and her family are progressing in the same direction. While she and her husband work, their daughters study and help with the business and household tasks, so that one day they can have more opportunities for a successful life.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge is the limited working capital she depends on and that is needed for her business to continue moving forward.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":625265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery

He began his business after he dropped out of school; he believed this business could be a good source of income for him.

Her shop is open from 6.00am to 7.00pm and while she runs her business and does her housework, her daughter goes to school.  She learned to work because her father taught her and now Doris is very happy to have her own business since it has allowed her to have an income with which she can look after herself and her daughter and cover her household bills such as water and electricity. Her difficulty is that there are many businesses of the same type in the neighborhood and this means that sales drop.  Sometimes her daughter's school expenses are high and she has no way of paying them.\r\n\r\nDoris is requesting her loan because she is building her house and needs to buy materials such as wood, blocks and bags of cement, sand and iron rods.  She also needs to pay workmen.  With the support of the loan she hopes to be able to finish building her house bit by bit and, in the near future, be able to move into it.  Her goal is to work hard every day so that her daughter does not want for anything.  She would also like to save so that her daughter can go to university and become a professional.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and their two children (both adults). She said her most difficult challenge was to be raised without her parents in a family home. In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying working and cooking. She is part of the micro-finance program because she had the need to invest in her business when she found out about Esperanza and took it into her community almost 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nLucia is excited to be taking her 5th loan with Esperanza, and to lead the program structure in her community. She has had her business for around 10 years, starting after she sold some pigs she had raised. With the profits she started running her \"colmado\" (convenience store). She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy rice, flour and other foods. Her business is a \"Colmado\", a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food. Normally those \"colmado\"s are in the neighborhood, a short walking distance from any home. Lucia will use the profits to have a better life, after she can finish building her house, and could have a successful business and good savings.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican  clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town on the north coast where the economy depends on tourism. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

There, in the \"Geraldin Photography Studio\", she does what she likes best: use Photoshop, restore old photos, design, stamp and mount photos, and do all manner of other things that have to do with the art of professional photography.

Her main clients are the families who live in and around the neighborhood, as well as educational institutions from all over the city, for whom she makes ID cards, photographic memorabilia, photo printing, really everything that recalls a human being's pleasant or nostalgic moments in life. This is why she always pays close attention to dates of graduation, first Communions, and other social and family reunions that her clients invest in. Her greatest challenge is to buy a flash lighting system and umbrellas to give her photos higher quality; she could also use better printers and laminating machines. Her dream is to be able to travel with her daughters so that they can get to know all of Colombia and realize that their country is one of the most beautiful created by God.

He has a very traditional business:  he is dedicated to beekeeping, and also to buying pigs and cows to then sell in parts.  The animal is sacrificed, removing the skin, viscera, hooves and head, to later weigh and sell per pound.  Miguel initially dedicated himself to farming and raising livestock in the Montes de Mar\u00eda, where he learned the trade.  The situation he faced obligated him to leave his lands, to which he returned three years ago, but to instead tend to bees with some friends and to sell meats as he has a customer base in San Jacinto.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With part of the loan, he will buy pigs and cows, foods that homemakers use a great deal to prepare special dishes for this coming holiday season.  He will use the other part of the loan to buy materials for honey producing beehives, such as frames, sheets of wax, boxes, and roofs.  His dream, and that of his wife, is to educate their daughters who are currently 6 and 12 years old, so that they can have a successful future as professionals.  He would also like to continue growing his business until he earns enough to have his own house and for the well-being of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":625371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"Partially

Everyday they work together to get ahead. From a young age this hardworking woman has worked hard in search of a better future, and she's always helped her husband with the constant home expenses. One year ago she began studying cosmetology; six months ago she began working as a barber\/stylist and makeup artist. Even though she currently only services friends and acquaintances, she hopes to open her own beauty salon one day. She says that she likes her work a lot because it allows her to offer her services in the comfort of her own home. Her customers visit her because she has nearly all of the necessary tools to offer them a good service at a reasonable price. She also does laundry for her neighbors, who pay her regularly for her services. This is her first loan with MFP and she promises to make her payments punctually because she doesn't want to upset the people who have made the loan possible that will permit her to continue her business. She would also like to say that she likes the work of her group members because they're all very hard working and enterprising, just like her. Consuelo plans to invest the loan in the purchase of a hair dryer and other cosmetic implements that she needs to continue offering her comfortable beauty service to her clients; she hopes to keep progressing in that direction.

G. is from the Barangay of Lower Lamac, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental.  She is 50 years of age, married, and has three adult children. To make a living, she is presently engaged in the snack vending business, which she has done for six years. Aurora earns approximately PHP 5,000.00 a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Aurora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. An active member of PMPC under the PDP-LP Program, a microfinance program that reaches out the rural communities, she has repaid her previous loan amount of PHP 14,900.00 and is now requesting her fourth loan in the amount of PHP 10,000.00 to be used as additional capital for her store.  Aurora plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family, save for future use, make loan repayments, and pay for the insurance and possible business expansion.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While both members of the group receive an individual loan, each is responsible for paying back the loan of the other group member if she is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJoann is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, she owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising and selling hogs. She has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Joann joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used for personal purposes. She is now requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be Joann\u2019s 8th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children\u2019s tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and
