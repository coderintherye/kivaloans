Her oldest son is earning money in Russia.  Sayohat works at the Zumrad sanatorium which is widely known both in Tajikistan and outside its borders.  The job is permanent and Sayohat is busy there all week.  On the weekends, together with her husband Sayohat purchases and sells small, horned livestock at the markets.  Right now, livestock prices are acceptable and this is why sales are going well.

Zebo is an enterprising woman. She is married and has two children. Her husband is a taxi driver and his salary isn't stable, so sometimes debts would accumulate. To help her husband, Zebo decided to start her own business, designing and making national dresses for women. She began after her first child was born and started with a small machine she already owned. Now she has a small workshop and two employees that help her cover the demands of her clients. The good service and fine quality she offers has made her business grow into a small company. \r\n<p>\r\nZebo wants a loan of 4800 Somoni to buy materials and repair her sewing machine so she can fill her customer's orders. The loan will help her business grow and raise the quality of life for her family. Zebo sincerely thanks you for your help.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

A., 32 years old and living with his wife and four children, has dedicated himself to farming barley, wheat, corn, tomato and watermelon for more than 13 years. Shuhrat enjoys being a farmer and finds harvesting his crops especially gratifying. On the other hand, the most tedious part of farming is the preparation of land for planting and protecting crops from insects that could spoil his harvest. This is his first loan request from IMON International, and he will use the money to buy seeds and fertilizer for his plots. Shuhrat thanks all who are supporting him.   <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

married and has 4 children.  Together with her husband, she is involved in livestock feeding and sales in order to support their family.  She lives in a village where there is no work.  The main source of income is agriculture and money transfers from Russia.  Her oldest son sends some money home, but because of the economic crisis, he has not sent any money last two months.  Gulbahor sold a bull and planned to buy a dairy cow.  However, because the cow costs more than she expected, Gulbahor requested a loan from MicroInvest.  She learned about the lending terms and purchased a cow after receiving her loan.  Now she owns several dairy cows.  Gulbahor is grateful to Kiva for the support.         <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":325532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For purchase of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T05:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulbahor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":180.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994717,"comment":null},{"amount":20.82,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":90.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215946,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":90.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645424,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":90.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085042,"comment":null},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":90.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001266,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-01T07:37:17Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:36:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":111289,"name":"Iulia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iulia is potentially going to take a position as a farmer but she wants to begin producing something to take advantage of available tax deductions.

Primary School for Infants in Hastings requesting a group loan. The school was founded by the government to give pre-school education to the children of the Hastings community. There are currently 596 pupils and 13 staff.  Like many schools in Sierra Leone, R.E.C. Primary School for Infants lacks adequate classrooms, seating, and learning and teaching materials.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for the teachers from SMT\/Kiva. Because government salaries for teachers are usually very small, the SMT\/Kiva loans are very much helpful to these teachers. With these loans, some of the teachers will invest in a side business to supplement their teaching salaries.  Others will use it to buy pieces of furniture like a bed or chairs, buy a piece of land on which to build a house, or purchase building materials.  Others will use the loan to pay for college fees to pursue further studies, or school fees for their children.  Gradually, with their monthly salaries, these teachers will repay their loans.\r\n\r\nGifty M. N. (fifth from right) is the deputy head teacher of the R.E.C. Primary School for Infants. She was born in Hastings, about twenty-three miles from Freetown, which is the capital city of Sierra Leone.  She is single with four children.  One of her children is already an adult, two are in secondary school, and one is still in primary school.  She has been a teacher for 31 years now.

Mais il utilise les blocs de glace pour refroidir la boisson tel que souhait\u00e9 par sa client\u00e8le. Actuellement, son affaire produit $144 de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice par mois. Il esp\u00e8re faire plus que cela dans un proche avenir car son ambition est d\u2019ouvrir une chambre froide pour stocker des vivres frais pour des clients dans le but d\u2019accroitre le revenu. Godefroid est membre fid\u00e8le de l\u2019un des groupes de Hope RDC d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 \u00ab La Rose \u00bb depuis 2008. Il est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 42 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 4 enfants dont leurs \u00e2ges varient entre 2 et 12 ans. Deux d\u2019entre eux vont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. ","en":"Godefroid K. sells various goods, such as soap, canned foods, sugar, vegetable oil, school supplies, etc... in Kingasani, which is located on the north side of the city of Kinshasa and its most populated part.  He started the business by selling sweet beverages in 2001 with $20 in initial capital.  From 2001-2005, it was prosperous, enabling him to open a small general store. Through decisive effort and accumulated profits, he was able to amass $250 of working capital this year. \r\n\r\nGodefroid intends to use the loan of this May to buy merchandise to bolster his inventory in order to satisfy the needs of his customers for sugar and lollipops.  He's running into difficulties due to electric power outages occurring at awkward moments.  But he uses blocks of ice to cool his drinks just the way his customers like it.  Currently, his business produces $144 in profits a month.  He hopes to make more than that in the near future because his ambition is to open a cold room to store fresh foodstuff for customers with the goal of growing his revenues. \r\n\r\nGodefroid has been a member of a HOPE RDC group named \"La Rose\" since 2008.  He is 42 years old, married, and the father of four children, ranging in age from 2 to 12.  Two of them go to school. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

This has been a very successful business.  When Andrei originally intended to start his business he was skeptical because he did not have enough money to launch the business. He had just closed a lucrative soap shop temporarily to move to a new location. After finally signing the lease, not even two weeks before he was to open, the owners of the property told him that he could not sell jewelry there because his shop would be competing with a major new store that was opening soon. Andrei had two choices. He could either back out of the lease or continue with the lease with a different product mix. This was a very viable location and he did not want to let it go. Over the coming days Andrei had to come up with an idea that he could feel comfortable with in order to move forward. He already had the oils because he carried them in his soap shop, so he decided to renegotiate the lease for a small fragrance shop instead. He knows that this would turn out to be one of the best decisions of his life. Andrei borrowed from the Kiva partner, Microinvest, to pay for the original rental of the shop. Andrei is sure that he will succeed in his business and will return the loan in time to Microinvest.

","en":"Dionisia is 40 years old, the mother of four children, and a very hardworking woman. She lives in her own house with two of her daughters--Yulisa, 15, and Jerson, 11, who motivate her sacrifice and work. For the past five years, she has worked selling clothing like wool sweaters on Thursdays and Sundays in the fairs of Tarma city. She buys her merchandise in the city of Huancayo, where she can buy at a convenient price, which permits her to earn better profits. On the other days of the week, she works in her field. She enjoys this work a great deal. In order to reap a good harvest, she fertilizes her crops every season, and she uses a donkey to transport the fertilizers to her field. After fertilizing her seeds, she feeds the donkey until it is satisfied and thus prepares it to work again. During these years of working as a farmer and saleswoman, Dionisia has learned to take care of her plants as well as her customers.

Of those four, the youngest two still attend the local school. She and her husband work as day laborers on the small farms of their neighbors, and, in small quantities, harvest their own crops like potatoes, peas and yams. She sees it as her obligation to wake up at sun rise to have time to prepare food and starts her work usually at 8 a.m., where they pay her 12 soles a day and her husband 15. In this way they are able to feed their children. She cultivates her own crops only when she has time, so she only harvests them once every six to eight months. Meanwhile, she labors arduously on the fields she's hired to work on. <p>\r\nHowever, now the couple is proposing a change in their lives. They want to focus more on their own land and produce their crops in higher quantities and of top quality. Jovita really enjoys working in her fields, so one of her goals of progress is expanding them. This is her third loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she promises to keep working hard with the same energy she that has taken her to this point. She is very satisfied with her community bank, above all because it helps her save money. She plans to use the 1300 soles she is requesting to purchase chemical fertilizers to enrich her potato fields.

Mariela makes a living selling grocery products of primary need in a space she set up in her home. She rises at dawn every day and at the stroke of 6 a.m. it's possible to find her in her small bodega offering hot breads and smiling and conversing with her customers, which is what she most enjoys about her business. Mariela would like to enlarge her store in order to offer more convenience to her customers as well as increase the number of products she sells. But at the moment this is difficult due to the faltering economy, and furthermore she doesn't have sufficient space. She has had the business for five years and is very familiar with every one of her clients. She feels that now is the time to grow and improve her service in order to generate more income and with it a better quality of life.

He lives with his mother and 5 children.  Three of them migrated to other cities and now he is left with the 2 youngest.  They are the reason for his work.  He gets up very early to chop up the fire wood his wife uses to prepare their daily food and then he goes to do his farming chores.  He mainly grows potatoes.  He has learned the tricks of the trade in these years as a farmer so he doesn\u2019t lose anything in any of his crops.  Sometimes his production is reduced due to the poor soil from lack of fertilizers.  Santiago takes care to fertilize his plants as many times as needed to obtain abundant harvests since he has 5 hectares of land.  Now he has potatoes to harvest which he hopes to trade in the markets of Lima to gain a better profit.  He wants to increase and vary his crops by planting peas which he thinks are very profitable also.  Santiago is very happy with the work he does.  He plans to continue growing with his land in the future.  He has worked with MFP for three consecutive loans and has had no payment problems.  On the contrary, he cancelled his loan ahead of some due dates and he is committed to continue working in the same way for this loan cycle.   He will use the loan for one thousand five hundred PEN that he has applied for to purchase chemical fertilizers so he can fertilize during the months his crops need it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":325592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-29T13:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-29T19:07:01Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":111327,"name":"Magdalene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdalene is 43 years old and married with four children.

His shop, originated in 1988, really improved through 1990.  The pillaging in 1991 and 1993 in Kinshasa had carried off all the merchandise in his shop and cause his bankruptcy.  From 1998 to today, Patrice got reorganized, relaunching his shop once again.  For now, he is happy because his business is improving as he would like, despite some difficulties due to monetary depreciation.  \r\n\r\nHis general store includes canned foods, soaps, candles, toilet paper, milk, sugar, salt, etc... With the loan of this May, he has planned to bolster his stock of merchandise aiming to increase his revenues and to satisfy the needs of his ever-growing customer base.  His ambition is to open a store for men's and women's clothing.  The market is big in his district.  Currently, he totals up $300 in capital and his work generates a profit of $175 per month.  He has joined a HOPE RDC group in 2008 with the goal of realizing his dream \r\n\r\nPatrice is 47 years old, married, and the father of eight children, ranging in age from 17 to 32.  Three of them are on their own, and five live with Patrice and his wife and go to school.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

His day starts very early - by the time it's 8 a.m. he is already in the fields. Saul loves his work because he can see his efforts in his plants that will eventually be the harvest. Every year he has gotten very good yield and earnings. That's why he spends all of his efforts there, to produce large quantities of harvest. Sometimes his harvest suffers despite the use of fertilizers and pesticides, while other times he has enjoyed large harvests. Saul has an excellent harvest of potatoes and he has already gathered up many sacks full in his storage. Slowly he sells them, but before he shipped them all out to the market he decided to pose for the photo. This is his third loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). In the past loans he has not had any trouble paying them back and he hopes to keep up his record. He is a very happy client and his conversation always reveals his innate sense of joy, something that is very much appreciated by his colleagues in the community bank.

Santos is married, and is the father of 4 children; his eldest daughter is in secondary school, and three youngest are in primary school. With the income that his business generates he is able to take care of some household expenses and financial commitments. The loan that he is requesting is to purchase wood, which is the principal material used the in production of furniture. Because it is rainy season, it is difficult to acquire dry wood, this causes Santos to be unable to attend to his clientele, and consequently leads to a loss of time and income. He also counts on a mill where he offers milling services for nixtamalized corn, coffee, corn for flour, Nicaraguan tamales known as Nacatamales, and donut rings. Santos is well known in his neighborhood for being a helpful man with dreams of getting ahead of life. He mentioned to us that he will be very grateful for the loan that will be granted, and that he will in this way be able to get his household ahead in life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":325815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To purchase cedar, mahogany, laurel, and pine wood.

Mrs Rim C. is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice, and she needs fertilizer to make her crop more productive. \r\n<p>\r\nEighteen members in this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans. This means they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. (The rest have monthly payment loans.) EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. An EoT loan allows the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever he or she is financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Josephine is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase products to sell in her sari-sari (general store). This loan will be the first loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business for her children's education and for her family's basic needs.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

So she has come to ALID\u00e9 to have a loan so as to better serve her clients. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":326135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of four jerry cans of 25 liters of peanut oil and a sack of 50 kg of maize","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904387,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126420,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549847,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983638,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896007,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735587,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623098,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019804,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858298,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618458,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-27T23:11:16Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":111543,"name":"Bilquis Muhammad Ali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bilquis baji is the wife of M.

He began by selling flip-flops with an initail capital of US$ 5. From 1993-1997, he tried out various commercial activities, notably exchanging currencies, selling maize, and selling charcoal. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, he bought his first mill. At the end of two years and thanks to the profit from that mill, he was able to buy a second that he still uses today. His business is situated in a northern district, the most populous of Kinshasa. In vue of his growing clientele, J\u00e9r\u00f4me has planned to use this month-of-May loan to buy a third mill so as to further increase his earnings. Presently, his business is bringing in a profit of US$ 75 per week. <P>\r\n\r\nThe difficulty he encounters in his business is untimely power outages. J\u00e9r\u00f4me intends to buy a generator with later loans so as to be able to serve his clients at all times and thus earn more money. He is 43, married and father of 3 children, aged between 5 and 12. Only two are enrolled in school. He is a faithful member of one of the HOPE DRC groups named \"Abraham\". His dream is to open a real flour mill for the people living in his district.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Safina takes care of additional family members. There is electricity but no piped water at her home. The family gets three meals a day. She resides and works in a semi-urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. Safina operates a restaurant in Nakulabye, one of Kampala's suburbs. She sells to all kinds of customers, serving an average of 20 people a day. She works six days a week. Safina buys all the food she requires from Nakulabye market and doesn't pay extra for transportation to and from shopping. Her major monthly expenses are rent for the business premises and her residence. She has been in this business for the last two years. Her main challenge is the rainy season, which stops her customers from coming to her restaurant. Safina has been with MCDT for over two years and is requesting her fourth loan, working all this time with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more saucepans, plates, and cups.

They operate diverse businesses, including the sale of condiments, Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), fruit, and grains.  They are on their sixth collaboration with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to satisfy customer demand and to grow their revenues.  All of the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, they intend to buy thirty packages of condiments, thirty 100-kg sacks of grain, and 25 baskets of fruit.  Supplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of Sikasso City and in surrounding villages from producers.  The merchandise is sold retail in cash transactions at the grand marketplace of Sikasso City locally, out of the house, and door-to-door.  The customers are composed of women and men.  \r\n\r\nThe group members each envision realizing an average monthly profit of 20,000 francs CFA.  A portion will be used for the education and health of the children, and the other portion will be invested in business and used for making loan payments.
