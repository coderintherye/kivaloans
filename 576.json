Rosita is requesting a new loan of 22,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products, like blouses, t-shirts, shorts, and underwear. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Rosita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

I. is from the village of Dalirig, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon. She is 49 years old. Cynthia is widowed and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Cynthia owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling canned goods, snack foods, beverages, shampoo, soap & biscuits in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Cynthia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & fund working capital for her business. \r\n\r\nCynthia is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP to restock her inventory with products such as detergents & instant noodles. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to further improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

has been practicing mixed farming for the last fifteen years in Litein town in Rift Valley Kenya. He sells his products of maize, beans and milk to the local market. \r\n\r\nPhilip is 35 and married with five children aged between two and 10 years.

She lives in the area of Pampahasi Bajo, which is located twenty-five minutes from the center of town. Teresa is a seamstress at her sister in law's small business where they make girls' dresses and fleece jackets. She works in this place from 8:30 in the morning until 4:30 in the afternoon. After finishing her job as a seamstress she goes out to make her daily collections, since in addition to sewing, she also sells jewelry on credit. She has several customers in the Pampahasi area who order different types of jewelry from her, such as earrings, topos (broochs worn by Indigenous women) and hat ornaments. One of Teresa's greatest wishes is to be able to buy her own house since she and her whole family had to leave their previous house due to the landslides in the area and their house was lost. Now they are facing this painful fact and are getting ahead. She is very grateful to the institution for the support it has offered.

For over 8 years she\u2019s been selling home-made food.  She buys the ingredients she\u2019ll need in the morning and makes sure they are fresh perishables because she then sells in the afternoons.  At the end of the day she also sells fast-food items, like sandwiches, accompanied by hot beverages, like coffee, tea or herbal teas, according to the wishes of her customers. A lot of people come by and she\u2019s managed to secure customers among which are merchants from a local shopping center.  The advantage of her business is that sales are cash and profits are reflected at the end of each day.  In addition, on weekends she makes typical regional dishes that she sells in a tent erected on her doorstep.  She enjoys the work she does because it allows for better profits compared to other businesses she\u2019s tried in the past which failed.  Notwithstanding, her enthusiasm and desire to improve keep her in business.  Her future plans are to get a locale or snack bar in a school to prepare food for students and teachers.\r\n\r\nThis is her 19th loan with MFP and she is very happy to be part of her communal bank because she learned the value of savings and unity for which she is grateful and she will continue to be responsible and committed to her work.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy disposable containers and also some perishable and non-perishable ingredients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":746891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy perishables and non-perishables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-08T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":224.97},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":234.27},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":245.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":255.19},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":264.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":275.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.9},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.04},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":82.49,"local_amount":224.97,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":231.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196504,"comment":null},{"amount":85.9,"local_amount":234.27,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":241.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270182,"comment":null},{"amount":89.97,"local_amount":245.37,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":252.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550201,"comment":null},{"amount":93.57,"local_amount":255.19,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":262.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718878,"comment":null},{"amount":97.04,"local_amount":264.66,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":272.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350346,"comment":null},{"amount":101.03,"local_amount":275.54,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":283.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850839,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-08T19:00:47Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":288761,"name":"Nueva Iluci\u00f3n Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cNUEVA ILUCI\u00d3N\u201d iniciar\u00e1 su ciclo decimo tercero en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Santiago II.

She has operated her walking store for over 2 years and her loans have allowed her to increase her business. She plans to use this loan to improve her inventory, by buying 12 pairs of shoes, 6 blouses and some pants. \r\n\r\nShe has successfully repaid her first loans and this will be her second one with Esperanza. Leandra has two grown children and they live together with their father, Leandra's long-term partner. She wants to continue to increase her business to help her children to become professionals.\r\n\r\nLeandra is the group coordinator of her group Mujeres Activas (Active Women) 4.

He lives in his own house in the rural part of Morrope District, a district populated by humble, hard working people dedicated to farming.  It\u2019s located in Lambayeque Province over forty minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  His community is small; it has approximately 100 families.  It has both electricity and running water.\r\n\r\nFor over 20 years he has earned his living raising small farm animals to sell.  He feeds them grains and natural grasses and when they reach a good level of development he sells them to merchants that visit his area frequently.  He carries out these activities on a piece of property near his house.  He learned this line of work from his parents which is to say, he knows it to perfection. In addition, he earns extra income providing public transportation services with a mototaxi that he owns. \r\n\r\nHis house is currently in a deteriorated state.  Because of this he wants to use the loan to do some interior repairs.  With this investment he will be able to do some home repairs that will improve his family\u2019s quality of life.  He has, therefore, thought it convenient to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a 1500 new sol loan.

She eventually diversified into other areas through training as an apprentice in the national service corps, a free State technical institution in Colombia.  Her insistence on perfection have allowed her to improve the quality of her products and perfect her art forms.  Now she participates in various expositions and fairs, where she exhibits her products near the competition and wins customers.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Con este pr\u00e9stamo, Hugo no tendr\u00e1 que recurrir a prestamistas informales los cuales le cobrar\u00edan tasas alt\u00edsimas.

He lives in his own house with his brother in the Olmos district, a rural area with a good commercial activity located in the Lambayeque province and at more than an hour and a half form the city of Chiclayo. For all of his life, Hugo has engaged in breeding and selling livestock such as cattle, goats and sheep. This activity is his main source of income for his everyday necessities. As his house is currently in a dilapidated state, he wishes to use his credit to make some repairs in his house, thus improving his living conditions. For this reason he has thought it convenient to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 700 PEN. Thanks to this loan, Hugo will not have to turn to informal loan sharks that would ask for very high interest rates. Edpyme grants him his loan at a lower interest rate than other banks and loan sharks. This will enable Hugo to work comfortably without risking his daily liquidity.
