A. is 44 years of age and resides at Southern Looc, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.  She is married with 3 children, 2 in high scool and 1 in elementary school. Fishing and fish selling is their prime source of income. They bring their catch to markets, to the neighborhood and sometimes walk to the different establishments just to make sure of an income.  Adelita works hard for the family.  She also does laundry for friends and sometimes for prominent households.  Meeting the daily challenges in life is hard to survive.  But to the A. family, these can't pull them down.  Recently Adelita applied for PHP 20,000 loan for purchase of additional fishing nets and hopefully to acquire a lot to start a home of their own.  The 7 loans she made to Paglaum MPC were promptly paid.  She said that Paglaum helped a lot in uplifting their lives.<p>\r\n\r\nShe dreams of sending her children to college.

Biasong, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental, Marilyn L. is running a good pottery business.  She is married with 4 children; 3 are already working and one is still in college.  Marilyn has never focused only on pottery; she wants to try another business for additional income. She is considering a fishing business.  Aside from fishing, she has embraced the idea of fishnet making and buying and selling \"lahoy\" (shark).  She believes these businesses will supplement her living. <P>\r\n\r\nJust like pottery, the other businesses are also fragile.  They are so delicate that Marilyn makes it a point to handle them with much care. One wrong move will surely bring the business down.  But she is thankful to Paglaum MPC for helping her out, not only with capital but also with training in micro-entrepreneurship.  This PHP 20,000 she has applied for will be used for the repair of their sailboat and purchase of additional fishing accessories.<P>\r\n\r\nShe hopes to help the community by employing  someone to help them with fishing.

She has been running the business for over one year and  offers her customer excellent service. Josephine tries to make her pub stand out from the others in her locality by offering free DSTV and GTV entertainment to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis business can at times be frustrating. Josephine has to deal with clients who walk away drunk without paying their bills and those who get chaotic and end up breaking glass ware. This though, has not hampered her from expanding her business. She is using the loan proceeds to purchase more local brands of alcohol such as Nile, Bell, Tusker, Waragi, Romi, among others. She is saving some of the profits earned so that she can purchase a pool table for the pub to attract more customers and increase her income. She is more than determined to see her niece through all levels of

To be able to make ends meet, she has been making a living by baking and selling bread for the past two years. Being that she is so young, she has always wanted to work toward a better future, which is why she decided to start the bakery. She works from approximately 5-7 a.m. baking the bread, which she then distributes to various stores. The most difficult part about her job is making the bread, since she bakes with her home oven and the temperature can get quite excessive. However, Yesenia knows that the only way to make progress is to keep working very hard, and that's why she looks to improve from day to day. This is her first loan with Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma.

She is 63 years old, and has a grown-up son who works and helps her.  Magda works as a craftswoman, and receives a retirement pension as well.  She has been making crafts for 5 years, which she began with her own money.  Now her difficulty is that she cannot work full time because her hand hurt and cannot continue working until the pain passes.  This loan will be the seventh that she has received from Afodenic, with which she has been able to improve her home.  With this loan she wishes to revamp the front of her house, as one part is covered in zinc, and she would like to make it a little safer from the local criminals.

When she was twenty-five she got married, and in the same year started a business selling cattle to the slaughterhouses of Maputo.  In 2005 she left this type of business, because she says to procure the cattle she had to travel a lot, without anyone to take care of her children.

She's 55 years old and didn't have the opportunity to go to school because her parents could not afford it.  She is married and the mother of eight children between 25 and 45 years old, all married.\r\n\r\nMaria left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the frontier with Swaziland, with her husband who was in the service of the civil police.  Once in Namaacha, she started working in Macuacua, a place in the same district.  She decided to raise guinea fowl, as this is an appropriate zone for this activity, and to sell them in town.  With the funds she made, and with the help of her husband, they bought a car, which allowed them to expand their business even further.  Besides chickens, they also began to sell charcoal in the city of Maputo.  But because of the war, Maria lost all her goods and moved to town, where she continues her enterprise, but with a lot of difficulty.  Today she raises chickens at home.  She has bought at most 2 x 100 cases of chicks at 14000 meticais and resold each at 85 meticais.  She has had a profit of 3000 meticais monthly and manages to save 1000 per month, because she has to pay the expenses of her grandchildren, who are in school.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second of Maria's loans with Hluvuku, and the first with Kiva.  The first, of 8000 meticais, she used to buy chicks.  She was able to repay it without a single difficulty and now is applying for this second one of 10000 meticais to strengthen her business.  She's confident that she will repay ahead of time and request another loan to renovate her stall.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

This group is specialized in making and selling \"sounbala\", a highly-appreciated food product that is sought after for making sauces in West Africa. \r\n<p>\r\nThey learned how to make sounbala at an early age from their mothers.  In other words, it's about an ancient body of knowledge passed down from generation to generation.  Basically, the n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds, once they are properly cleaned, are boiled, pounded, and then kneaded in order to make a dark, edible dough called 'sounbala', which is formed into several different shape. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members are on their fourth loan with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  The women are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs CFA each to buy 600 kg of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (the fruit of an oil-producing tree in the Sahel region) and firewood for cooking the seeds. \r\n<p>\r\nThe production cycle and actual sales occur over the course of three weeks.  The finished sounbala is taken to Bamako and often to Senegal to be sold in cash and often on credit.  The group members hope to realize an average per-cycle profit of 33,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to boost their working capital.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":233518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou Koulikoro,","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":202104.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889518,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440301,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135674,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033475,"comment":null},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620842,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-03T17:32:32Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":77563,"name":"Pov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Pov C. is a 48-year-old who lives in Trapaing Thnaut village in Takeo Province.

She started this business three years ago, and she works on a daily basis from 8:30 am until 7 pm. By doing so, she is able to earn a monthly profit of approximately $184. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first loan Grace has sought via Tujijenge Tanzania. With the loan proceeds, she hopes to buy more inventory for her shop, such as ladies' suits and clothes for the Christmas sales season.

Her greatest difficulty in life was having a partner who was abusive.  This resulted in their separation and Julia having to start a new life with her four children.  Her greatest accomplishment has been to rise above this by starting her own business and building her own home.  She tells us that she is happy these days because her business, where she sells wigs, gifts, and cell phones, is doing so well.  She also tells us that her business, which she began with the equivalent of only $25 USD, has grown a great deal thanks to the first loan she obtained through the Manuela Ramos Group.  At this point she has been able to invest $15,900 USD in her store and merchandise.  With this loan of $975, which she will pay back in four installments, she will purchase games and toys for the Christmas season.
