But this hardworking woman's favorite activity are the beautiful crafts she makes, such as angels, plush toys and dolls.  She makes them from corrospun (a type of plastic), craft foam, fabric and ribbon.  She says she sells a half-dozen angels for an average of 40 soles, which gives her a profit of more than 50% over the amount she invested in making them; but in this summer season, Ana is also offering classes to children and teenagers who want to learn to make crafts, where they can let their imaginations soar.  Imagination is a key quality for this business which, in Ana's own words, \"is her hobby.\"  Ana wants to open a craft school year-round.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP, and she says she is grateful for the support she has received all this time from her communal bank, which celebrates its members' birthdays at every meeting.

She works selling clothing, shoes, perfume, small electrical appliances, and handicrafts. She buys these items in San Jacinto, a picturesque town located in the center of the department of Bol\u00edvar, which is famous for its hats, bags, and hammocks. \r\n\r\nGleidis inherited the business from her mother, a veteran saleswoman who had to retire because of health problems. Her customers are renowned and she has kept them coming back for more than ten years. Initially she had some problems with customers making late payments but then she got more selective and started choosing those customers who paid her the best. Today she is proud to report that she no longer has any trouble securing payment.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan that she has received through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She plans to use the funds to purchase jeans, shirts, pants, and handicrafts. The previous loan that she received was for 1,000,000.00 Colombian pesos. Robbers stole the entire loan from her just as she was getting ready to travel to San Jacinto. This took an emotional and economic toll on her but with the help of a few friends, she was able to pay off the debt and fund her business. However, she confesses that she had to make drastic cuts to her household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer average monthly sales total 1,400,000.00 Colombian pesos and her profit margin is 35%. She gives her customers 45 to 60 days to pay her. Gleidis is optimistic about the future because February is when the Barranquilla carnival begins. This is the most important folk music festival in Colombia and the demand for hats and bags increases considerably."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":681254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

The group is made up of 8 members and is directed by a board, the head of which is a president. The members of the community bank have various businesses; bread sales, clothing sales, wool,  rug braiding, a store, woven sweaters, baby clothing sales, and the sale and production of pastries. Rosa, the community bank president, says that she has been part of the Estrellas de Mayo group for two cycles, approximately one year. She is a married mother of two children. She has a neighbourhood store in her own home. Given the schedule required to tend to a neighbourhood store, from very early to very late, her children help her.

It is made up of eleven members and directed by a board made up of a president, treasurer and a secretary. The members have various businesses: a carpentry workshop, clothing sales, a filming service, jacket-making, dessert sales, a store, jacket-making, rug making, Yanbal products promoter and salesperson, detergent sales, and pita-making. Dora, the community bank president, is a married mother of two children. She has had a business where she films social events. Her husband supports her, and when there is great demand a family friend helps out. Her husband works as a news cameraman, and his knowledge led to this business. They film social events such as marriages, baptisms and ch'allas. They also travel to villages near to the El Alto city. The loan that she is now requesting will be used for the purchase of a camera and a photo printer. Dora is happy to have encountered Pro Mujer, as she has obtained this loan with few requirements. She feels that there is confidence between the members of the group and Pro Mujer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":681312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","use":"the purchase of a camera and photo printer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-12-30T02:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anahi Belinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":17676.75,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1766.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.02},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.01},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.01},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":255.02,"local_amount":1767.78,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1785.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191485302,"comment":null},{"amount":510.03,"local_amount":3535.56,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3570.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912151,"comment":null},{"amount":510.03,"local_amount":3535.56,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-22T08:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3570.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202161112,"comment":null},{"amount":510.03,"local_amount":3535.56,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3570.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206221249,"comment":null},{"amount":764.89,"local_amount":5302.29,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5354.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211296416,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-30T07:36:50Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262098,"name":"Ros","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ros S., 61, is from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of products in the local community.  Oldalia has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Oldalia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Oldalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20000 PHP from GDMPC.  This previous loan was used to coconut shells. Oldalia is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This loan will be the third loan taken out by Oldalia from GDMPC.

M. is from the village of Cagay-anon, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental. She is 43 years old. Evelyn is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Evelyn owns and operates a business venture in the agricultural sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Evelyn joined Kiva's partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to buy additional capital for her business. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase seedlings and fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Evelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

His in-laws pulled him into the business just as the technology was changing and the industry was growing.  Mark worked for the family business for a while and then started another business with a friend.  When the economy tanked, he decided to reduce his overhead costs and open his own business, Floppy Hat Pool Service.  He has had some of the same customers the entire time he has been in the pool business.  At the moment he has 70 different clients that he goes to regularly and has had as many as 108.  He is the only employee, so his 70 clients keep him extremely busy.  He is looking to hire another employee starting in April because he is expecting to have more customers in the high season.\r\n\r\nMark found out about ACCION Texas-Louisiana through a small business development advisor who had helped him with business issues in the past.  Mark had set a hard date to open Floppy Hat, whether he had a loan or not.  When he got in touch with ACCION, he told his loan officer that he was working with a short time frame.  He was grateful for the guidance from ACCION and was ecstatic when he received the loan before opening the business.  The loan gave him the working capital to allow Floppy Hat to take off.  Mark was able to go straight to his distributor and buy products to sell to his clients.  He was also able to pay for basic operating costs such as his insurance and worker\u2019s compensation.  \r\n\r\nMark describes himself as a workaholic, but hopes to have someone working under him in the future.  He wants to have more time for other things.  He would love to be able to spend more time with his four grandchildren and to play his trombone.  \r\n\r\nMark believes it is important to watch overhead costs and to only spend the money that the small business has.  Mark\u2019s motto is that \u201chard work never hurt anybody.\u201d  He enjoys working hard and seeing how all that hard work pays off.

She has a long term partner and is a mother with 7 children, all living with her in a simple structure home, in a rural villa of San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activity here is the free trading zone, a cement factory, and other businesses. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity. \r\n\r\nCatalina has been operating clothing sales for aproximately 10 years. She saved a small amount of capital and started her business. She plans to use this loan to buy jeans, shirts, underwear and other clothing pieces for both men and women. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business, like her other eight loans. She wants to have a successful business with employees. This is currently her most difficult challenge and her goal.

He has worked hard in this business and thanks to his hard work his customer base and income are stable. With the earnings that he has obtained from this business, he decided to venture into selling women's shoes, as there are few such businesses in the area.

In order to do so he has needed to request a loan of 2000 soles from Edpyme Alternativa. This will contribute to the achievement of his goal.
