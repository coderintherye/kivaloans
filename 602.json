In previous loan years, she has maintained a good credit behavior and never missed any meetings. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady raising a hand is Shameem.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1234.2,"image":{"id":776757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy inventory for a grocery store business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-05-26T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shameem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parveen Kosar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ishrat ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasreen Akhtar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shahida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tahira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":128000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11702},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10980}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.13,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452978,"comment":null},{"amount":137.14,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616933,"comment":null},{"amount":137.13,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226986062,"comment":null},{"amount":137.13,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744907,"comment":null},{"amount":137.13,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549392,"comment":null},{"amount":137.14,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244508189,"comment":null},{"amount":137.13,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715865,"comment":null},{"amount":137.13,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118766,"comment":null},{"amount":137.14,"local_amount":11702,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":11835.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243802,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-03T21:25:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":301581,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribel is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a tailoring business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 27,000 through NWTF to buy cloth and other materials for her tailoring business.\r\n\r\nMaribel has been in this business for 10 years.

She would like a loan of Le 3,000,000 to help her buy more food stuffs for her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 200,000. In the future, Kadiatu plans to embark on an international business and educate her children to university level. The current inflation level is her major business challenge. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":776802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more foods to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-05-26T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":507499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211175345,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":507500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216458184,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":507499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221796930,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":507499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226991296,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":507500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232750422,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":507499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239736463,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T20:57:54Z","paid_date":"2011-11-23T08:49:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":301605,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nilda is a farmer working in Banga, South Cotabato.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is from the village of Tup-on, Gingoog City. She is 57 years old. Asteria is married and has 8 adult-aged children. To make a living, Asteria owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling coconuts for copras in the local community. Asteria has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Asteria joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Asteria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. Asteria is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional coconuts for copras, as well as charcoal. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Asteria from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is from the village of Sta. Ines, Talisayan, Misamis Oriental. He is 57 years old. Jesus is married and has 7 adult-aged children. To make a living, Jesus owns and operates a tailoring business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing general  alteration and tailoring services to local community members. Jesus has been engaged in his business for over 16 years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Jesus joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jesus has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional tailoring equipment, such as needles and threads. Jesus is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Jesus from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is from the village of South Poblacion, Medina, Misamis Oriental. She is 53 years old, married, and has two adult children. To make a living, Lydia owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, snack foods, detergents, shampoo, soap, and beverages in the local community. Lydia has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lydia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lydia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Lydia is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, candies, and snack foods. This loan will be Lydia's fifth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She explains that she has been in this business for two years. Her main business challenge is dealing with customers who do not want to pay on time after they purchase clothes on credit. In addition, she does not have a proper shelter from which to sell her goods. She also receives income from the government's child support grant.\r\n\r\nSithembile requested this loan through Women\u2019s Development Businesses (WDB) and Kiva to buy clothes for resale. She says that the loan will help her generate profit and improve life for her and her children. She will use the extra income to help take care of her family. In the future, she sees her business growing.

They are 38 years old on average and have 5 children.  These women reside in the town of Bougouni, in the H\u00e8r\u00e8makono-North neighborhood, of the Sikasso region of the Republic of Mali.  These clients met one another through traditional relationships and marriages.  In order to consolidate their relationship, they started revenue-making businesses.  With the intention of growing their sales and better satisfying their clients, they joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance credit institution.  They are on their fifth group loan, with previous loans not being subject to poor repayment.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.

She has lived in the house of her in in-laws for 25 years.  The house is in one of the liveliest and friendliest neighborhoods of the city where traditional street music frames the everyday life of the inhabitants.  It was there, 7 years ago, that Mireya decided to set up her business selling the kinds of products that her neighbors wanted.  Before that, she helped her sister run a similar business buying products from catalogs and reselling them.  When Mireya struck out on her own, she knew her market and how to run a business.  She sold products that she bought from catalogs and was eventually put in charge of a sales team.  She was a successful leader and received prizes for her management of the team.  She sold cosmetics, decorative products and even small appliances, as well as clothing and footwear.  The earnings from the business have provided her with an independent income.  Mireya normally sells on credit and she can't always stretch her income to cover new orders, so she's applying to Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for a loan, her third, so that has the working capital she needs to support the business.  She will buy herbal medicines, beauty products and clothing, taking advantage of discounts so that she can pass the savings along to her own customers.  Mireya's goal is to buy a house of her own.  She also wants to provide her children with good educations so that they can be successful in the future.  Prior loans have helped Mireya strengthen her business and become more independent.

community called Tierra Blanca which is better known as 'La Novia del Sol' (The Sun's Bride).  It is noted for being an area where sugarcane is grown and also for the intense heat it experiences in the summer when temperatures reach 54\u00b0C  (129\u00b0F).  Reyna is 47 years old and has an elementary school level of education.  She is married and has three children (two daughters and one son).  Currently, only her youngest daughter Barbara is still in school.  She is 17 years old and in high school.\r\n\r\nReyna tells us that some years ago she and her husband built some rooms in the area outside their home which they rent out.  She tells us that a few years ago some gentlemen came to live in these rental rooms.  The men came from different States and worked for Barcel.

is 55 year-old Dhankumari.  She is married and has two children ages 34 and 32.  In 2000, she established her vegetable farming business.  Working 7 days a week and 4 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buys seeds and fertilizers.  In the future, Dhankumari plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

In 2000, she established  her vegetable farming business.  Working seven days a week and four hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy seeds and fertilizers.  In the future, Manju plans to raise the economic conditions of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Chandradevi has already received and successfully repaid a loan from Patan BPW and used the funds to buy pieces of wood and lumber for her business.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Chandradevi plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support.    \r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way. Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture. With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets. With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":318.75,"image":{"id":777636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Chappagaun","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T07:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cherimai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216573592,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743299,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594760,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T08:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265706,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691500,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647865,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250864998,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257274982,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2567.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-20T08:00:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302006,"name":"Mour","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Mour is a policeman who currently lives in Siem Reap province.

is 60-year-old Ankeldevi.  She is married and has two children aged 38 and 30.  In 1999, she established  her poultry farming business.  Working seven days a week and four hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy small chickens.  In the future, Ankeldevi plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, raising poultry for eggs and meat is a very profitable business.  Kiva loans are used to purchase chicks, food, and necessary medicine to keep the chickens healthy.  Once matured, the chickens are sold at small butcher shops or in the many open air markets throughout the valley.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

is from Oro Vista Village, Cagayan de Oro City.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling yellow bananas, papaya, mangoes and Chinese melon in the local community. Renante has been engaged in his business for over 14 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Renante joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. Renante is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional stocks of fruits like watermelons and bananas. This will be the fourth loan that Renante has taken out from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling hard boiled duck eggs or balot in the local community. Marceline has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marceline joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Marceline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. This was used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. Marceline is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed like raw duck eggs. This will be the fifth loan that Marceline has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

is from the village of Agora, Lapasan, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 26 years old, is married and has two infant children. To make a living, Cristina owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling chicken and duck eggs in the local community. Cristina has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cristina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This was used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. Cristina is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional chicken and duck eggs. This will be the fourth loan that Cristina has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Rosie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Rosie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from HSPFI. This was used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. Rosie is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional junk food, charcoal and bananas. This will be the seventh loan that Rosie has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
