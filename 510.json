Suay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running two businesses:  a general store and a fishing operation. Her husband Arnolfo, who is 37, works as a carpenter and also helps his wife. They have two children who are 8 and 11 years old. \r\n\r\nBetty joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she wanted a better life for her family. With the help of her six previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Betty has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her last loan, which was for PHP 23,000, helped her increase her profits to PHP 15,000 a month, and that meant a significant improvement in her family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000 to invest in her fishing business and general store so that she can continue to save for her children's education. Betty J. is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Ruslan is married, and his spouse is an office manager for a local medical college. This couple has worked hard, and it has given them fruits. They have managed to broaden the business and purchase some furnishings. This loan is needed for adding cell phone accessories to his assortment of goods.

Love D., 34, believes life to be so. Love reached college and is married to Richard; together, they have three children, two of whom are in elementary school, while the third one is not yet of school age.  They presently live in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nLove is in the direct--sales business. She sells silver accessories like necklaces, earrings, and rings to friends, neighbors, and business connections. Being eight years in business, Love uses knowledge based on experience and applies her learning from training in CCT* to make her business grow. Every month she earns around Php 8,250.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She intends to use this money to buy more silver accessories as well as products from the well-known beauty brand AVON in order to give her customers more options. She will also use the money to be able to deliver new orders to customers as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Love faces is that she cannot immediately get new orders and deliver them to customers since many of them do not pay their bill as soon as they get their previously ordered items. She then does not have sufficient money on hand to obtain new orders. However, Love finds ways to solve the problem and to make sure that finances in her business flow smoothly. Focusing on the silver lining of every cloud that comes her way, Love is determined to get a commercial space for her business. She continually prays for God's intervention in her life and in the life of her family, so that her children will be able to finish college and have a bright future.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance

Tampalon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a food vending business.  Her husband Hansel S., who is 29 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is three years old.\r\n\r\n Charity joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Charity has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and support her children's education.  \r\n\r\nCharity S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Caleb V., who is 48 years old, helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 19. \r\n\r\nRisalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Risalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her son's education. \r\n\r\nRisalie V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns her living by operating one  business venture: a charcoal and firewood sales business.  Her husband Rogelio, who is 55 years old, works as a truck driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 20 to 32 years old.\r\n\r\n Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to buy additional stock of charcoal and firewood to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\n Erlinda E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have 3 children who are currently going to school and are between 5 to 9 years old. \r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use as additional funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future home improvements. \r\n\r\n Rosalie D. T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Prk. 5, Brgy. Aguisan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her General Store, Rice Dealer and Hog raising businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 16,000.  Arlene is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she  can  purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 27,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Arlene aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ma. Luisa L., or \"Isay\" as she is known to her friends, knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Ma. Luisa, 49, reached high school and is married to Bernardino, a civilian guard. Together they are raising five children, of whom two are in high school, two are in college, and the other one already working.  Together, they live in GMA, Cavite, Philippines.\r\n\r\nMa. Luisa presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store, in which she sells items that are needed daily by neighbors in her community. Products on her shelves range from soap bars to candies and energy drinks to rice. Also, she has an alkaline water making machine with which she adds to the income of the family. Having been at least ten years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most importantly, her customers. Monthly she is able to earn an average of Php 10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. She also plans to charge up her alkaline water business so that it will also become profitable. Ma. Luisa plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.\r\n\r\nMa. Luisa's life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":659612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of more products for the store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-12-07T18:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":335.42,"local_amount":14583.31,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":14681.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652866,"comment":null},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":6250.04,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6291.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396021,"comment":null},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":10416.6,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10486.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814131,"comment":null},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":10416.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10486.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256696,"comment":null},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":8333.4,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8389.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-24T20:02:08Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":255613,"name":"Gbampo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo are members of the \u201cGbampo\u201d group.

He lives in his own house in the Dallan neighborhood, San prefecture. He has been in the buisness of selling cereal for 30 years now, and he has been working for himself at the grand market of San for 20 years. Amadou is very much in demand during the weekly fairs in San and the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nTo increase his business, he decided to turn to micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. He is on his third personal loan. Mr. Amadou K. plans to buy 4 tons of husked rice, 2 tons of pearl millet, 3.5 tons of millet and 2 tons of beans. He obtains his supplies from the wholesalers in San, but with this increase in his capital, he plans to buy directly from the producers. \r\n\r\nHe sells everyday at the  grand market in San and at the weekly fairs to customers who are both men and women, on credit  or in cash. He hopes to make a monthly profit of 130,000 CFA francs which he plans to use to repay the loan, pay for his children's schooling, buy food and and invest the rest in other income-producing activities. His goal is to ask for a bigger loan which will allow him to expand his business, increase his turnover and improve his quality of life.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Philip is a home inspector running his own business, F. Home Inspections. He inspects the condition of homes, checking for electrical, structural, or any other problem.  He also inspects for insects. \u201cI have a pest control business license and I want to expand that side of my business. In a non-conventional way.\u201d  With the rise of bedbugs across the country, Philip sees a real need for these services. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming an epidemic.  \u2026To be able to do an inspection of a house with a canine will be very valuable.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the worst parts about bedbugs is the psychological impact. \u201cIt really messes with people\u2019s heads,\u201d and bedbugs are very hard to find. \u201cOn a typical inspection you have to pull carpets back, look at small crevices \u2013 you can\u2019t really find them.\u201d  That\u2019s why Philip says inspections with a dog work well. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t find them, now the customers have the assurance that they\u2019re not there.  And that\u2019s providing another service, beyond finding it.  It\u2019s peace of mind when you don\u2019t find it.\u201d \r\n\r\nPhilip F. comes from a construction family \u2013 his father was a builder and his mother, a realtor.  For a few years Philip would buy houses to live in, rehabilitate them and then sell them. \u201cEverything leads me back to construction.\u201d In 2003, he went into business as a home inspector and opened his business.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge Philip has faced in recent years has been the slowdown in the economy and especially the housing market. \u201cBut our business has grown even in this declining market.  And I know the reason why. If you provide a service above what clients expect at a price less than they expect to pay, they\u2019ll recommend you.  \u2026it\u2019s a win-win.  Everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, Philip relies on savings to some extent.  \u201cOur business generates significant income, but it\u2019s cyclical.  People don\u2019t move as much during the holidays, so they don\u2019t inspect homes as much.  \u2026You never know, being an independent business \u2013 there\u2019s no guaranteed paychecks.  So you tend to be conservative when the market\u2019s slower.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip has been planning on getting an insect detection dog for about 18 months.  He first approached his bank. \u201cThey declined my loan.  After I applied to ACCION Texas-Louisiana, the bank reconsidered and offered me a loan, but I turned them down.  Because I was already set to close with ACCION.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis loan will cover part of the cost of the dog and Philip\u2019s expenses while going through handler training.  \u201cIt takes two weeks for them to train you, so I have to pay for hotels while that\u2019s happening.\u201d  Philip will pay for the rest out of his savings. \u201cI will use the loan to bridge that gap.  I don\u2019t get the dog until March, which is when business picks up.  That\u2019s when most people start to move and house hunt.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip is providing for his wife, two young sons and two step-daughters with this business.  Another reason why he wants to expand the business is because \u201ceventually everyone has to retire.  In order to do that you need to generate passive income. Hopefully these two businesses will provide that for me and my family.  \u2026When you get to be 60 years old you don\u2019t want to be on a second-story roof, 80 feet in the air.  And then if my sons want to go into this business, they can do that.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip advises other business owners that \u201cyou just have to take a chance.  You have to take a risk.  That\u2019s what\u2019s so cool about Kiva \u2013 there\u2019s so many diverse people trying to take a chance. And I want to be part of that.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip has been very excited to discover Kiva.  Since learning about it through his loan application, he has made two loans to other Kiva borrowers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3971.43,"image":{"id":654581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Termite

Al principio su clientela era peque\u00f1a, pero con el paso del tiempo fue creciendo entre amigos, vecinos, empleados de varias empresas y referidos. La se\u00f1ora Juana manifiesta ser una experta cazadora de ofertas que siempre est\u00e1 pendiente de los remates que realizan los almacenes de cadena. De \u00e9sta forma logra comprar art\u00edculos de primera calidad a excelentes precios. Usualmente los productos los vende para que se los cancelen en dos o tres partidas. Este es el segundo cr\u00e9dito que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y su primer Credikiva que planea invertir en la compra de jeans, blusas, calzado, colonias, perfumes y accesorios femeninos. El volumen promedio mensual de venta es de $ 1.200.000 COP  y su margen promedio de utilidad es del 35%. La se\u00f1ora Juana vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su hija menor, que es soltera y labora en una importante empresa de la ciudad desde hace 10 a\u00f1os. Se declara una mujer feliz que est\u00e1 pr\u00f3xima a pensionarse y disfruta mucho su trabajo porque le permite mantenerse activa, visitar con frecuencia a sus amigas y generar unos importantes ingresos  a la econom\u00eda familiar. El intenso invierno que ha soportado en los \u00faltimos meses el pa\u00eds ha afectado las ventas, pero espera recuperarse con la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o.","en":"Mrs Juana Ester Ben\u00edtez P. is a cheerful woman who lives in El Prado neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  This neighborhood is one of the most traditional and beautiful in Colombia.  For this reason, it was named a national architectural heritage site by the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\nJuana worked for many years as a secretary but gave up her job to work as a retailer of women's  products.  At first she didn't have many customers but, over time, her business has grown amongst friends, neighbors, employees of several companies and people who she has been recommended to.\r\n\r\nJuana is an excellent offer hunter.  She is always on the look out for sales that chain stores offer.  In this way, she manages to buy high-quality articles at excellent prices.  She usually sells her products to her customers and allows them to make two or three payments.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan that Juana has had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to invest it in buying jeans, blouses, footwear, aftershave, perfume and women's accessories.  Her average monthly sales volume is 1,200,000 Colombian pesos and her average profit margin is 35%.\r\n\r\nJuana lives with her youngest daughter who is single and has worked for an important company in the city for 10 years.  She says that she is a happy woman who is close to retirement age.  She enjoys her work a lot because it keeps her active and she gets to visit her friends often and make a lot of money for the family's finances.  The intensely-cold winter that the country has experienced over the last few months has affected her sales but she hopes to bounce back during the end-of-year season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":659813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

M. had thought about starting a business for a while.  When she moved to Texas from California, she discovered a niche in the shoe business and jumped on the opportunity.  Her store, Madame Shoe & Accessories, specializes in giving customers a style of merchandise that they love.  During the last year Maria and her husband, Raul, have been busy running the business and raising their 10-month-old.  \r\n\r\nMaria and Raul visited several banks to try to take out a loan without success.  The last bank they tried suggested that the couple look into ACCION Texas-Louisiana as another option.  The couple is very excited to receive a loan from ACCION. \r\n \r\nThe greatest challenge for Maria has been to get the name of the business out into the community.  When customers come in they often say \u201cI didn\u2019t know you guys were here.\u201d  The loan from ACCION is extremely important for the business because it will be used for advertising expenses.  The loan is providing the finances for newspaper ads, flyers, and other types of advertisements.  Maria and her husband hope to bring in many more customers with the boost in advertising.  Maria\u2019s advice to other entrepreneurs is to \u201ctake the time and spend the money on advertising\u201d as soon as the business opens.

For the past 16 years, this hardworking woman has had a business selling clothes in the open air (not out of a store-front). She is very satisfied with her business; she has regular income from the sales of her merchandise. She drops off the clothing orders with her customers and collects on them immediately because she does not like to work on credit since many times payments do not get made. She is accustomed to bringing a certain amount of clothing from the city, which she selects based on the weather and style. She works every day, and she says that she should look for new customers so she can have better revenues. As she is an enterprising woman, she plans to open a clothing store in the future in the local market.

Este es el segundo cr\u00e9dito que el se\u00f1or Hugo tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y su primer Credikiva el que planea invertir en la compra de camisas, pantalones, jeans, blusas, calzado y perfumes. Con la llegada del fin de a\u00f1o, los pedidos se han incrementado considerablemente, as\u00ed su volumen promedio de ventas mensuales es de $1.000.000 COP y su margen de utilidad es aproximadamente del 35%. El prestatario manifiesta que para \u00e9l es una ventaja vivir muy cerca de sus clientes porque le permite hacer una efectiva gesti\u00f3n de cobro y mantener una tasa de morosidad del 0%, asimismo, se evita gastos de transporte y tiempo por no tener que recorrer grandes distancias. El se\u00f1or Hugo planea para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o comprar varias vitrinas met\u00e1licas en las cuales pueda almacenar y exhibir toda su mercanc\u00eda, y si las cosas le salen bien, abrir un peque\u00f1o almac\u00e9n de variedades en el que adem\u00e1s de ropa, calzado y perfumes, pueda vender regalos y art\u00edculos de papeler\u00eda.","en":"Hugo Enrique A. R. lives in Barranquilla with his wife and young daughter.  He works as a security guard in a building to the north of the city, and he also sells general merchandise.  He started this business 2 years ago with a small amount of capital, and gradually his sales grew.  Most of his customers are employed as domestics, security guards and construction workers.  He provides his customers with 30 to 60 days of credit, and allows them to pay in 2 or 3 installments.  This is the second loan that Hugo has taken from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and his first loan with Kiva.  He plans to invest the money in the purchase of shirts, pants, jeans, blouses, shoes and perfume.  With the end of the year approaching, his orders have increased considerably.  His average monthly sales volume is $ 1,000,000 COP and his profit margin is approximately 35%.  Hugo states that for him it is an advantage to live very close to his customers, because it allows him to manage his collections effectively and maintain a default rate of 0 percent.  In addition, he avoids transportation expenses and saves time because he does not have to travel over long distances.  For next year, Hugo plans to buy some metal display cases where he can store and exhibit all of his merchandise, and if things go well, open a small variety store where in addition to clothing, shoes and perfume, he can sell gifts and stationery items.

Clarita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Clarita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clarita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Clarita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Clarita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the PhilippI.. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":660146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married with three children. She lives in Isfara with her family and runs her business selling blankets, kerchiefs and towels in the central market. She launched her enterprise 6 years ago. Munira has rich experience working in this business. The first time she applied to IMON International for financial assistance was 6 years ago. Ever since, her business has expanded, and she gained a reputation as an entrepreneur of integrity and great potential. \r\n\r\nMunira has consistent credit history in IMON International. We believe her positive standing and strong determination to achieve even higher goals will help her succeed and repay her loan on time. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her neat vending place has a beautiful array of inventory, customer-friendly service and exceptional prices, which has led to the preeminent success of her business. Nasiba would like to get a loan of 7500 Somoni to re-stock her inventory. She is planning on increasing her supplies of clothing to attract more potential clients to her vending place. Nasiba believes her efforts and determination, in combination with financial support, will eventually help her fully achieve her potential, leading to increased income and success.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org to seek a loan of SLL 1,400,000 for each, to enable them expand their businesses.  \r\n\r\nWith a loan of SLL 1,400,000, they will be able to add more stock to their businesses, make more sales, and create more profit. Consequently, they will be able to improve their standard of living by sending their children to school, and to feed and clothe them. \r\n\r\nFatu K. is the leader of this group.

The water is not potable.\n\nAntonio makes his home in a simple structure with his long-term partner and  4 children. He says that his most difficult challenges have been settling in a foreign city and helping his family.  He plans to continue doing business and enjoying the time he spends with his children.\n\nAntonio is excited to be taking out his third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loan and growing his business. He has had his business for 8 years, starting with a candy stand. He plans to use this loan to purchase 3 bags of rice, 2 bags of sugar, 3 big cans of oil and beans for his business. He will use the profits to paint his home and to cover some expenses with his partner for Christmas. He is dreaming of improving his business and returning to Haiti to do a good business there.\n \nThis Esperanza associate began with us because his Colmado (a small food market) needed capital to grow in products. His story is representative of his group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":660559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice, beans, oil and sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-12-10T20:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isemene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignace","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nolta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":39000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2950.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3005.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3061.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3118.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3176.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3235.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3296.31},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3357.84},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3420.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3484.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3549.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3344.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.32},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.96},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.19},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.28},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":164.15,"local_amount":5955.27,"processed_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6040.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670973,"comment":null},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":3061.25,"processed_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3105.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670974,"comment":null},{"amount":176.89,"local_amount":6417.26,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6509.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414265,"comment":null},{"amount":277.69,"local_amount":10074.36,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10219.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991145,"comment":null},{"amount":189.7,"local_amount":6881.98,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6980.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275217,"comment":null},{"amount":182.19,"local_amount":6609.88,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6704.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-14T03:15:25Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":256020,"name":"Marjorie Del Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marjorie de 33 a\u00f1os, inicio hace 10 a\u00f1os con la papeler\u00eda para poder ayudar con los gastos de su familia, vendiendo cuadernos, plumas y papeles a sus vecinos y conocidos pudo completar el dinero para ubicar su peque\u00f1a papeler\u00eda readecuo su casa y la ubico en la parte delantera de su casa. \n\nViviendo con su esposo que es artesano y sus dos hijos de 12 y 5 a\u00f1os en el suburbio de Guayaquil una zona caracterizada porque la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes son comerciantes informales ha podido incrementa su mercader\u00eda en la papeler\u00eda.

It has six female members who know each other and are neighbors.  They are:\r\n\r\n1. Araceli E. C. who will use the loan to buy skirts and blouses to stock her business\r\n\r\n2. Lul\u00fa Rodr\u00edguez Guti\u00e9rrez who is going to buy all kinds of women\u2019s cloths, pants and blouses, to stock her business\r\n\r\n3. Mitzi Yuridia B.

She\u2019s married and has three children: Lenis, 15, who is in high school, Jordy, 17, who is working, Mitzy, 18, who is in the university studying to become a P.E. Teacher.\r\n\r\nLul\u00fa\u2019s business is selling women\u2019s clothing.  She requested her loan to buy women\u2019s clothing.  She is going to buy blouses and pants and wants to use her profits to build an additional bedroom on her house because she does not have enough bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThe products she sells to her customers are ladies' pants and blouses.  She started the business four years ago.  Her mother taught her sales because her mother has always been a saleswoman.  She used to sell Fuller, Tupperware, clothes, and gift items.  Lul\u00fa would help her in the business and that\u2019s how she learned the business of sales.\r\n\r\nHer husband gave her money and she started to buy merchandise bit by bit.  Her business operates door to door in Jaloxtoc and Tlayecac.  She uses collective public transport to go sell her wares.  Her customers are young women.  The business is important and special because she makes profits and earns income to improve economically.\r\n\r\nHer favorite part of working in this business is that when she goes out to sell and is outdoors she meets many people and she feels very proud to sell her merchandise.  The challenge she faces in her business is lack of time because she doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to sell.  She can only go out to sell in the afternoons and on weekends.  Her business has a lot of competition.  There are a lot of door to door salespeople and street vendors.\r\n\r\nShe saves her profits to reinvest and to repay the loan.  She is planning to enlarge her business buying more denim pants to have merchandise available for her customers.  She is very happy with the loan she will get because she\u2019s given the opportunity to borrow money to stock her business.  Besides, as we mentioned before, she wants to make some home improvements.\r\n\r\nIn Tlayecac, April 25 is San Marcos Tlayecac Day.  Masses are celebrated, there\u2019s a fair, dancing, Brinco de Chinelos (traditional indigenous dance from the state of Morelos).  There\u2019s also a very pretty hill that seems close by.  They grow sorghum.\r\n\r\nThis business has helped her cover the children\u2019s transportation costs and to help with household expenses.  It will also help to make the home improvements; she wants to add a bedroom she needs.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to continue selling, to make the improvements she wants for her children\u2019s future, to continue working so that they can continue with their studies and this loan will help her invest in clothes.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad:  \u201cWe thank you for thinking of us and facilitating the loans to people like us who need them.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":659849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy women's pants and blouses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLAYECAC MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-08T18:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lulu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mitzi Yuridia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Lilibeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":378.56,"local_amount":4719.72,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4733.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691525,"comment":null},{"amount":412.97,"local_amount":5148.72,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5163.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430708,"comment":null},{"amount":630.58,"local_amount":7861.72,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":7884.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849983,"comment":null},{"amount":502.89,"local_amount":6269.84,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6288.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292255,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T19:23:10Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":256039,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y reside junto a su esposo y a uno de sus hijos en el sector Sialupe Humantanga,una zona rural del distrito de Lambayeque, la localidad est\u00e1 situada a m\u00e1s de media hora de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de chicha de jora (una bebida t\u00edpica del pa\u00eds que se prepara desde \u00e9pocas remotas en base a un tipo especial de harina de ma\u00edz), ella prepara esta bebida en su domicilio y la ofrece en venta en su domicilio y la reparte en algunos establecimientos de la ciudad de Lambayeque.

They chose this name because they say they are brave, that they don\u2019t fear doing new and innovative things.  The group is located in the municipality of Zit\u00e1cuaro, Michoac\u00e1n.  It has 12 members.\r\n\r\nThe group representative\u2019s name is Leticia Col\u00edn Sanabria.  She is 46 years old, married to Patricio, who is an elementary school teacher. They have four children but only one of their daughters, who\u2019s a single mother and their grandson, Santiago, 4, who Leticia has cared for since birth because her daughter was still in school and is now working as an Accountant, lives with them.\r\n\r\nLeti is asking for her loan to invest in her fine jewelry (gold) business.  She stocks up in the city of Morole\u00f3n, Guanajuato, because she gets good prices there because she\u2019s been a customer there for 12 years.  She is then able to raise prices just a little and not be forced to sell her jewelry for prices that are too expensive.  She comments that she is really putting in much effort into her work because she wants her son, who is studying Law, to finish his career and be able to buy him the textbooks he requires.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals for right now is to acquire customers and sell to people who won\u2019t fall back on their payments, above all to people who have stable employment.  One of her dreams is to rent a locale that she can set up shop in because it\u2019s quite dangerous to be carrying fine jewelry in the street. Another one of her dreams is to be able to repair her house because in the rainy season there are leaks.\r\n\r\nElvia B. L\u00f3pez is also part of the \u201cLAS AUDACES\u201d group.  She is 43 years old and finished 8th graD..  She comments that she was unable to finish her education because her parents didn\u2019t have enough money to continue paying her school costs.  Elvia is married to Lemuel who sells animals like sheep and cows.  They have 6 children but only one of them, named Ricardo who works with his father and helps sell the animals, lives with them.\r\n\r\nShe sells catalogue beauty products like creams, cosmetics, etc.  She also sells women\u2019s lingerie by catalogue.  She has been in this business for about 6 years.  She decided to go into it to help her husband meet their children\u2019s expenses because there was a time when they were all in school and they had to pay tuition and rent in other cities where they were studying.  Elvia is asking for her loan to invest in lingerie and cosmetics to have stock on hand and not have to place orders because this is time consuming.\r\n\r\nThe other 10 members are: Ma. Guadalupe Jim\u00e9nez Rojas, Irma M. Andr\u00e9s, Ma. Maribel V\u00e1zquez Araujo, Yolanda M. Vilchis, Avelina L. Morales, Amalia D. L. C.

The group's members decided to give it this name because the group was founded in the Spring and it was extremely hot at the time.  The Primavera Extreme group is located in Pachuca Hidalgo in Mexico.  It has 9 members.\r\n\r\nMrs Karina M. is the group's president.  She is 31 years old and studied up to the third year of high school.  She sells shoes and bedspreads.  She is a single mother and has 2 children: a 10 year-old girl and a 12 year-old boy.  She started this business because her job as a cleaner didn't pay enough so she decided to look for more income.  She is requesting this loan to invest in her business selling shoes and bedspreads since she needs more investment in these months since it is a good season for sales of her products.  She says that the support she gets from her loans is very important for her and her family since she reinvests her money and can thereby support her children in their studies and get them ahead in life which is very important for her.  In the photo Mrs Angelica R. A. is missing because she had a school meeting to

Mar\u00eda Elizabeth lives with her common-law husband Se\u00f1or Juan Diego L\u00f3pez Guzm\u00e1n and their 3 children, Juan Daniel, 17, Eduardo, 13 and the youngest, Francisco Javier, 10.  She takes care of the household and also sells tamales, sandwiches and other things.  She has been doing this for five years and says that it is going well since it supports her family.  This business was started by her brothers who live outside the city.  They encouraged her to do the same in the city and this is how she started.   With the loan she plans to purchase more ingredients so that she can work three times a week and bring in more income for her household, save some money and make her payments to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad on time.  She dreams of buying some land to leave to her children for the future.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Antonia invited her to join their communal bank and now she is able to take out a loan to support her business.  The group is called \"The Two Olive Trees\"  because they are the symbols of the Biblical figures Moses and Elias.   The members of the group are as follows: Antonia Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez, who will use the loan to buy cocoa and utensils; Mar\u00eda Elizabeth Gonz\u00e1lez Ju\u00e1rez who will buy ingredients to make tamales and sandwiches; and Edali M. V\u00e1zquez who will use the loan to buy corn on the cob to cook and sell.
