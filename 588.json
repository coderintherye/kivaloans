As the owner of \u201cTexas Overhead Doors,\u201d Jamie works in the residential and commercial sectors of the construction industry.  A few examples of his work include building custom gates, mounting garage doors, installing fire alarms, and removing sections of wall for new doors.  He especially enjoys doing custom work that requires him to think creatively, and he has developed the reputation of being the person to call for complicated jobs.  For example, there is a large garage door installation company who contacts him for jobs they deem to be too involved to be worth their time.  As Jamie puts it, \u201cI get a lot of weird jobs.\u201d  \r\n\r\nJamie was referred to ACCION Texas-Louisiana by his local bank.  With this loan, Jamie bought a scissor lift that helps him install large doors used for commercial buildings.  This scissor lift expands Jamie\u2019s business capabilities because its height allows him to install taller doors than he previously could.  The scissor lift Jamie bought is in good condition, and he estimates that it will last him at least ten years.\r\n\r\nThough Jamie usually works alone, he hires sub-contractors to help him with his larger commissions.  Down the road, Jamie wants his business to begin specializing in door maintenance.  Companies would have him inspect and maintain their doors to prevent them from breaking and becoming a bigger problem later.  This line of work would be advantageous to his business because it is less labor-intensive than what he does now, while still maintaining a high profit margin.  Jamie has five children, his youngest being 17-year-old twins.

Since he was a young boy his parents taught him how to work the land. With time he became a farmer and during the years he managed to save enough to purchase his own parcel of land, 18 hectares in area. He currently cultivates cocoa and bananas. He has 20 years' experience in agriculture and he knows the arduous work that is involved in the land. When the harvest season arrives he hires farmhands to help him carry his harvest to the location where it will be sold. He is very committed to his work and thanks to his daily efforts he enjoys the quality of his plants and the sales earn him a good income. During the winter he must ensure that the insect plagues do not harm his plantations. This is his 12th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). He know that if he pays it on time he will be able to access a loan in the future and he will not carry any difficulties to his communal bank. The loan that he requests will be used to purchase cocoa plants that will be grafted to obtain a greater yield.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":760436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cocoa plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-29T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2049.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385300,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-30T18:02:48Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":294583,"name":"Porfirio Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Porfirio est\u00e1 muy feliz, pues con su credikiva aument\u00f3 la fabricaci\u00f3n de salchipapas y hamburguesas se ha entusiasmado y como necesita un fondo de efectivo para comprar materias primas e insumos para responder oportunamente, est\u00e1 recurriendo a su segundo financiamiento mediante la l\u00ednea credikiva. \nPorfirio F. envia el siguiente mensaje a sus fondeadores de Kiva : \"Muchas gracias por el apoyo financiero\" esto es porque ha logrado aumentar su capital de trabajo, su liquidez sus ventas y sus utilidades y  debido a esto y con la ayuda de sus familiares, reuni\u00f3 dinero y compr\u00f3 una vivienda para el y su familia.\nSi usted quiere conocer la historia de Porfirio, ingrese al siguiente enlace:\nhttp:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/230318","en":"Porfirio is very happy because with his Kiva loan he was able to increase production of salchipapas (a traditional fast food consisting of sausages and french fries) and hamburgers.

His plants benefit from being cared for in a technical manner. He received training from the Agricultural Engineers periodically.

En tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los peones. Sabe muy bien que el dinero que obtiene es por producir buena calidad de frutos. Sus productos de cacao y caf\u00e9 los comercializa  en la ciudad de San Francisco y Quimbiri, lugares donde mejores precios le ofrecen por la venta de estos productos. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos, ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos. Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es trasladar sus productos desde la chacra hasta los secaderos que est\u00e1n ubicados a 1 horas de caminata. M\u00e1s adelante desea sembrar m\u00e1s plantas de cacao.

He lives with 23 year old Gladis, and they have three children.  They live together in their own house in the Villa Quintiarina community.  Juan is a farmer.  His parents taught him this occupation when he was a very young boy.  He has been working his own land for ten years.  He makes use of technology to grow cacao and coffee.\r\n\r\nHe has help from field workers during harvest time.  He well knows that the money he gets is for producing a good quality of crops.  He sells his cacao and coffee products in the cities of San Francisco and Quimbiri.  Those are the places where he can get better prices selling these products.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes best about his work is harvesting the fruits.  He feels that the months of hard work compensate him with the quality of his fruits.  He considers the most difficult part to be transporting the products from the farm to the dryers, located two hours away on foot.  Later he would like to plant more cacao.\r\n\r\nThis is his 12th loan with MFP.  This support will really help him in the progress of his work.  He is prepared to make his payments on time.  He likes working as a team because it is happy to belong to his communal bank.  The requested loan is to buy wood and corrugated roofing material because he plans to repair his house with rudimentary material.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":760531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy wood and corrugated roofing material ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-29T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1554.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385305,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-01T19:59:15Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":294624,"name":"Silvia Filomena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Silvia de profesi\u00f3n estilista con varios a\u00f1os de experiencia, pues logro poner su propio negocio un sal\u00f3n de belleza, donde d\u00eda a d\u00eda da su servicio, para lograr ganar y cubrir sus gastos.\nA si como la mejora a su vivienda, que gracias  a los pr\u00e9stamos que Afodenic est\u00e1 dando ha mejorado la infraestructura, con el cr\u00e9dito anterior era para cambiar el techo pero debido a que no ajusto con el presupuesto, desvi\u00f3 el cr\u00e9dito y hizo el ba\u00f1o con azulejos a si como la compra del inodoro.

She has been selling traditional aprons (called delantales) for 10 years and would like the opportunity to weave a higher quality apron for her clients. When she was 22 years old, Juana started putting together aprons for her personal use and has since developed her business selling her creations to her customers.  \r\n\r\nJuana is 32 years old, single, and has one daughter. In the future, she would like to sell a wider variety of high quality aprons in a big store.\r\n\r\nThe other two members of the Tzanjuyup Group are involved in animal raising and clothing sales.

She learned to sew from her uncle, and perfected her techniques through training at SENA.  She strengthened her business through loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, from which she has received 2 loans.  With this loan from Kiva she will buy handicrafts and supplies for her sewing workshop.  This is a safe investment because she works based on orders from her customers, particularly in the seasons when there is the most tourism in her area.  Mary Luz tells us that the loans have increased her working capital and her profits, which has allowed her to improve her home and buy household goods needed by her family.  Her dream is to keep increasing her profits through disciplined work, so that she can make improvements to her home until it is absolutely beautiful.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":507.03,"image":{"id":760548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

She raises pigs, sheep and ducks and sells them to merchants who visit the area.  She learned her trade from her parents and knows her job very well.  There is a lot of competition in the business but also a lot of demand in the market.  She also earns an income giving private lessos to grade school children.  She wants to buy sheep to raise and also renovate the location, inside her home, where she gives classes.  Therefore she decided to request a loan in the amount of 1,500 PEN through Edpyme Alternativa."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":760526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sheep to raise and to renovate the location where she gives private classes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mochum\u00ed - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-05-02T06:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ida Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":103.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":105.43},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":113.26},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":123.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":126.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":130.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":135.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":138.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":144.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":147.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.53},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.48},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.61},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":76.61,"local_amount":208.93,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":216.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211211022,"comment":null},{"amount":41.53,"local_amount":113.26,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":117.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489272,"comment":null},{"amount":85.09,"local_amount":232.08,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":240.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182184,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":249.99,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":259.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583717,"comment":null},{"amount":47.78,"local_amount":130.32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":135.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244541946,"comment":null},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":135.29,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":140.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752546,"comment":null},{"amount":50.69,"local_amount":138.25,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":143.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257394598,"comment":null},{"amount":107.02,"local_amount":291.88,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":302.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290093,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-02T08:26:03Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:11:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":294666,"name":"Kumarhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kumarhan B. is 52 years old and lives with her three children in Bayan-Ulgii province, Mongolia.

K. is 36 years old, married, and has three children, two of whom attend school. They live in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, in a small house in the outer ger (Mongolian tent) district of the city.  When Mungunnavch first began her jewelry business with her husband in 2000, her husband worked as a jeweler at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia and Mungunnavch used to find customers. In 2005 they started running a jewelry retail stall at Narantuul. At the beginning stages of their jewelry retail stall, they had 3,000,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT) in working capital. As a result of their hard work, today they have 8,000,000 MNT in working capital and Mungunnavch sells gold rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets to their customers.

is a 51-year-old married man, living in Tyre with his wife and five kids. He sells fire extinguishers, security alarms and  safes. He is a hard worker. It's been only six years since he started this business, and now he's well experienced in this domain.

is a married woman with three children, all of whom are adults.

During the rainy season, it becomes difficult to operate.  Hence few customers come to her food stall. She dreams of opening a hotel in the future.

M. is a single lady who has 2 children, ages 5 and 10 years old, whom she hopes to give a good education to the university level. Irene makes food, mainly plain beans and githeri (a mixture of cooked maize and beans) by the roadside. She sells to passersby and repeat buyers in a residential area in Mombasa. Mombasa is in the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, especially the Indian Ocean white beaches. \r\n\r\nIrene has been doing this business for the last 3 years now. She says that her business is profitable, but the major challenge she has is lack of a premises where she could run and grow her food business.

He owns an electronic sales shop and also does computer repairs in Kakamega town. Kakamega is a rich agricultural area found in the western region of Kenya. The area is known for large-scale production of sugarcane and thus commonly referred to as the \"sugar belt region\". \n\nHe says that this business is profitable, but the major challenge he has is financial constraints. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well.

Safina is a sturdy, candid and enterprising woman who, friends say, has a streak of hard work in whatever she does. That virtue has been of paramount importance in her 11 years of experience in the teaching profession. Safina, who is happily married with 2 kids, derives her livelihood from teaching at schools in and around Mabada in the Mpigi district of Central Uganda. The commitment she has shown in practicing what she was taught at a training institution is exemplary, notwithstanding the low remuneration that teachers all over Uganda are faced with. \r\n\r\nWhat has been of much help to Safina is the fact that she also does some farming as a side business. At present, she says she wants to invest more in her farming business as she reckons she will be able to earn from it if she improves her gardens with high grade manure. From her teaching job, she earns 270,000 shillings per month. Safina says with proceeds from the requested loan she is going to purchase high grade manure to improve the fertility of her gardens for farming."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":760911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

She moved to Barranquilla 32 years ago after leaving Armero, a city that was wiped out by a mudslide, a type of natural distaster that occurs in Colombia.  Once she got set up in Barranquilla, she formed a family and now has two children, ages 12 and 14.  She dreams about them being successful professionals in whatever career they choose for themselves.\r\n\r\nLuz Mary, being the enterprising woman that she it, looked for ways to earn money to help her husband, who is a taxi driver, cover the household expenses.  With the support of her neighbors, she established a grocery store where she sells canned goods, groceries, liqueurs, chicken, meat and general daily use products.  She sells on a cash basis and has the ideal infrastructure for this type of business: shelves, refrigeration and a well-organized array of products that keep her customers loyal.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to continue working harder and also attend to her family and work responsibilities.  The CrediKiva loan is her first one through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She will use it to buy groceries, canned goods, softdrinks, etc. in larger quantities so she can obtain good volume discounts.  She also wants to keep her range of products varied to appeal to her customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":435.17,"image":{"id":759527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She manages to generate enough income to provide for her two children, with whom she lives in the neighborhood \"La ciudadela 20 de Julio\". This neighborhood is characterized by a developed and profitable commercial sector with formal and informal employment possibilities, interwoven with sports facilities and residential areas. This community is constantly busy and often crowded, because it is located next to the Metropolitan Stadium, where professional teams from all over Colombia compete. In addition, it is the home of Junior de Barranquilla, a professional soccer team cherished by the residents of the entire coastal region of Colombia.\r\n\r\nVilma started her business in 1999 with local customers. At first she sold to friends and relatives, before gradually expanding her clientele. She began with a few products and later expanded her inventory, when she joined other companies which promote their products through catalogs. Competition is high, and Vilma carefully selects her customers and offers them convenient payment schedules. She offers preferred service and good sales opportunities to profitable clients in order to create customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, a microfinance institution to which she has been connected for ten years through its financial and non-financial services. As a result, she has increased her liquidity and improved her administrative skills. Her new loan is her first loan in FMSD's Kiva program (\"credikiva\"). She will use it to buy products for women, such as footwear, clothes and cosmetics. She wants to be ready to meet the demand from her customers for Mother's Day, so that this investment will be successful.\r\n\r\nHer goal and big challenge is to become a homeowner, and in spite of her insufficient working capital she puts every effort into her activity to fulfill her dream.

With this loan from Kiva she plans to increase her working capital and purchase the merchandise that her customers have ordered, such as women's clothing, underwear, shoes, drinks and liquor, since Mother's Day is coming up and every family wants to come together and spoil the women in their lives, be they mothers, wives, daughters or friends."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":398.05,"image":{"id":761109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase the merchandise that her customers have ordered, such as women's clothing, underwear, shoes, drinks and liquor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-04-30T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":68740},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74657},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76088},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":77546},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":79033},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80548},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":82091},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83665},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":85268},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":92364}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.8},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.67,"local_amount":68740,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":69173.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509460,"comment":null},{"amount":41.99,"local_amount":74657,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":75128.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673682,"comment":null},{"amount":42.8,"local_amount":76088,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":76568.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320243,"comment":null},{"amount":43.62,"local_amount":77546,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":78035.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803376,"comment":null},{"amount":44.46,"local_amount":79033,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":79531.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614455,"comment":null},{"amount":45.3,"local_amount":80548,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":81056.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568421,"comment":null},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":82091,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":82609.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779762,"comment":null},{"amount":95.03,"local_amount":168933,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":169999.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-16T22:52:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":294883,"name":"Nestor Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"N\u00e9stor Alberto tiene 27 a\u00f1os, su actividad es brindar el servicio de taller de soldadura y pintura.

V. is 41 years old and lives in the Municipality of San Jacinto.  It is a place characterized for making hammocks, bags, hats and accessories with vertical stitching and also for the fact that many women work in making them.  In this context, Mar\u00eda lives up to the tradition and started her business making handicrafts and all types of clothing.  She learned from family tradition, perfecting her skills at Sena (a technical state company) and strengthening them with the loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She has three children who are 10, 5, and 3 and are all in school, as Mar\u00eda and her husband\u2019s efforts are focused on raising them to be successful and well-educated people.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda\u2019s second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She invested her previous loan in handicrafts, clothing and poultry meat because she looks to earn income in different areas required by her customers.  With her loan from Kiva, she will buy yarn for weaving hammocks, backpacks and to make a few bedspreads that have been requested.  She will also invest in the purchase of materials for her workshop.  She believes her investment will be successful because has orders for hand-embroidered bedspreads, hammocks and bags in the cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena, where she has her biggest market.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda Esperanza is very enthusiastic about her business because it has allowed her to gradually build her own house, located near where her family currently lives.  Her goal is to expand her business and set up a locale to exhibit her products, as well as to save for her children\u2019s education.  Meanwhile, Mar\u00eda continues to have an 18% profit margin and is working hard to increase it.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":541.17,"image":{"id":761185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy materials for her workshop, as well as yarn for weaving hammocks, backpacks and to make a few bedspreads that have been requested.

She has four children ranging from 19 to 41 years old.  She is a widow, and she lives in the city of Cartagena D. Indias.  This city is on the northern coast of Colombia, and that is where she has her business, \u201cArtesan\u00edas Gladis\u201d (Gladis\u2019 Handicrafts).\r\n\r\nWhen she came to Cartagena in 1981 she started making handicrafts in her own home.  She sold them to people nearby.  She had a business site in the center of the city, but the owners sold the place.  She had to close her business.\r\n\r\nAs Gladys is persistent, she devoted herself to teaching her art.  Later she organized handicraft fairs.  She established her business again and got customers.  Her goal is to get more publicity for her business so that she is able to promote it again.  That way she will achieve important growth that will generate greater income.\r\n\r\nGladys lives in a traditional tourist neighborhood with immense colonial houses.  It borders upon the Cartagena Bay and a growing commercial sector, which is very close to the city harbor.  Her main customers are located in the Manga, Pie D. la Popa, and the BocagranD. neighborhoods.  \r\n\r\nHer liabilities are the accounts to be paid to her providers.  Her business is always well stocked.  She is now applying for her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Over time, he would like to buy new land so that he can increase his production.\r\n\r\nThis is Juan's third loan from MFP.  He was very punctual in repaying his first loan and he hopes to be punctual in repaying this loan too.

province) where he lives now. Dayirbek is 49 years old. He was born and grew up in a big middle class family with eleven children, but after graduating from high school he could not continue his education in the university due to a difficult financial situation. Dayirbek has enrolled in a technical school with a major in veterinary and at the same time was helping his parents in business. In 1982-1985 he served in the army which helped strengthen his character. After returning from the army Dayirbek began to work in his home village as a veterinarian and to this day the village residents come to him for help. In 1996 in search of an additional source of income for his family he decided to start a business in farming which gave big profits as at that time Dayirbek got married and his daughter was born. Dayirbek started his business with 20,000 KGS and bought just one cow and one calf for feeding, and at this time he has one milk cow, one horse and ten sheep.\r\n\r\nRight now Dayirbek needs financial help in the amount of 60,000 KGS to increase the head count of cattle and expansion of business because education expenses are growing. He has to start saving money now for his children's education in a good university so they can get a decent education. But Dayirbek does not want to stop there and his other plans for the future include purchase of a fold with plot of land and increase of cattle head count.\r\n\r\nHe is hard working and single-minded, responsible and punctual person with an optimistic outlook on life and dreams for creating conditions for a happy life for his children and give them confidence in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nZAO MFK Bai Tushum & Partners provides loans through Kiva for socially vulnerable population regions.
