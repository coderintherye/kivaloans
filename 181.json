The most tedious part of his job is having to clear his land and take care of his crops day after day.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help poor and low income clients develop viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kabul is a hardworking father with the responsibility of taking care of his wife and two children, the driving force for his work. Early every morning, David leaves to take care of his farmland, irrigating and fertilizing in order to produce quality crops that will earn a good income. His wife and children also help him with his business. \r\n\r\nOne of this couple\u2019s dreams is to enable both of their children to achieve higher educations so that one day they\u2019ll become great persons. To that end, they are requesting the current loan to increase their crop production by buying seed, fertilizer and other supplies needed for productive farming of their land.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing  hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married and the father of two children. He has a large and friendly family including: his wife, children, mother and brother. For 5 years, he has been engaged in a farming business. The love for his children is the motivator that keeps him working hard for their future. He works fast together with the help of his brother to achieve quality produce. <P>\r\n\r\nThe high price of fertilizer has caused his production to slow down; he wishes to do better, have more production and increase the number of hectares with crops. To do that, Obloior needs capital, which he is requesting through a loan and hopes that you can help him. This way he can look forward to a profitable production to increase his income and pay for his children\u2019s education.\r\n <P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Berdi J. is 58 years old and a resident of Aktepa province in Sugd region where he has owned a plot of land since 1984. He grows rice, which he plants twice a year. He is married and a good father of three children. His wife is a teacher in the local school. <P>\r\n\r\nTo help meet the hard physical labor of his farming work, two of his older children are working with him. Rice growing is the main source of income to sustain this family. Berdi is applying for a 700 USD loans to buy seeds and fertilizer. This loan will ensure the economic prosperity of this friendly family.<P>\r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Looking to increase his income, George wanted to start a small business that would be easy to maintain while he continued his boda-boda work. He decided on a poultry business, since after feeding and giving water to the chickens he would be free to work during the day. <P>\r\n\r\nA new member to the K-MET network, George was interested in becoming one of K-MET\u2019s Community Health Workers so that he could \u201chelp the people near him who need assistance.\u201d He also found out about K-MET\u2019s micro-finance program and is now applying for a loan of approximately 150 USD in order to expand his poultry business.<P>\r\n\r\nGeorge has 15 chickens at present and sells the eggs to his neighbors. He would like to use the loan money to purchase about 150 chickens. After expanding the number of poultry, he will be able to expand his sales, perhaps getting a stall in the local market.

Zubaida baji wants a loan to buy a buffalo for her milk-selling business. Naziran baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. Shamim Akhtar baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). <P>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":274842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

The goods are sold in cash at the marketplaces of Dallen, Nimbougou, and Loulouni, to customers composed generally of men. \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing an average monthly profit of 12,500 francs CFA that will be used for the most part to augment her working capital. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":274845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy grain (corn and sorghum) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":90217,"name":"Rajabbi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\n \u042e\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0431\u0431\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d-\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 53 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0420\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439. \u041f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442. \u0414\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0435 10 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f , \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443  \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442.\u041f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 12 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432.","en":"Rajabbi U. lives in the city of Tursun-zoda.

She lives in the Nyalenda area of Kisumu, Kenya. In 2008 she started a vegetable stall in her neighborhood, after switching from a tailoring business she had started in 2005. The tailoring business was not doing well, so she decided to start selling vegetables, which has since proved to be profitable. She sells kale, cabbage, tomatoes, as well as fruit, chips (French fries), and kerosene.  <P>\r\n\r\nEunice has applied for a loan of approximately 150 USD; she will use this money to boost her

He delivers the items on his donkey cart. He has been doing this work for the past 10 years. <P>\r\n\r\nSamaat baji is a very hard-working lady. She has a buffalo at her house. She gets up early and gets milk from her buffalo and sells it in different milk shops and earns income. She successfully repaid two loans from Asasah (a micro-finance institute in Pakistan). Now she is applying again for a loan to buy a new donkey cart because the old cart has become worn out. <P>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader for some more women from her locality. Parveen baji wants a loan to buy fruit for her fruit-selling business. Anwar baji and Majida baji each want a loan to buy livestock (goats) to sell. Nusrat baji wants a loan to buy utensils to sell. \r\n<P>\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business.

Everlyne mainly sells girls' dresses, though she would like to expand into selling bags, both school bags and ladies' bags. In order to do this, Everlyne has applied for a loan of approximately 200 USD from K-MET, which she will use to purchase bags. <P>\r\n\r\nEverlyne is 28 years old, married, and the mother of two

She lives in the Nyalenda area of Kisumu. Emily works in food sales, owning a small shop that sells foodstuffs. She began this business because it is fast moving and she makes quick sales. Educated at a college level (Science Lab and Technology), Emily used to work at a salon. She decided this year to open her own business. <p>\r\n\r\nEmily has applied for her first loan from K-MET, for approximately $150 USD. She will use this money to enlarge her business by purchasing new inventory and expanding her range of foodstuffs.

This area is located on the northern outskirts of Santo Domingo.  Jeimy\u00b4s group is on their third loan cycle and Yasmel\u00b4s group is on its first. <p>\r\n\r\nJeimy has 3 children, ages 11, 9 and 2. She sells shoes from a catalog. She sells from her own home and also visits her clients to show them the catalog so they can place their orders. The shoes she sells the most are women\u00b4s. She will use this loan to purchase the shoes her clients have ordered from her. She says her biggest challenge is to get her customers to pay her on time. She dreams of one day renting a space where she can have her own store and sell not only shoes, but also clothes and accessories. <p>\r\n\r\nYasmel has a one-year-old daughter. She sells clothes for all ages. The highest demand she gets is for women\u00b4s clothing. She buys her merchandise by bundles in order to buy a larger amount at a much smaller price. She sells from home, where her customers visit her. Her dream is to one day have her own store in Avenida Duarte in Santo Domingo (the largest commercial strip in the city). <p>\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Esperanza International, thank you for supporting these entrepreneurs! \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":274876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

She began her business in 2008 and gets her stock of shoes from Busia, Kenya (on the border of Uganda) and from Uganda.  For two years prior, she used to sell second-hand clothes, but changed her business due to the high level of competition and lack of market for the products. \r\n\r\nRoseline has applied for a loan of approximately $275 USD.

Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care. \r\n\r\nPamela is 20 years old, unmarried, and has no children. She lives in the Nyalenda district of Kisumu. \r\n\r\nPamela started a tailoring business in the Nyalenda district in 2007. Prior to that, she attended dressmaking training school from 2004 to 2006. She chose to start this business to enable herself to be independent and to earn an income. Pamela makes African attire and local church attire. She gets her materials from Busia, a town on the border of Uganda (about a 5 hour bus ride from Kisumu). \r\n\r\nPamela has applied for her first loan of $275 USD from K-MET.  She will use the loan money to purchase tailoring materials in bulk from Busia. By buying in bulk instead of small amounts, this will reduce her travel time and save her

Four of her children are currently attending school. Her family lives in the Nyalenda district of Kisumu.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Jane started a business selling mandazi (similar to doughnuts), chapatti (a soft flat bread), and vegetables. The business is located in Nyalenda. Initially, the business did not require a large amount of capital and the products sold quickly. Jane has applied for a loan of $150 USD in order to buy products to make mandazi and chapatti in bulk.

All the members live in Villa Mella, on the northern outskirts of Santo Domingo. The group coordinators are Carmen M., Justa H., and Rosa S.. \r\n\r\nJusta has four children; ages 26, 23, 19 and 17. Her children do not live with her anymore, but three of her grand-children do.  She sells personal care products and also runs a fried food stand. She says her peak business days are weekends. She has a volunteer helper on some mornings when she is not at the house. Justa is seeking a loan to make repairs on her business and buy new merchandise.  \r\n\r\nJusta\u00b4s favorite activity is cooking and she says people really like her food. One day, she dreams of having her own restaurant where she can serve her clients with all kinds of food, including her favorites desserts. \r\n\r\nCarmen has a two year old daughter. Four months ago, Carmen opened a colmado which is a small grocery store.   She recognizes her job is very demanding job because she is required to be at the store all the time. However, she also thinks this brings her great satisfaction. \u201cIt means I\u00b4m always there for my customers, so I\u00b4m satisfied by serving them\u201d she says.  She dreams of one day having a large grocery store where her customers can find anything they might need. She will use the full amount of her loan to purchase merchandise to restock her business.\r\n\r\nRosa has four children who are all grown up. She runs a business managing rental houses. She will use her loan to make repairs on the houses she shows for rent. She hopes one day to be a formal real estate agent and to be able to offer her customers houses for rent in excellent conditions. \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting these entrepreneurs!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":274901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

G., is a farmer by profession. Meena baji is the mother of four children: two sons and two daughters. Her elder son is a driver and drives a tractor in the fields. The next oldest son is involved in a milk selling business. Her daughters are single and do household work and taking care of the family. Meena baji belongs to a family of farmers, so she spends most of her time in the fields growing several types of crops. She successfully repaid her first two loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to buy another buffalo for her second son so that he will be able to earn good income from his milk selling business. \r\n\r\nShe is a loan group leader of some of the women in her locality. Razia baji wants a loan to buy chickens to sell. Manzooran baji wants a loan to buy electric supplies (electric wires, neon lights and switches) for her electric shop. Sugran baji wants a loan to buy seasonal fruits for her fruit selling business. Shahnaz baji wants a loan to buy vegetables for her vegetable selling business. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":274920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Nora sells meals for a living.  Her stand is located near a commuter stop and a busy roadway, which guarantees her a secure income.  Every day she makes the effort to get up very early in the morning to prepare food since she sells breakfasts and lunches to very discerning customers, usually drivers who work for the nearby transportation companies.  The meals that Nora makes are delicious and of high quality.  After 20 years of supporting herself with this business, she would like to improve upon it and widen the selection of meals and beverages for her customers.

Y. is a small entrepreneur from Vinogradovo. She is in the business of selling synthetic leather jackets and children\u2019s clothing in a trading complex called \u201cVeronika\u201d. Irina has no competitors in this sphere of business. Moreover, financial assistance from Nadiya Ukraine added much to the success of Irina\u2019s venture. Irina has been in this trade for 4 years. Currently, she has about 70,000 Grivnas in inventory. \r\n\r\nIrina\u2019s business is characterized by stability and consistent growth. She has proven to be a reliable client as she has had a good credit history with Nadiya Ukraine ever since she got her first loan. One of the attractions of her business is Irina\u2019s natural thoughtfulness and friendliness as she serves her customers. This makes buying from her a pleasant experience. Today she is requesting an 8,000 Grivna loan to re-stock her merchandise and purchase additional items for retail sale.

A. O. recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya.<p>\r\n\r\nAs a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illnesses. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care. <p>\r\n\r\nCaroline is 31 years old, married, and has 4 children; 3 are in school, and the fourth is still too young to attend. She lives with her family in the small village of Dunga on the outskirts of Kisumu.<p>\r\n\r\nCaroline used to manage a children\u2019s orphanage in Kisumu and was offered a post to manage another orphanage in Nairobi; however, when they discovered she was pregnant she was dismissed. She now has a shop in Dunga, where she sells foodstuffs and small household goods. <p>\r\n\r\nCaroline\u2019s husband used to have a small business selling secondhand shoes at the bus station in Kisumu, but during the post-election violence his business was destroyed. Caroline now provides the family\u2019s income while her husband continues to look for more permanent work beyond the small jobs he does currently. <p>\r\n\r\nAlong with running a shop, Caroline teaches reading and writing to adults. She has been teaching for 3 years. There are 50 adults enrolled in her class, but daily attendance varies between 5 to 10 people, as schedules do not allow students to attend daily. <p>\r\n\r\nCaroline was interested in joining K-MET in order to learn about health education that she may pass on to her adult students. She would like to be able to teach them about family planning and nutrition, as well as the reading and writing.<p>\r\n\r\nCaroline has applied for her first loan from K-MET, in the amount of approximately $275. She will use the loan to purchase more stock for her shop: foodstuffs and household goods like bleach.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":274978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

He has 5 children, 4 of whom attend a school sponsored jointly by the church and the government, and his wife sometimes sells snacks at the children\u2019s school.  Jose has 10 years of experience in his line of work so he is very familiar with his field.  Even though he did not complete higher education, he is very experienced in reading construction plans.  In our area there are many people who work in this field, but Jose has many business contacts who always hire him for different construction jobs.  The cost of building a house differs based on the size and whether detailed finishing is included in the job.  Right now Jose is working in the countryside building a barbeque restaurant in the province of San Javier.  He has good credit history since he only works with the Agrocapital organization.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva

Maria has her own business preparing and selling food, lunches, and extra dishes.  She has an advantage in her business because in front of her house is the final stop of a bus line. She also runs a small neighborhood store from her house.  Her competition is quite low because there are no other stalls selling food to the bus drivers, and her store has a wide variety of goods and a stable client base. With this loan Maria plans to increase the working capital for her food stall as well as for her corner store. This is Maria\u2019s third loan cycle.  She is a very responsible person who has repaid the previous loans without problems.  She had a few late repayments but the delays were not significant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva

She had no way to provide for herself and for her mother, who is dependent on her. At first, she ran a stationer's out of her house, taking advantage of the fact that her street is a very busy one; then she expanded the range of items she sold to include household products and cosmetics. After a while, an aunt of hers convinced her to start selling gold jewelery in the run up to Valentine's day. Lourdes took her advice and her jewelery business took off. Necklaces and bracelets came into fashion, and she sold many kinds. She also began to read up on how to make jewelery, and really enjoys the process. Now she makes many pieces herself.  Since her jewelery business has grown, she has also added other products to her stock. Now, to complement the jewelery, she offers other kinds of gifts and novelty items. In this way, she can have various streams of income and won't be completely dependent on jewelery sales. Lourdes needs a loan of $10,000 pesos, which she will repay in 12 installments, so that she can buy supplies she needs to make bags, bracelets, necklaces, rings, etc. She wants to have lots to offer this Valentine's day and she wants to be able to help people give their friends gifts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

Although she ran the store off and on for a while, it has been her only business since February 2002. Since then, she has dedicated herself full time to the store and to her parents. In fact, not only has Lourdes opened a second store in another neighbourhood, with her sister and neighbour helping her run it, she has also bought a photocopier and three computers to help turn the first store into a cyber cafe as well as a stationer's. Little by little, her business is growing. \r\nLourdes needs a loan of $12,000 pesos, which she will pay back in 10 installments, so that she can buy stationary to sell. She is short on capital at the moment. Because of the money she spent on the computers, she does not have enough left over for merchandise. \r\n. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

Rosemary thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":275100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more shirts; hand bags and pouches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130799,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027588,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613589,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010668,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232954,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-01T14:11:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":90342,"name":"Irina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irina sells bed sheets, towels, and blankets at the central market.

It is important to point out that each sister works independently and has her own income.  The members of the group have their own business that specialize in such things as the sale of foods, cosmetics and fruit, in the repair of computers, and in the preparation of snack foods and meals.  The members are aware that their businesses face competition but they also know how to work hard and get ahead, thanks to their experience and their good character.   This loan will be used to buy diverse types of products, to expand their businesses selling food and also to buy materials and ingredients.  The members will then be able to increase their income and provide their families with a better quality of life.

They all want to use the loans to improve their businesses and the quality of their products.  The loan that they are asking for will be used to purchase merchandise, buy materials and tools so that they can increase their income.  In terms of the experience of all of the group members, it can be said that the majority of the members have worked with the \"agrocapital\" foundation and they know about the responsibility that they have to meet the obligations they have by being a member of that institution.\r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Mariela of San Roque High School)\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kendra

Her husband has passed, and she is currently living with a nephew or niece in the town of Dai Bi, Uy No, Dong Anh, Ha Noi.  She runs a stand selling beverages, breakfast foods (beef noodle, vermicelli rice bowls, etc.)  Her family's average income is 200,000 VND per week.  This is her first time participating in the Fund so she is borrowing 1,972,000 VND to invest in her food stand.  She will work very hard to repay the loan in full in order to be able to borrow larger amounts to improve her family's quality of life.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen,

Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care. <p>\r\n\r\nGrace is 34 years old and a widow. She has 2 children, a girl and a boy, who are both in school. She heard about K-MET from friends and decided that she wanted to join and be trained to work in the community. <p>\r\n\r\nGrace has worked in salons for 9 years. She was interested and the practice was easy for her, so in 2002 she took a stylist course in Kisumu in order to get more qualifications. In 2006 Grace started her own salon in the Nyalenda area of Kisumu. She employs one other woman to work in the salon. <p>\r\n\r\nThis will be Grace\u2019s first loan from K-MET. She has applied for approximately $200 and will use the loan to buy chemicals, hair pieces, weaves, shampoo, and conditioner.

A. recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya.<p>\r\n\r\nAs a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illnesses. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care. <p>\r\n\r\nMerit was diagnosed with HIV several years ago. For a time she was sick at home, but when she began to feel better she talked with her friends about how to live with HIV. Her friends recommended that she start a business so that she could keep busy and be active. In 2005 Merit began a business selling chips (french fries) in the Nyalenda neighborhood of Kisumu.<p>\r\n\r\nMerit chose chips because her parents used to have a similar business and she grew up knowing how to cook and sell chips profitably. Merit purchases about 10 kilograms of potatoes from the Kibuye Market in Kisumu weekly. On a busy day she can sell about half her stock.<p>\r\n\r\nBecause she has this business, Merit is able to provide for herself and to eat what she wants. She says she doesn\u2019t need to rely on anyone else. <p>\r\n\r\nMerit has applied for her first loan from K-MET, of approximately $275. She plans to use this money towards purchasing a machine to fry the chips. If she has a machine, the chips will cook faster and then Merit will not lose customers to long waiting times. Merit would also like to purchase a fridge so that she can sell cold soda with the chips.

Before his family moved to Baganuur city, he was a herder who took care of over 100 animals, mostly sheep and goats. However, he wanted to live in the city; therefore, he sold all his livestock to buy a pick-up truck to start a transport business. Now he transports all sorts of loads, picking up and dropping off grocery store goods, moving furniture, etc. Sometimes he purchases coal from the local coal mine, bags it, and sells it out of his truck (most Mongolians who live in the traditional nomad's \"ger\" heat their homes with coal against the frigid winter nights). This pick-up truck is the family's only source of income. He is requesting a loan to buy tires and other supplies for his truck. One day, he wants to build his own house in his yard.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is married and is responsible for supporting five people. Not having had the opportunity to advance very far in his studies, he quickly began an apprenticeship in a shop specializing in the repair and sale of used refrigerators. At the end of his apprenticeship, he opened his own shop reparing and selling refrigerators. Thanks to his expertise, he has earned the trust of his clientele. He is requesting a loan to purchase work materials and used freezers to repair and resell. This will greatly contribute to the increase of sales and profit for his shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva

Her children are grown now and can take care of themselves so she has plenty of free time.  She started the business in February 2006, on the patio of her house, selling used clothes.  Later, a neighbor gave her the idea to buy bundles of used clothes which were selling very cheaply and quickly turn them around.  Things have been going well ever since.

pero como esta ruta desapareci\u00f3  el gobierno los apoy\u00f3 d\u00e1ndonos concesiones de Taxi pero el tuvo que adquirir el Taxi, con el cual le ha ido muy bien y ya esta pensando, incluso quiere

at any one place to get a pension.  He had to find another way to help himself so he started this business in May 2002 after the government sold him a concession to operate a cab.  Before that, he used to work on a \"transporte de ruta fija\" (a bus or vehicle that operates along a set route), but the route was dropped and the government extended the concession to operate a cab.

She will use part of this S\/.2,000 loan, to be repaid in 6 months, to buy cell-phone charge cards and the rest to buy merchandise for her grocery business: sacks of rice, pasta, sugar, cold drinks, etc.  Nuvith is very happy to be part of her community bank because it gives her a chance to grow and, as a woman, to help her to protect herself.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":275725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy products for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juanjui - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-7.183333 -76.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T21:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuvith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":340.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20418266,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":340.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111774,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":340.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006966,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":333.32,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":340.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590617,"comment":null},{"amount":104.27,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":340.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984863,"comment":null},{"amount":104.07,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":339.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205274,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T00:34:48Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":90604,"name":"Los Sauces Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \" Los Sauces \" esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Rissy y conformado por 12 miembros dentro de los cuales existen dos hermanas,  la se\u00f1ora Maria Luisa y Modestina, ambas tiene ingresos totalmente independientes y son capaces de cumplir con sus propias obligaciones.

She is very happy with her business as she feels she is helping those who still use firewood for fuel.  Juana hopes to build a storage area in her home where she could keep the firewood so that it would not get wet during the rainy season because what she does not like to see is wood left unsold because it is wet.

Some of the group's members have a lot of experience with communal banking and for others this is their first loan, but they feel capable, as a group and as clients of the Agrocapital Foundation, of making their payments punctually and taking advantage of the great opportunities this loan will bring. \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":275793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-03-03T04:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guicela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dica Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Delcy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aleida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1800.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1821.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1842.46},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1863.66},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.1},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.8},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1928.74},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1950.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":258.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":261.08},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":264.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.31},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":783.28,"local_amount":5464.74,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5498.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091177,"comment":null},{"amount":267.12,"local_amount":1863.66,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1875.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091178,"comment":null},{"amount":270.19,"local_amount":1885.1,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1896.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984498,"comment":null},{"amount":273.3,"local_amount":1906.8,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1918.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984499,"comment":null},{"amount":276.45,"local_amount":1928.74,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1940.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984500,"comment":null},{"amount":279.66,"local_amount":1950.96,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1963.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445073,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-05T18:36:57Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:01:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":90633,"name":"Comite Nueva Esperanza Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Comit\u00e9 Nueva Esperanza II as\u00ed se denomina el grupo conformado en fecha 11 de julio  del 2008, integrado por 21 mujeres  quienes se encuentran trabajando con el Programa de Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendoras, ya en el 3\u00ba ciclo.\n\nEste grupo se form\u00f3 gracias a que la actual Directora de Finanzas la Sra.

She lives independently in her parents' home and longs to be able to give her beloved son a good occupation.  Nora walks around the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca) selling CDs from a small cart she transports all her stock, covering the entire market in search of customers to buy her CDs.  She has lower prices than other vendors and because of this many people prefer to buy from her.  Nora longs to have a little stall in the market where she can sell her goods without having to walk so much as that is what she likes the least about her work.  She has been in this business for 10 years and she enjoys speaking with her clients whom she always treats pleasantly and always convinces to buy a CD.

","en":"The 'Nueva Esperanza' (New Hope) group is represented by Ricardo, and is made up of 12 members including one mother and son: Sandra and her son Isaac Freddy. All of the members have incomes independent of each other, so there is no risk of dependence within the group. The majority of the members work selling products including cosmetics, meat, party favours, food, clothing and groceries, or work in the service sector offering computer repair, house painting and public transport services. \r\n\r\nWithin the commercial sphere there is competition between supply and demand, and the members rely on being able to offer high quality products at low prices. They also draw on their capacity to make progress despite any obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy basic supplies and materials to improve their businesses, increase their income and improve the quality of life for their families. Within the group some members have previous experience with solidarity groups, while others are receiving their first loans but feel able to fulfil their obligations to the group and to the Agrocapital Foundation, which offers them the opportunity of credit on favourable terms.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sally Bolton, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":275814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-03-03T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jassivi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaquelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15500,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1860.8},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1882.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1903.87},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1925.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1947.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1970.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1993.03},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2016}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":270.19},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":273.3},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":276.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.84},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.1},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":810.6,"local_amount":5646.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5690.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091183,"comment":null},{"amount":276.44,"local_amount":1925.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1940.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091184,"comment":null},{"amount":279.62,"local_amount":1947.94,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1962.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984506,"comment":null},{"amount":282.84,"local_amount":1970.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984507,"comment":null},{"amount":286.1,"local_amount":1993.03,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:59:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445077,"comment":null},{"amount":289.4,"local_amount":2016,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2031.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445078,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-06T21:25:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
