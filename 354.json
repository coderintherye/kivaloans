She is 29 years old, is married, and has a four year old son who is not yet yet in school. She studied through 11th grade but didn't continue because of her parents' lack of financial resources. She lives along with her sister in the house of other relatives, and is not helping to support anyone else. \r\n.\r\nShe left Matola for Boane with her parents when she was young, and Boane is where she still lives. She's been working as a teacher for 4 years, as part of the Ministry of Education, and she studied in the Centro de Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de Professores [Teacher Education Center]. She works around 6 hours a day and has a salary of  6.350.00mt per month, which she puts towards household expenses, also saving some each month in her bank account. \r\n\r\nLuisa Celsia has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku through some colleagues who are also customers of the institution. This is her third loan, in the amount of 20.000.00mt. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (zinc plates, cement, doors and windows) to continue with her project. The earlier loans were for 10.000.00mt and 20.000.00mt, both for the same undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish the project and offer her family a more

He is 39 years old, married, and has two children who are 1 and 5 years old. Neither is currently in school. He studied through the 10th grade but didn't continue because of his parents' lack of financial resources. He lives in his own home with his family and is not helping to support anyone else. \r\n\r\nBernardo left Inhambane for Maputo with his parents when he was 7 years old. Later he moved to the Massaca neighborhood in the district of Boane with his family. He has his own business, raising and selling broiler chickens. He has owned two chicken coops for the past 2 years and does not employ any outside help. He buys the baby chicks for 18.00mt and sells the grown chickens for 90.00mt. This business gives him a monthly income of almost 5.000.00mt, which he uses to pay household expenses. He is also able to save some money in his bank account each month. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans with other banks. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva field partner] through friends of his who are also customers of the institution. This is his 2nd loan, in the amount of 18.000.00mt. He plans to use this money to buy products (baby chicks, feed, vaccines and other items) to continue with his business venture. His previous loan was for 15.000.00mt and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nBernardo promises to repay the loan as stated, so that he can get other loans in the future. He would like to borrow more money to build more chicken coops and continue developing his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She is 40 years old and is a single mother of three children, ages 20, 17, and 7.  All three go to school.  She only finished eighth grade; she didn't continue because of financial problems.  She lives in her own house with her family and has no dependents besides her children.\r\n\r\nShe left the airport district in Maputo city to go to Boane District in 2007 with her children.  She has had her own business for more than 15 years.  She works from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm and has no employees.  She learned this job with her cousin who also runs the same type of business.  She sells flour, powdered milk, yogurt and coffee.  She makes around 5,000 MZN per month, which she uses for household expenses and even manages to put some money in her bank account every month.\r\n\r\nShe has taken out loans before with the TCHUMA micro-finance association, but she decided not to continue with them for various reasons.  She heard about Hluvuku through her cousin, who is also a client of this institution.  This is her second loan.  She asks for 15,000 MZN, which she will use to buy products (flour, rice, powdered milk, coffee and other items) to increase her inventory.  The first loan was for 7,000 MZN for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she will be able to get other loans.  In the future, she would like to take out more loans in order to expand her shop and meet her customers' demands.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

M. was born in the city of Maputo, in southern Mozambique.  She is 44 years old, is separated from her husband and is the mother of 3 children aged 21, 17, and 14.  They all attend school.  Valentina only completed eighth graD.; she did not continue because of an early pregnancy.  Her husband did not allow her to return to school after the baby's birth.  She lives in her own house with her niece because her children stayed with their father after their separation.  She supports her mother, who does not live with her, by sending her money and food.\r\n\r\nShe left the city of Matola to go to Boane seven years after the separation.  She is still living in this district with her niece.  She has had her own business for more than seven years.  She works about 12 hours per day selling beer and soft drinks, and she has no employees.  Valentina learned this job with some friends who lived in her neighborhood in Matola.  She makes about 5,000 MZN per month, which she uses for household expenses while saving some money at home for unexpected expenses.\r\n\r\nValentina has never taken out loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client here.  This is Valentina's fourth loan.  She is asking for 15,000 MZN, which she will use to buy products (soft drinks, beer, wine and other products) to increase her inventory.  The other loans were for 9,000 MZN, 1,000 MZN, and 10,000 MZN.  The other loans were used for the same purpose.  In the future, she would like to ask for more loans in order to build a shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":514.69,"image":{"id":490916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase and sale of beverages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T17:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.31,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentina Da Conceicao ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.86},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.27,"local_amount":2322,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-20T08:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938340,"comment":null},{"amount":78.25,"local_amount":2235.76,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2291.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698684,"comment":null},{"amount":50.72,"local_amount":1449.28,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916153,"comment":null},{"amount":175.5,"local_amount":5308.9,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5440.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.31,"payment_id":159878572,"comment":null},{"amount":0.34,"local_amount":9.53,"processed_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-25T08:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195866270,"comment":null},{"amount":40.99,"local_amount":1171.11,"processed_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201307521,"comment":null},{"amount":42.84,"local_amount":1224.05,"processed_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-02T08:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206176285,"comment":null},{"amount":44.78,"local_amount":1279.37,"processed_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-28T07:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1311.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211249932,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-27T00:41:47Z","paid_date":"2011-06-28T07:54:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":177263,"name":"Melia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melia D. is from the village of Bacnor East.

She is 25 years old, is married and has three children aged 7, 4, and 1.  The eldest attends school.  Marta only finished fourth grade; she couldn't continue for financial reasons.  She lives in her own house with relatives and has no dependents other than her family.\r\n\r\nWhen Marta was young, she left Machava to move to Boane with her parents because they had machambas (small family farms).  After her marriage she continued living in Boane, where she started her business.  She works from 7:00 am until 6:00 pm everyday selling pots that she buys for 5,000 MZN and sells for 8,500 MZN.  She has no employees.  From this business she earns about 3,500 MZN per month, which she uses for household expenses and even manages to put something in the bank.\r\n\r\nMarta has never taken out loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients here.  This is her fourth loan.  She is asking for 11,000 MZN, with which she wants to buy materials (zinc sheets, stone, cement, sand and other materials) to continue building her house.  Her previous loans were for 3,100 MZN, 8,000 MZN and 10,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can receive more loans.  In the future, she would like to ask for more loans so she can finish her house and buy some type of transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

A. is from the village of Agusan Canyon, Manolo Fortich Bukidnon. She is 35 years old. Maritess is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $220 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maritess joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Maritess is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 5th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is one of the very active members of ASHI. She is 50 years of age and is blessed with four loving and supportive children whose age range is from 11 to 24 years old. Despite poverty and a difficult way of surviving, Sylvia still feels happy and courageous because of the love and inspiration her husband (named Joyce) gives her all the time. He works as a village policeman and is receiving a small honorarium every month. They would not have been able to cover the expenses of their children if not for Sylvia\u2019s small business. She joined ASHI, a Kiva field partner in the Philippines, and thereafter she had the opportunity to request loans which enable her to support and grow her sweetened-peanut and sweetened-cashew nut-selling business. \r\n\r\nSylvia started with this business by selling the nuts herself in the market, but she was making only a small profit. Her customers were not as regular as before and were not purchasing large amounts of her product. After several times of receiving loans in increasing amounts through ASHI, Sylvia\u2019s volume of production increased and her business became capable of supplying the demands of her customers. \r\n\r\nShe wants to expand even further, especially now that she is supplying three stall owners in the market who sell \u201cpasalubong\u201d, which in the English language means a souvenir or homecoming present (a Filipino cultural tradition). Consequently, Sylvia would like to request a much larger loan this time from Kiva through ASHI. \r\n\r\nThe proceeds from her business will be spent for her children\u2019s education, which is the only reason for her continued determination. Sylvia believes that through her business the lives of her children will be different from hers and her husband\u2019s.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":490943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

fish in Nigeria is an essential ingredient in the preparation of local soup like egusi (Melon soup). The demands for dried fish are high in Nigeria. \r\n\r\nBeauty sells dried fish to make a living in Sapele. She loves this business because of the one-on-one interaction that she has with her customers. She sells her dried fish in the market.

K. is 37 years old and single, with one child, 17 years old. Her business, known by the name Bimas, is located in a commercial building on Mama Ngina Sreet in the central business district of Kenya's capital city, Nairobi. She has been selling pesticides, acaricides and other agrochemicals to farmers for the last two years. She says that this business is profitable. Her major challenge is that her products are not bought throughout the year due to the seasonal nature of farming. However, she works very hard to keep her business going well. Before starting this business, Miilicent worked for Coopers, a company which specializes in selling agrochemicals. She left that job and currently works for British American Insurance. She is using her loan of KES 50,000 to buy more agrochemicals to expand her business. She hopes to open more outlets all over the country. She also hopes to study and join the best university in Kenya.  She is very hardworking, determined, ambitious and outgoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":490977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

To make a living, Elias runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Elias has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elias joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elias is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This will be the first loan taken out by Elias from ASKI.

is 36 years old.

Mila is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Mila from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

His previous loans allowed him to continually improve his work as a blacksmith, and also his financiA. situation. <P>\r\n\r\nSalah is speciA. in his work because he does it well. His clients are his friends, neighbors, and people from his region. When he first started his business, he didn\u2019t have enough cash to have all the required tools. Salah decided on doing his business because he wanted to have an independent job which allows him to set his own schedule and work as a taxi driver. In future, he plans to keep on improving his businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":491105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

Young people sometimes have to miss school in order to work and help their parents with the farming.\r\n\r\nMiguel is also a carpenter.

She joined ASHI, a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2005. During the course of her membership, she has been an excellent performer with respect to regular attendance at meetings, loan repayment, and projects. She is now seeking her sixth loan, in the amount of 40,000 PHP, to purchase additional inventory of fish.\r\n\r\nWith access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, Elisa is hopeful that her dreams of sending her children to a university to complete college degrees will be achieved.  She also hopes to build a more durable house made of concrete, and to purchase a car to support her business.

Her dream for the future is for her children to pursue an education and become a professional such as an engineer or an artist.  The work in the fields is very difficult and requires a lot of manual labor.  She is not able to acquire machinery because it is too expensive.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

As a result, he is not able to earn money and recoup the investment from his crops.\r\n<p>\r\nManuel is requesting a loan to purchase farming supplies such as compost, seeds, urea, and other items.  He enjoys living on a farm instead of in the city because there is more freedom.

She is an enterprising businesswoman who lives in the neighborhood of La Playa in Barranquilla.  She is 63 years old and has three children between the ages of 23 and 42.  Miriam manages a business selling different types of merchandise based on the time of year.  With the loan of 1,500,000 COP that she is requesting, she will buy fabrics and accessories (such as borders) for making uniforms for the local high school.\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cEverything for less\u201d is the slogan for Miriam\u2019s business where she sells many things.  For ten years, she sold school shoes and for seven years, she sold ice cream and catalog merchandise.  Her business now includes the production and sale of \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chicha\" target=\"_blank\" >chicha<\/a>\u201d, a beverage made from corn or rice, and \u201cbolis\u201d (a traditional form of ice cream found in Colombia).

In addition she sells merchandise through catalog or by request such as shoes, women\u2019s accessories (earrings, costume jewelry, etc.), and reading material.  \r\n<p>\r\nMiriam learned about the Foundation five years ago from neighbors and through other recommendations.  Since then she has taken out seven loans.   Miriam is very careful with her loans and tries to take advantage of all of the services offered by the Foundation, such as the licensing program provided through the Chamber of Commerce.  She also enjoys fun activities, such as playing bingo or taking walks.  The courses she has taken have updated her knowledge in selling products that are always in fashion.  Miriam believes her working relationship with the Foundation has been a positive experience, so she remains active and tries to obtain as much as she can as long as the benefits are useful.  She now dreams of finishing the home in which she lives with her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

L. lives with her husband and two children (ages 8 and 2) in the neighborhood of Ciudadela 20 de Julio, near the Metropolitan Stadium in Barranquilla.  She sells clothing, cosmetics, and variety of other merchandise.  Mileinis started her business in 2006 by selling merchandise through specialty catalogs.  It is very common to see her customers get excited when Milenis visits them so that they can thumb through the catalog and select the products they need.  She sells wholesale, retail, and through cash transactions.  When her customers request items that are not listed in the catalog, she writes down their orders and responds by delivering the exact items.  Because her business is very precise and requires timely delivery to her target audience, Milenis needs a loan of 1,000,000 COP to purchase clothing to fulfill her outstanding orders.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she started working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, her customer base has increased.  The assistance she has received has resulted in a higher income and better living standards.  Her husband has proposed to increase their daily income and is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep their household progressing.  Her biggest challenge last year was buying a home since it required a lot savings, effort, and sacrifice.  She proposes to devote more time to promoting her micro-business so that it continues to run successfully.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

By owning her own transportation, Maxima will save time and money in purchasing a greater variety of inventory as well as selling products in additional territories.

She believes that insurance is very important and necessary, because no one is completely immune from accidents on the job or in the streets.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":485075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Cosmetics for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987611,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713640,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":225.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746687,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929844,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159669013,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":225.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172149941,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T23:16:10Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:22:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":177500,"name":"Lucia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucia C. is from Barangay Buhangin, Binangonan, Rizal.

solicit\u00f3, ella pudo abrir su primer negocio, en la venta de balones de gas para cocina, donde ella misma los trasportaba y repart\u00eda, cabe mencionar que es un trabajo que no cualquier mujer

She is 41 years old and the mother of two small children who have depended on her since her husband abandoned her.  She has learned to be a single mother with a desire to come out ahead by being responsible, dynamic, and active.\r\n\r\nIt all began six years ago, when Yobana felt the need to start her own business, independent from that of her, then, husband.  This is when she learned of EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD.  Thanks to the loan she received, she was able to start her own business selling cylinders of gas for cooking, which she transported and delivered.  This is not a job that can be done by just ANY woman.\r\n\r\nYobana then requested additional loans through EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD, which allowed her to open another one of her businesses.  Little by little she opened a small grocery shop in her home, which she runs with the help of her children.\r\n\r\nAnother one of her business, which she calls a hobby, is teaching girls to play volleyball.  She is very passionate about this sport and rarely misses the opportunity to play on the weekends.\r\n\r\nShe also sells Esika beauty products, which she promotes within her other businesses; to her gas customers, to her neighbors from her grocery shop, and to her fellow volleyball players.\r\n\r\nYobana has gotten a lot from her efforts, like being able to pay for her children\u2019s education, having her own shop in her home, and being able to give her children all that she could give them with all her heart.  One of her dreams is to have a large store where she can sell anything she thinks of.  She will not fail because she will give her all to get what she desires.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

H\u00e9ctor decided to start his own business since he had trouble finding work because of problems with his hearing.  He finds managing his business to be quite peaceful and also has the help of his wife and daughter.  Despite his age, H\u00e9ctor has many projects planned to improve the quality of life for his family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  H\u00e9ctor promises to complete each of his payments on time because he wants to receive subsequent loans for as long as he can.  He plans to use the money he requested to buy merchandise so that he can increase his inventory and offer a greater variety of products to his customers.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Over time she has expanded her business.  She still remembers that when she first opened, her shop was almost empty because she had few items in stock.  Today she sells a variety of products such as groceries, beverages, and most recently gas (for home use).  Marlene enjoys her work because it provides a distraction.  However, she is not able to get out much because she has to attend to the store, which generates good profits that allow her to buy necessities for her home.  Since she is a woman who is not afraid of hard work, Marlene has plans to expand her facilities and stock her business with a greater quantity of products because her customers rely on her business to provide everything they need.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Marlene is very grateful to everyone who has made it possible for her to move forward with her business.  She plans to use the money to buy more merchandise to restock her shop.  In addition, she will buy notebooks for the school season since they sell very well.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":491400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase merchadise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T12:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1067.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449226,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T23:37:43Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":177562,"name":"Wilson Higidio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestro socio Wilson, pertenece al banco comunal  \u201cNUEVA VISION DE URUBAMBA\u201d, nuestro socio est\u00e1 ubicado en el coraz\u00f3n del valle sagrado de los inkas, Urubamba est\u00e1 a 1 hora 10 minutos de la ciudad del Cusco.\n\nNuestro socio se dedica al comercio minorista, \u00e9l es separado y tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, el socio tiene 2 hijos de 20 y 16 a\u00f1os de edad, Nuestro socio tiene un peque\u00f1o taller de confecciones y ha comprado anteriormente las maquinas industriales, ahora \u00e9l socio solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para poder comprar telas para el negocio.

Bland\u00f3n has property measuring 8 manzanas (traditional Central American unit of measurement) that\u2019s divided into several areas for use:  two manzanas are for farming (corn and beans) and six manzanas are for cattle raising.\r\n\r\nThis type of product is sold to direct buyers that come in their trucks to the communities to buy grains.  He will use the funds to buy a bullock to raise.  He needs to buy the bull so that he can make a two-ox team.  He only has one now and needs a second one in order to have the team to plow his farmlands for planting.  He, himself, does all the land preparation for planting in an artisanal way; in other words, he could plow the land with machinery (a tractor is more expensive and that type of machinery is unavailable in his area).  So, he does it with two oxen but he only has one and he needs the other one.  This affects him adversely because when the planting season approaches, he has to lease or pay others to do this service for him.  However, they are only available to him after they finish their own plowing and planting so he has to wait to plant even later.  This can cause him to lose the planting cycle.\r\n\r\nHe started the business as a young boy farming his parents\u2019 lands.  That is where he gained experience.  He used his savings to buy 4 manzanas, which correspond to part of his total spread; the other part he inherited from his parents.\r\n\r\nThis client\u2019s main occupation is farming.  He does this twice a year:  Cycle One: Spring, May to August; Cycle Two: Post-Season, from September to December.  These are winter agricultural harvest seasons.  With the purchase of this bull, he will have the two bulls he needs and will have the bulls available in winter so that he can plant at the moment he desires according to the planting cycle.\r\n\r\nRigoberto T. has had two previous loans for this activity, which is very important in this economic sector.  He has collaborated with Ceprodel for two years.\r\n\r\nThese loans have had important positive impact in that they made it possible for him to improve his farming activities obtaining benefits that give him a better way to do his planting activities.  As a result, his crops insure larger income so that gradually he improves his standard of living as a small producer.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":491433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a bullock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rigoberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4482.38,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4482.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":4482.38,"processed_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4719.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172090742,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T04:06:15Z","paid_date":"2010-10-20T08:07:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":177580,"name":"Josefa Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Josefa Esperanza tiene 49 a\u00f1os, su actividad econ\u00f3mica es una pulper\u00eda.

Con este fin, se mud\u00f3 al barrio La Ceiba porque siente que en un barrio de mejor ambiente familiar y m\u00e1s prosperidad, as\u00ed que la gente es m\u00e1s estudiosa y son un muy buen ejemplo.\nAntes trabajaba en una casa de familia a cuyo due\u00f1o lo contrataba una empresa para lavar ropa. Gradualmente el se\u00f1or no pudo responder y por el comportamiento de Blanca la hicieron cargo de esta actividad. Luego se independiz\u00f3 y abri\u00f3 su propia lavander\u00eda, donde comenz\u00f3 con una lavadora de uso personal que le regal\u00f3 su esposo. Durante m\u00e1s de diez a\u00f1os en la lavander\u00eda con la ayuda de la Fundaci\u00f3n, el negocio le ha dado para comprar otras dos lavadoras, por eso se siente agradecida con la Fundaci\u00f3n por la ayuda que le ha otorgado; a nivel personal su negocio le ha proporcionado  independencia y ahora se siente m\u00e1s segura de s\u00ed misma.\n","en":"\r\n\r\nBlanca In\u00e9s C. owns the Blanquiset laundry which is located in her home.  She also sells products from specialized catalogues.  She lives in Barranquilla's La Ceiba neighborhood with her husband and three children, who range in ages from 24 to 18.  She has been associated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for over 10 years.  During this time she has seen her business grow thanks to the loans from this organization.\r\n\r\nRecently, her eldest daughter graduated from university and she is now requesting funding to pay for her second daughter's university education in the field of nursing.  She highly values education for her children and is looking for ways to provide for her youngest, who is still under her charge.  This is the reason why she moved to the La Ceiba neighborhood because it's more family oriented and more prosperous so the residents there tend to be more studious and set a good example.\r\n\r\nShe used to work in a private home, the owner of which worked for a laundry service.  Gradually, he began to fall short of expectations and, because of Blanca's behavior, she was asked to take over the business.  Later on, she became independent and opened her own laundry which she started with a home washing machine that her husband gave her.  Over these ten years, with help from the Fundaci\u00f3n, the business has produced enough to buy two more washing machines.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for the help it has given her.  On a personal level, her business has provided her with independence and now she feels more sure of herself.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":491443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay for her daughter's college education.

Criselda successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from GDMPC. Criselda is requesting her fourth loan from GDMPC, for 15000 PHP, which she will invest in her business.

It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nNote<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
