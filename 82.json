In the future she would like to have a business that will help her maintain herself in her old age.  She is asking for a loan in order to expand her kitchen.  Her focus has always been on keeping her house well-maintained and having a nice home that can help to fill her loneliness.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Zoila  S., es una mujer trabajadora que siempre se ha valido por si misma, tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad habita en el Barrio Memorial Sandino, vive acompa\u00f1ada con su sobrina que trabaja como Secretaria ejecutiva  en el Hospital Bautista.

is a dedicated mother and business owner who, despite difficult life circumstances, is working hard to make a better life for her family. Ludmila is a widow. She has four children: three boys and a girl. Her oldest son was married for a year, but his wife died and he was left with a baby son to raise. Ludmila lives with her children and wants to use her income to help support her family. She started her clothing sales business about five years ago, after deciding that since she always went to the market to buy clothing, others would too. So it would be a good business to get into. With hard work, perseverance, and financial assistance from Nadiya Ukraine, she has developed a successful business.

She is a single mother of 3 children. She lost her father at a early age but thanks to herself, and her mother's dedication, she was able to graduate from high school and she's been working at the Interior Ministry since 1980. She realized that that position's salary was not enough to support herself and she felt obligated to start a business as a way to increase income and meet daily expenses. She began by selling imported clothes in 1993, and, later on, she was able to set up a store. Two small commercial establishments (tents) were built; her son ran one of them and she ran the other. She became aware of HLUVUKU-ADSEMA in 2006 and in the following year she requested her first loan which was used for business expansion. The loan was repaid in record time and without any difficulties. With the proceeds from the businesses she was able to purchase a vehicle and cover her family's living expenses - not an easy task for a single mother. Her stores have a positive impact in the community because they supply sodas and other basic goods to residents in the Zone 4. With this 25,000.00 MT loan she plans to increase merchandise volume to avoid stock gaps and unnecessary, out-of-town purchasing trips. In the future, she wants to build a home for herself and allow her mother and sisters to occupy the old one. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7ao : Bairro 4 - Boane\r\nCliente: Isabel Salvador D.\r\nActividade: Comercio\r\nValor de empr\u00e9stimo: 25.000,00 MT\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do montante:Compra e venda de produtos da 1\u00aa necessidade \r\nInicio: 29\/02\/2008  \r\nFim: 30\/06\/2009\r\n\r\nIsabel Salvador D., nasceu a 23de Agosto de 1958 em Boane, solteira m\u00e3e de 3 filhos.\r\nFicou \u00f3rf\u00e3 de pai muito cedo mas com  esfor\u00e7o pr\u00f3prio e da sua m\u00e3e conseguiu fazer o n\u00edvel M\u00e9dio e trabalha no Minist\u00e9rio do Interior desde 1980.\r\nVisto que  o sal\u00e1rio n\u00e3o correspondia com as suas necessidades, viu-se obrigada a abrir um negocio como forma de refor\u00e7ar a ajuda para as necessidades do dia a dia .\r\nCome\u00e7ou por vender roupas estrangeiras em 1993 e mais tarde teve um negocio fixo.

In 1984, she divorced her husband and, along with her daughter, moved in with her parents. A war broke out in 1985 and the Secondary School in Manhica, where she worked as a tailor, had to shut its doors.

In 2000, he started working at the Umpala's Junior High School as a teacher. In that same year he got married and had two children - the eldest is now 7 years old. Currently he works at the Primary School in the district of Boane. He has worked with other credit institutionsin the past, such as Tchurma and Procredito. He stoped working with those companies because he realized that HLUVUKU's services were better, their interest rate was lower and it was located closer to his residence.  He found out about HLUVUKU ADSEMA through friends and co-workers. He was awarded a loan in the amount of 12,000.00 MT for housing purposes, which was repaid without any problems. He intends to use the loan amount of 15,000.00 MT to continue the construction project, more specifically to purchase cement and sand to build walls. In the future, he plans to seek more credit so that he can continue to improve his quality of life. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nJo\u00e3o Francisco C. nasceu em Majacaze Prov\u00edncia de Gaza em 1978.\r\nTem 9 irm\u00e3os sendo ele o s\u00e9timo filho.\r\nEsta a estudar ate ent\u00e3o  na Universidade Pedag\u00f3gica em Maputo frequentando o segundo ano de licenciatura.\r\nViveu na responsabilidade dos pais ate 1999 altura em que veio viver com o irm\u00e3o em Boane durante 5 anos .\r\nEm 2000  come\u00e7ou a trabalhar na Escola Primaria de Umpala como professor.

What is happening is that the members of the group are looking for their friends who are not present in the Friendship Bridge office for the payment.  Until all the clients of the communal bank are present, the loan cannot be repaid.  For many of the clients, the repayment of the loan is one of the most important events of the month.\r\n<p>\r\nThe meeting begins five minutes late, but with all members of the group in the office.  Many are a little anxious but happy to receive their first loan.  Others reflect the shyness typical of new clients.  This shyness will fade away in time, as the group consolidates and they all receive training about self-esteem and women\u2019s rights, among other themes of interest.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll the clients work in the textile industry. The majority work in traditional fabrics. Meanwhile others embroider flowers and birds in the typical blouses of the region. Finally, the rest of the group buys and sells clothes and traditional dress.  They are going to use the loan to buy the thread and clothes of their respective resale.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is believed that once the clients start to receive a loan their opportunities and dreams will begin to flourish.  The women would like to learn about administration of their business.  By luck, Friendship Bridge offers training in the themes in which the clients have interest.  This basic training helps the women very much, especially those who are new to microfinance.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSurprisingly, the common dream among everyone is that their respective business can grow so that they can support and send their children to school. It is in our hands to support these women with their noble goals.  Few people spend so much effort for the benefit of others.  It is an admirable characteristic that people worldwide should imitate, and with our help these women can realize their dreams.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Katrina H, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Diez minutos antes de empezar la reuni\u00f3n de desembolso del grupo \u201cel Rosario Nahuala\u201d uno pod\u00eda ver grupos de se\u00f1oras, en sus trajes t\u00edpicos, corriendo por las calles de Nahuala gritando los nombres de sus compa\u00f1eras en el idioma Quich\u00e9. Lo que pasaba era que las integrantes del grupo estaban buscando a sus compa\u00f1eras que no estaban presentes en la oficina de Friendship Bridge para el desembolso, y hasta que no est\u00e9n todas las clientas del banco comunal el pr\u00e9stamo no se puede desembolsar. Para muchas de las clientas el desembolso del pr\u00e9stamo es uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s importantes del mes. \r\n\r\n<P>La reuni\u00f3n empez\u00f3 cinco minutos tarde, pero ya con todas las integrantes del grupo en la oficina. Muchas de ellas estaban un poco ansiosas pero felices por \u00a1recibir su primer pr\u00e9stamo! Otras, reflejaban aquella timidez t\u00edpica de clientes nuevas. Esa timidez se va borrando a trav\u00e9s del tiempo conforme el grupo se vaya consolidando y ellas vayan a recibiendo capacitaciones sobre autoestima y derechos de la mujer entre otros temas de su inter\u00e9s. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las clientas trabajan en la industria textil. La mayor\u00eda trabaja en tejidos tradicionales. Mientras que otras bordan flores y aves en las blusas t\u00edpicas de la regi\u00f3n. Finalmente, el resto del grupo compra y vende ropa y trajes tradicionales. Ellas van a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de hilo y ropa para su respectiva reventa.\r\n\r\n<P>Se cree que una vez las clientas empiezan a recibir pr\u00e9stamos sus horizontes y sue\u00f1os empiezan a agrandarse. A las se\u00f1oras les gustar\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s sobre administraci\u00f3n de sus negocios y medicinas. Por suerte, Friendship Bridge ofrece capacitaciones en los temas que las clientas est\u00e1n interesadas. Este tipo de capacitaciones b\u00e1sica ayuda mucho a las mujeres, especialmente a las que reci\u00e9n empiezan en las microfinanzas.\r\n\r\n<P>Sorprendentemente, el sue\u00f1o com\u00fan de todas es que su respectivo negocio pueda crecer para que as\u00ed puedan alimentar y mandar a sus hijos al colegio. Est\u00e1 en nuestras manos apoyar a estas se\u00f1oras con sus nobles metas. Pocas personas avocan todos sus esfuerzos para el beneficios de otros. Esto es una caracter\u00edstica intachable de la cual muchas personas en el mundo deber\u00edan de imitar y solo con su apoyo estas se\u00f1oras van a poder cumplir sus sue\u00f1os."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":140214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase

He decided later to quit this job and start his own business.  With effort he was able to buy the tools needed for his business.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a result of good customer service and a low price for his quality service, he was able to increase his list of clients.

He also raises calves, sheep and goats in a small barn that he owns and sells the animals after fattening them. Since the prices for livestock are currently slightly lower, he wants to buy more sheep and goats. However, Alisher needs additional funding for this purchase and he has decided to take out this loan. This way he will be able to expand his herd and increase the earnings from animal sales.

He is 39 years old, married and has 4 children. He has a high school degree and works as a builder for hire. He also farms on the plot of land that he owns, where he grows wheat and potatoes. Latif has been farming for the last 20 years. Most of his harvest Latif sells at the market, but keeps some for family needs. Currently it is planting season in Tajikistan and Latif wants to buy high quality seeds of potatoes and wheat, but they cost more then regular seeds. Planting quality seeds will ensure that Latif will collect a big harvest of quality crops which will attract new clients. Also, this will provide the local markets with quality grain and potatoes for purchase. To be able to buy the seeds Latif needs additional funding, and that is why he decided to take out this loan. He is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432

R. lives in the Varzob region of Tajikistan. He is 59 years old, married and has 6 children. Qurbon has a professional degree as a driver. He works as a taxi driver on the Dushanbe-Vazrob route. He has a small income from this, but not enough for living. That is why Qurbon supplements his earnings by raising cattle. He has a small barn where he keeps cattle and goats. He purchases young calves, feeds them then sells the animals at the market at a higher price. His cattle business earnings support his family. Qurbon would like to purchase more calves to enlarge his herd and for that he requires this loan. Currently it is a good deal to buy meat cattle, since the animals are thin after the winter and are sold at a lower price. Qurbon has been raising and selling cattle for the last 20 years. He is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0432

Ziedullaevich B. lives in the Varzob region of Tajikistan. He is 29 years old, married and has 4 children. Shukrullo has a college degree in education. Currently he works as a contractor for hire, but his salary is not enough to support his family. That is why Shukrullo supplements the family income by raising cattle for sale. He has a small barn where he keeps his animals. Shukrullo purchases young calves, feeds them then sells the animals at the market at a higher price. His cattle business earnings supplement the family income. However, he would like to purchase more calves to expand his business and for that he requires this loan. Currently it is a good deal to buy meat cattle, since the animals are thin after the winter and are sold at a lower price. Shukrullo has been raising and selling cattle for the last 10 years. He is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432

Her business earnings supplement the family income. Bibimohsharifa would like to purchase more calves to expand her business and for that she requires this loan. Currently it is a good deal to buy meat cattle, since the animals are thin after the winter and are sold at a lower price. Bibimohsharifa has been raising and selling cattle for the last 20 years.

A. lives in the Varzob region of Tajikistan.She is 73 years old, widowed and has 1 child. Sharifa has a high school degree and raises cattle for a living. Sharifa owns a small barn where she keeps her calves. She purchases animals at the market, fattens them and then sells for a higher price. This helps her support herself and her family. Sharifa wants to buy one more calf but for that she needs to take out a loan. Currently the prices on cattle are lower, since the animals are thinner after the winter. Sharifa has been raising cattle for the last 20 years and she is planning to pay back the credit in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

I. has been saving money to fix the apartment for a while and the repairs have finally begun, but now she needs 3000 more somoni. I. decided not to wait for her husband to send more money but to turn to Microinvest and take out a loan, so that the repairs in the apartment can proceed without interruptions.

Sharipovna S. lives in the city of Vahdat. She is 46 years old, married and has 6 children. She has a high school degree. Husniya is a housewife but her main occupation as well as the main source of income for her family is agriculture. She rents a plot of land where she grows wheat and potatoes. After harvest she keeps part of the crops for her family and sells the rest. She has been doing this for the last 15 years. Currently it is planting season in Tajikistan and Husniya requires additional funding to purchase seeds of wheat, potatoes and fertilizer. That is why she has planned to take out this loan. This loan will help her buy quality seeds and harvest a quality harvest which will help her attract new clients and be able to sell all the crops she grows. Husniya is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0428\u0443\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430

R. lives in the city of Vahdat. She is 47 years old, married and has 5 children. She has a high school degree. Shamsiya is a housewife but her main occupation as well as the main source of income for her family is agriculture. She rents a plot of land where she grows wheat and potatoes. After harvest she keeps part of the crops for her family and sells the rest. Currently it is planting season in Tajikistan and Shamsiya requires additional funding to purchase seeds of wheat, potatoes and fertilizer. That is why she has planned to take out this loan. This loan will help her buy quality seeds and harvest a quality harvest which will help her attract new clients and be able to sell all the crops she grows. Shamsiya is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430

L. lives in the city of Vahdat. She is 53 years old, married and has 6 children. She has a High School education. Her business is agriculture. She rents land and plants wheat and potatoes on it. When the crop is ready, she keeps a portion of it for her own family while selling the rest. Burigul has been in this business for about 5 years now. Right now is the planting season. Burigul needs money to purchase potato seeds, wheat seeds and fertilizer. Obtaining a loan will help her purchase high quality seeds, which will in turn result in a high quality crop. This will help her attract new clients and sell the entirety of the crop. Burigul plans to repay the loan in a 12 months period.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\u041b\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430

K. Hakimovich lives in the city of Vahdat. He is 35 years old, is married and has a High School education with professional specialization. He is a turner by profession, however being a turner is more of a side job for him. His main source of income is agriculture. He rents land, plants wheat and potatoes on it and when the crop is ready, keeps a small portion for his own family while selling the rest on the market. Right now is the perfect time for planting. Bahtiyor would like to borrow money in order to purchase high quality seeds, which will in turn result in a high quality crop. The quality of the product will attract additional clients and will help sell the crop with no leftovers. He plans to repay the credit in a 12 months period.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\u041a\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0432

Her turnover, however, is relatively small and does not allow her to increase the variety of goods she has for sale. The profit from the business is just large enough to feed her family. Shahrinisso wishes to see her business grow and generate more and more profit. For this reason she wishes to obtain a loan, which will allow her to diversify her selection of goods up for sale. In addition to that, the loan will allow her neighbors, who are also Shahrinisso's main clients, to purchase more goods  close to home without having to travel to the market.

D. lives in Tursun-zoda, she is 25 years old, is married and has 2 children.  Shahlo has a high school education and is a homemaker.  She does not have a full household because she does not have the resources to purchase domestic animals and you cannot live in a rural area without a cow or at least a few calves especially with little children who need dairy products.<p>\r\n\r\nAs a result, Shahlo has decided to purchase a dairy cow to provide her family with milk and to sell leftover milk to neighbors.  This will allow her to provide her family with milk to drink, dairy products to eat and extra income.  In addition, her neighbors who do not have a cow will be able to purchase milk at affordable prices.  This is her dream and she is applying for a loan to purchase a dairy cow.  Shahlo will pay back the loan over a 15 month period. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

S. lives in Tursun-zoda.  He is 34 years old, is married and has 3 children.  He has a high school education and works at a construction site.  He does not earn very much at his job and supplements his income by raising livestock.  Ravshan has a small barn with several small calves.  He purchases them, grows them, fattens them and then sells them.  He has very little working capital and he needs additional funds. <p>\r\n\r\nRavshan thought about it for a long time, decided that he could get a loan and turned to us.  With the loan he will be able to purchase 2-3 calves, fatten them for around 3 months and resell them for a profit.  By that time demand for animals will increase and prices will go up.  Purchasing calves now, will allow Ravshan to raise the animals without additional costs, because it is now spring and there are no problems with feed (grass).  This will allow Ravshan to maximize his profits and to improve his family\u2019s financial situation.  He has 3 children and would like to give them the opportunity to study and to get an education.  He will pay back the loan over 15 months.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0443\u043b\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432

He is 42 years old, is married and has 4 children.  Olimjon has a high school education and works at a construction site.  He does not earn very much at his job and supplements his income by raising livestock.  Olimjon has a small barn with several small calves.  He purchases them, grows them, fattens them and then sells them.  He has very little working capital and he needs additional funds. <p>\r\n\r\nOlimjon thought about it for a long time, decided that he could get a loan and turned to us.  With the loan he will be able to purchase 2-3 calves, fatten them for around 3 months and resell them for a profit.  By that time demand for animals will increase and prices will go up.  Purchasing calves now, will allow Olimjon to raise the animals without additional costs, because it is now spring and there are no problems with getting grass for feed.  This will allow Olimjon to maximize his profits and to improve his family\u2019s financial situation.  He has 4 children and would like to give them the opportunity to study and to get an education.  He will pay back the loan over 15 months.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0447\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432
