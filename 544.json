Like many other women, five years ago Mairam  lost her job and was left with almost no funds for raising her children. She recalls with horror how she had to buy cheap goods in a market and resell them right away at slightly higher prices, earning very little after each long day of work. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Mairam always had hope for better times. And better times finally came. <p>\r\n\r\nSoon Mairam drew upon her inner resources and started a small business retailing cattle supplies. Her valuable experience helped her create ropes, strings and cords for easier and more convenient handling of cattle. Now, several times a week Mairam goes to the neighboring villages offering her ropes to the residents. Since most are cattle breeders, they find Mairam\u2019s products very useful. Her customers say that Mairam\u2019s hand-made ropes are of a much higher quality than those in the market. <p>\r\n\r\nMairam\u2019s oldest son is now 20 years old and helps the family financially by working in a nearby gas station. Mairam is ambitious to promote new ideas and products. She requests a loan from Kiva  for purchasing personal needs for her children.<p>\r\n\r\n        --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<p>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF) a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She is married and lives with her husband and two children in the village of Kochkorka, an agricultural area with considerable trade. Her other two children already live independently and earn incomes by reselling potatoes. Mairambubu herself used to have a business, which she had to quit because of lack of capital. Now she has opened a small shop by a bus stop. She hopes this strategic location will help her gradually increase her sales. Her products mainly include drinks and snacks, which are often bought by passengers.  Mairambubu\u2019s rent payments are high, so she hopes to attract more customers and achieve more sales through attentive service and lower prices. These humble beginnings will help her secure a good life for her family members. She has already raised enough money to make her children's lives better.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Small loans can make a big difference in the lives of some people. There\u2019s no such thing as too little help. Help from a person on the other side of the planet may seem unrealistic, but Kiva has proved that it\u2019s real. \r\n\r\nAkynai J., 40, is the treasurer of this group. She spent 20 years of her life raising her children and breeding cattle. Cattle is a valuable asset for a typical Kyrgyz family. It is not only a source of income and fresh milk products, but it is also an inheritance of ancestors\u2019 traditions. Akynai inherited cattle from her mother-in-law, and she has not broken this tradition. When cattle have grown enough, she sells them at a stock yard. Usually she is very successful in selling the cattle because she takes good care of her livestock and has a higher demand than her competitors. Akynai\u2019s husband is abroad earning money for their family, while she stays here with their three children. She also works part-time as a janitor in a local hospital. She hopes to get a loan, which she will spend on new furniture for the house. She wants to make her house, and her family's life, more beautiful.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She believes in the saying \u201cHealthy spirit is in a healthy body.\u201d She owns a fitness club, where she teaches ladies of all ages how to stay fit. The idea of opening this club was her husband's. He is also an experienced businessman. While on maternity leave, she wrote a business plan for a fitness club. Fortunately, her funds managed to cover all of the expenses, including attracting customers, advertising, and equipment. The income from the business was used to purchase a small piece of land where Kanyshai would like to build a shop. She requests a loan to purchase equipment for running. It is the only thing she lacks in the fitness club.

Life became complicated for Akjol two years ago when his mother, who initially used to run this business, fell ill with a strong disease. Her disease requires constant treatment and bed rest, so Akjol, being the only male in the family, took upon himself the responsibility for the financial stability of the family. \r\n\r\nTwo years in business helped Akjol to learn gradually the best ways of increasing his sales. He orients on customers\u2019 shifts in taste, price of the products and quality. The derived profit is spent on the basic needs of the family and payment for his tuition. The initial start-up capital was 20,000 soms; now it yields him 10,000 soms per month. Akjol is in hopes of getting the loan, because he would spend it on medical treatment for his mother.

Her business made its first steps in 2007, when she just gave birth to her daughter and was trying to figure out how she could make money while staying at home with two kids. Aigul was inspired by her baby girl, for whom she used to knit woolen socks and sweaters. Sitting for long hours in the evenings, she came up with an idea. What if she tried to sell these items? Aigul thought of potential customers and started offering them her goods. Her husband, who works as a driver in a cement producing plant, was amused by his wife\u2019s talent and creativity. Now her production has moved into bigger items. Three years of creativity and hard work have brought brilliant results. The family could afford to build a brand new house with two bedrooms. The revenue is spent partially on family needs and savings, and some of it is invested back in the business. Aigul requests a loan from Kiva to buy materials for sewing <i>tushaks<\/i>, special Kyrgyz blankets which are ordered as a dowry for brides. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young and ambitious socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 <i>People<\/i> (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), <i>Planet<\/i> (keeping environmentally friendly) and <i>Profit<\/i> (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The lack of a formal education doesn\u2019t stop our entrepreneurs from getting engaged in business. They believe their skills and life experience are far more relevant than formal education. \r\n\r\nAkbala N., 48, is a member of this group. He\u2019s a resident of the town of Kadamjai in southern Kyrgyzstan. He is divorced and doesn\u2019t have any kids. Akbala operates a repair shop fixing vehicles. He likes his work and is keen to improve it. He wants to start a new life though his perseverance and ambition. Akbala is an eager beaver and strives for a better standard of living. He also helps his aged mother financially. Machinery has always been Akbala\u2019s strong passion. There were times when he dreamed of getting a technological education and opening his own car producing business. But unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have any opportunities for getting an education. He\u2019s been in this business for just two years and already he's become famous among customers and has waiting lists of them. He\u2019s earning 5000 soms a month, but he says his plans for the business will take more than that. Akbala plans to buy spare parts for cars to improve the quality and speed of his services. He says every model of a car needs a unique part and a special approach. \r\n\r\nWhere Did This Loan Come From?\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Theresa is married and lives in San Remegio, Cebu. She earns a living by fishing and fish vending.  Her husband Dionisio, 55, is also a fisherman, who works hard to increase their income and develop their businesses.  They have nine children in the ages between 5 and 35 years. Ma. Theresa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the last four loans taken from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Theresa has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000,  uplifting her family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 that she intends to use for buying fishing nets which should boost her fish vending business. She wants to continue saving up for her children's education in the future. Ma. Teresa is a Dungganon woman who is working hard to fulfill her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

L. is a 32-year old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  sari-sari (general) store and a bakery. She lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. Through these two businesses, she is gradually making her family economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 10,000. \r\n\r\nMarites is borrowing PHP 11,000 to fund operations of her business venture. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marites aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is a diligent person, who started his own cattle breeding business when he was younger, in 1990. \n\nMiralakbar requested a loan of 2,000 AZN from AqroInvest and Kiva. This is his second loan taken from Aqroinvest. Miralakbar has a good client history from repaying his prior loan. With this second loan he bought four more cows to increase his earnings. \n\nMiralakbar wants to breed more animals and raise his profits, and in this way support a better life for his dear son.

Twelve years ago, Martha and her husband started a business together after he lost his job.  They both applied for unemployment benefits, and as a result, were able to establish the merchandise business that they have today.  This enables them to continue maintaining their home since it is their only source of income.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter analyzing the experience of a friend who sells cosmetics through catalogs, Martha decided to invest in this type of business and looked for sources of capital so that she and her husband could continue to work.  Her family was able to support itself for some time when her husband made the decision to work independently.  He continues to help strengthen her business every day.  When she needed additional capital to fulfill the many requests she received from her customers, Martha decided to organize a solidarity group in order to access a loan, which was the beginning of her relationship with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She has been with FMSD for over seven years.  Martha was part of a solidarity group for three years and has now been working as an individual for three years.  Up to this point, she has received sixteen loans that have helped to capitalize her business and generate enough revenue to maintain her home and invest in the education of her daughters who are currently studying for their university degrees.  Her goal at the moment is to remodel the location of her business so that her customers will be more comfortable.  In the future, Martha hopes to lead a sales force that will maintain her business and likewise support her family.  This Kiva loan is her seventeenth, and will be used to buy clothes, perfumes, and cosmetics to slightly increase her capital.  She hopes to continue attracting new customers.

C. is a young, single woman who owns a business selling specialized goods including cosmetics, accessories, perfumes, clothing, and footwear. She has a small store where her products are displayed in an elegant and well-ordered manner allowing her clients to find something to catch their attention and purchase. Edith started this business to pay for college. Her business went so well that she continues to run it, with the understanding that she will have to work to expand and strengthen her shop.\r\n\r\nEdith recently opened her first line of credit with Kiva, although this is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She delivers all types of merchandise on a motorbike to her customers who live in the different neighborhoods of the city of Cartagena, her primary market.

These are women who work hard to get ahead without letting the obstacles in their path stop them.  One of these women is Mar\u00eda Elena, the president of the group.  She is 46 years old, single and has one minor child.  She works every day with commitment and dedication to her profession as a seamstress, her source of income.  She started a small shop in her house because she didn't have anyone to care for her young son.  Her business grows more each day.  \n\nShe will use the current loan to purchase fabric to make school uniforms.

is a married woman who lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a transportation (tricycle) business. Her husband Vicente, who is 63 years old, drives the tricycle to help his wife in earning a living for their family. They have three children who are 15 to 24 years old. Marina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 12000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to pay the annual registration of their existing tricycle and buy a new tricycle so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and house repairs. Marina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing and ready-to-wear clothing businesses. Jije Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jije Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14000, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to purchase more fishing nets and ready-to-wear inventory so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and house repair. Jije Grace is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Rosa used to work at a clothing store but used her savings and help from her husband to gradually set up her business buying the basic things housewives need like sacks of rice and sugar and cases of milk.  She started selling like this and started to stand out with much effort and dedication.  She\u2019s currently in the same business, is very well known and liked by her customers who come by daily to buy; she stocks everything a housewife needs.\r\n\r\nShe will use this 2000 new sol loan to buy sacks of rice and sugar, cookies of all flavors, several varieties of snacks, different brands of shampoo, carbonated soft drinks in various sizes and brands and personal hygiene products to continue to provide better service to her customers.\r\n\r\nRosita, as she is affectionately called, feels like a woman fulfilled, with more desire to get ahead always.  She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her start her little business as well as other women who need help too.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":711558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"She will buy groceries to increase stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-02-17T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:05:41Z","rounded_local_amount":334.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195880570,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":334.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201321864,"comment":null},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":334.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206190361,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":334.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211263814,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":334.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216543616,"comment":null},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":334.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221712133,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-22T00:26:52Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":272823,"name":"Ma.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: Sari-sari (general)store, rice retailer and sugar cane businesses. Her husband Ramonito, who is 57 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 27 to 32 years old. Natividad joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Natividad has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 8000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her Sari-sari Store so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and improve her family's living conditions. Natividad is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

D. is from Sabirabad. He is a 40-year-old man living with his family. Salim grew up in a family of farmers. He got married when he was very young and soon became the father of two sons and one daughter. In order to provide a better life for his family, Salim started his business of cattle breeding. He has been practicing cattle breeding for ten years. \r\n\r\nNow he earns about 400 AZN a month selling dairy and meat products in the local bazaar. This business is his main source of income.

is a married woman who lives in Barangay Tan-awan, in Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  fish vending and pig fattening. Her husband, Francisco, who is 60 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 22 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nJuliana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juliana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $187, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use for additional capital for the fish vending business so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Juliana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Prum Y. is a widow with two children, one of whom is a driver who earns a low salary, while the other is a farmer.

She intends to use it to buy materials for the sewing machine so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and the improvement of her home & store. Enrequita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is a 42-year-old married woman who supports her family by fishing. She lives in Daan Bantayan, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fishing business, Rosita is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. \r\n\r\nRosita is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment.  This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nRosita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 36 years old. Jane is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Jane O.'s group.\r\n\r\nJane is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Jane owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jane has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 3,200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jane joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jane has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jane is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Jane from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

is a married woman who lives in Madridejos, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:  pig fattening, fishing and fish selling businesses. Her husband Pepi, who is 31 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 7 months to 12 years old.\r\n\r\nMaricel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maricel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 35,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy feed, medicine and vaccines for the pigs, and repair the fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for future education and expansion of business. Maricel is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She is 40 years old and has lived with her family in a 3 room brick house in the area of Yadgar for the past 26 years. She is married to S. M., who is a blacksmith and makes iron boxes on order. The iron boxes are used to keep clothes, quilts and blankets in houses. He has been doing this business for the past 5 years and has a good number of clients in his area who give him regular orders due to his ability to make quality boxes at cheap rates. \r\n\r\nRani is a caring lady, who prefers to stay at home and manage the household chores. She has a very good nature and loves keeping flowers at home. She enjoys taking care of them. She is the mother of 2 sons. Her eldest son is a tailor by profession while the second one is studying in class 9. \r\n\r\nRani has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the improvement of her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy iron to make more iron boxes for selling. Rani is hopeful that the loan investment will help her husband to improve his business and also for her family to enjoy a better life. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 4th loan application. In previous loan years, she has maintained a good credit behavior and never missed any meetings.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":712302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

is a married woman who lives in Madridejos, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  general store and pig fattening. Her husband Francisco, who is 36 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 8 and 10 years old, and currently going to school.\r\n\r\nSheila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sheila has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 49,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 49,500, which she intends to use to buy more stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future education and home renovation costs. Sheila is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest
