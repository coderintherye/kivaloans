While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLilibeth is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Lilibeth owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Lilibeth has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lilibeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilibeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Lilibeth is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Lilibeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

His start as an entrepreneur was successful due to his great efforts and strong will to provide his children with the essentials. \r\n\r\nErkul was able to open his own small shop and purchase tracks for products transportation. In June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the Osh city, Erkul lost his business. His sales shop at the market was robbed and looted, and his storage was burned. But Erkul didn\u2019t give up and decided to resume his lost business and continue his activities. For this very reason, Erkul is applying for a loan of 100,000 soms (KGS), which he needs to restart his business.

Mildred is requesting a new loan of 18000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Mildred from ASKI.

She is married with 3 children aged 16 to 23 years old.  She started this activity because her husband became unemployed.  Her mother gave her the money to start, and she also had the entrepreneurial idea.  It gives her satisfaction today and is in growth mode. \r\n\r\nShe began in the corner of her home with her own kitchen utensils and those of her mother.

Married to Seidou, a computer specialist, Edwige is the mother of three children, some of whom are in school. About a dozen years ago, Edwige settled in the Dadji district in Cotonou. The spouses jointly take care of the family needs. Edwige stopped her studies at the high school level.

She says that she buys her merchandise from an authorized dealer in Zitacuaro because she pays less there and can earn more when she resells the merchandise.  She likes the business very much because it allows her to keep an eye on her children.  Sra. Ivet is married to Sr. Enrique who sells seasonal flowers.  They have two children: Daniela, 5, who is in kindergarten and a 4-month old baby named Jose Pablo.  Sra. Ivet's goal is to continue investing in her business.  She wants to buy a copier in the future because there are none nearby and sell other paper and office products.  She says that she plans to buy her young children Christmas gifts with part of the earnings from her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":666446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy products to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ZITACUARO, ESTADO DE MICHOAC\u00c1N","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-18T14:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iveth Azucena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140.67,"local_amount":1688,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1745.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691543,"comment":null},{"amount":187.46,"local_amount":2249.5,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430743,"comment":null},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850004,"comment":null},{"amount":234.37,"local_amount":2812.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292277,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T17:59:58Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":259180,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria del Carmen M.

Ruiz lives in a town called San Jose Purua in the Mexican state of Michoacan. It's a beautiful place known for its hot springs and sulfur baths. Dona Carmen, 35, left school in the sixth grade when she moved to the city of Mexicali in Baja California Norte, where she lived for 10 years.  She says that she never returned to school because she wasn't a good student and preferred working.  In Mexicali, she worked as a day laborer doing casual work.  Dona Carmen is applying for a loan to buy underwear for women and children that she will sell at local markets on weekends.  She has operated the business for about a year and a half.  She sells underwear during the week, as well, and operates a business clearing fields of prickly pear.  She says that it's a hard life, but she has to work hard to support herself because everything is so expensive.  She also wants to save to build a new house, one of brick, not wood like the one where she lives now.  Dona Carmen is married to Sr. Miguel, a day laborer, and they have 3 children, none of whom live at home.  Ismael, 14, has left school and works with her mother as a day laborer and Maria Isabel, 12, is in school.

Guille, as she is known in her community, studied until her third year of primary school because her parents didn't have enough money to pay her school costs.  She says that her daughter, who is in high school, is teaching her to read and write so that she can study for a primary school certificate and improve herself.  \r\n\r\nGuille is asking for this loan to invest in her business that sells underwear, bathroom slippers, socks, earrings, hair bands, and women's accessories and makeup.  She used to sell fruits and vegetables but she didn't like that type of business because if all of the fruit is not sold, it will go bad and she would lose money.  For that reason, now she sells products that earn more money and don't go bad.  She buys some of her merchandise in M\u00e9xico and other parts in Zitacuaro Michoac\u00e1n.  She has had this business for two years, and she sells products at the flea market in her area and in the towns close to her.  She also works as a maid because she has to help her children and grandchildren get ahead.\r\n\r\nGuillermina is a single mother with nine children, but only four live with her.  Gerardo is 18 years old and stopped going to school after 6th grade, so he doesn't have a plan for the future and can't improve himself.  Yuriccia, 16, and Edwin, 14, are high school students.  Alfonso is 12 and is in primary school.  She also cares for three of her grandchildren.  Three months ago, their father died from a brain tumor and their mother had to emigrate to the United States to work.  She sends money for their expenses.  \r\n\r\nGuillermina's goal for her business is to purchase a fixed location since she currently lays out her articles on the floor.  She is very happy because thanks to her loan, her business is slowly growing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":666431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase women's, men's and children's underwear, socks and accessories\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ZITACUARO, ESTADO DE MICHOAC\u00c1N","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-18T14:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":18.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":233.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691545,"comment":null},{"amount":24.95,"local_amount":249.5,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":309.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430745,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":310.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850006,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":312.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":387.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292279,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T16:38:36Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":259183,"name":"Georgina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Georgina T.

With that income she will also make punctual repayments to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\nHer biggest dream is to expand her bakery over time, since she has nobody to support her except God's blessing and her own hard work to move her forward.\r\nShe formed the group but had a break for one cycle and is now back in the programme. The group is called \"Nueva Organizaci\u00f3n\" (New Organisation), as it is a new group made up of new people who have also been in the programme.\r\n      The group's members are:\r\n*Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez Garc\u00eda: is investing the loan in buying goods to stock his grocery shop, and also in the purchase and sale of pepper.\r\n*Rafaelita S\u00e1nchez Garc\u00eda: will invest the loan in the purchase of ingredients for baking bread.\r\n*Cirila S\u00e1nchez M.: is investing the loan in the purchase and sale of agricultural products.\r\n*Vivian Ibis S.

Jos\u00e9's main plans are to continue supporting his children so that they can continue preparing themselves professionally.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has his own business which is an auto repair shop.  His business has been going for 26 years.  He has maintained it and has plans to grow it.  During the time that he has had his business, he has faced a number of problems, such as his children's health, which have prevented him from putting his plans into practice.  He started his business with the help of his family and his knowledge of running the business.  His short term plans are to increase his income over the first few months of the year and, in the long term, he plans to expand the number of machines he has so that he has more variety.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is grateful to Afodenic for the support that they are giving him in this loan cycle since, thanks to the Institution, he has managed to gradually improve his standard of living.

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti. Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activity here is the Free trading zone, a cement factory, and others. This is an area where crime is rampant and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. Angela makes her home here in a simple structure with her three children.\r\n\r\nAngela is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza. She has a food stand where she sells breakfast and lunch. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing meat, rice, beans, vegetables, oil, etc. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business.

By starting her own small business, \u2018A Coach for Success,\u2019 Kumari has found a way to turn that passion into a career. \r\n\r\nKumari has been coaching individuals for over 30 years. Her unique coaching style, now embodied in A Coach for Success, draws on Kumari\u2019s education in Holistic Heath Education, experiences working with social service agencies, and lessons from her own process of self-discovery. A Coach for Success has been Kumari\u2019s side project while working a full-time job with a nonprofit organization in Richmond, CA, but she is now ready to take the plunge and invest herself fulltime in her business. \r\n\r\nKumari currently coaches 20 clients, teaches workshops in the community, and speaks at events. Being her own boss \u2013 with full control of her own schedule \u2013 will allow her to be a more effective coach, as well as reach out to more individuals. She has found over the past few years that her workshop and coaching style are particularly timely. Perhaps due to the economic recession, Kumari explains that, \u201cPeople feel like they need to look at their life right now. I ask them: What do you want? Why? What\u2019s stopping you?\u201d \r\n\r\nEven so, Kumari explains that marketing is the most challenging part of owning her own business; \u201cTransformation isn\u2019t often something that people want to go through.\u201d To help promote her business she needs products \u2013 such as stories, greeting cards, tapes, and more workbooks- to accompany her workshops and speaking engagements. With a $2,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, Kumari will be able to develop these products, increase other advertising efforts, and at last take her business to the next level. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about A Coach for Success, visit: http:\/\/acoachforsuccess.com   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":668861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To develop products such as cards, tapes, and workbooks to accompany her workshops; other advertising costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Oakland, California","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2010-12-20T20:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":149.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":162.41},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168.26},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":169.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":171.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":172.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":173.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.41},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.26},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.61},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":149.45,"local_amount":149.45,"processed_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":149.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474295,"comment":null},{"amount":162.41,"local_amount":162.41,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":162.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900108,"comment":null},{"amount":164.64,"local_amount":164.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":164.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201339477,"comment":null},{"amount":164.64,"local_amount":164.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":164.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209507,"comment":null},{"amount":166.07,"local_amount":166.07,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":166.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284820,"comment":null},{"amount":166.9,"local_amount":166.9,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-25T08:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":166.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381932,"comment":null},{"amount":1025.89,"local_amount":1025.89,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854377,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-22T11:21:20Z","paid_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":259322,"name":"Los Heraldos De Motupe Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"HERALDOS D.

In the future, Tara plans to raise the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70 percent of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She is married and has two children, ages 35 and 30. In 2004, she established her grocery store. Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy grocery goods for her shop. In the future, Krishna Maiya plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a <i>pasal<\/i>, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical <i>pasal<\/i> might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Mercedita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as convenience foods and canned goods. This loan will be her third from HSPFI.

Merlyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as instant noodles and convenience foods. This loan will be her third from HSPFI.

Sulfecia has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2010, Sulfecia joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Sulfecia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as snack foods and beverages. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

P., age 33, owns and oeprates a sari-sari (variety) shop, offering such daily-use products as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, and snack foods for sale in her local community. Emelyn has been engaged in her business for over five years and it brings her approximately 7,000 PHP a month. She and her husband live in the village of Malinao, Gingoog City. \r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Emelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Emelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and was employed as working capital. Emelyn is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase snack foods, biscuits, and other additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Emelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 53 years old. Anita is widowed and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Anita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods and beverages in the local community. Anita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Anita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Anita is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional products to sell like snack foods and canned goods. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Anita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Elsie Jean has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. Elsie Jean is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase hair solutions and other products needed. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Elsie Jean from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for Mayita's husband's business.  He sells fruits and vegetables across the whole city and also visits areas surrounding the city.  Every morning he takes his motorcycle to the city's market to buy products wholesale.  He then goes out through the streets and other areas with his products.  Mayita says that her husband works hard during the days so that they do not lack anything.\r\n\r\nMayita is requesting this loan to help her husband with his business.  He will buy fruits and vegetables with it.  Mayita has been in the communal bank for six cycles and she likes it because it allows her to contribute in some way to her family's expenses.  Her dream is to have a grocery store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":669834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayita Marianela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422653,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841419,"comment":null},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283801,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151712,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-02T05:37:30Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:59:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":259448,"name":"Nelly Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En Los Bajos de Montecristi, ciudad conocida por su gran diversidad de productos t\u00edpicos, como por ejemplo los sombreros de paja toquillas conocidos dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds se re\u00fanen cada 15  d\u00edas las socias del Banco Comunal Santa Martha.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Nelly  es socia fundadora del Banco comunal y le gusta por la ayuda que brinda la instituci\u00f3n y por las facilidades para los cr\u00e9ditos.

For some time, she sold juice in the center of the city, but because this business was far, her children stayed by themselves a lot. As a result, she and her husband decided to start a general store in their house. Recently, her business was growing, and she mostly sold seasonal fruit and sweets, including cookies, sponge cakes, chocolates, and sodas. Her business does best during the school year because her store is near a high school. With her business, she has been able to help her daughter so that she can continue studying computers and informatics.

Her oldest son helps her in her business, her middle daughter attends university, and her youngest son studies painting at the vocational training center. \r\n\r\nUranchimeg operates a retail meat business out of a rented stall at the local market in her town. She started her business in 2010 with working capital of 100,000 MNT. After several months of hard work and a loyal customer base, her working capital now exceeds 500,000 MNT. She would like to expand her business in the near future and further increase her product line. Since operating her business, she is able to provide for her family. \r\n\r\nUranchimeg is a helpful and hard-working person who says, \"I work hard to buy my own house and fence for my family.\" She is requesting a 500,000 MNT loan to purchase and preserve more meat in order to increase her working capital.\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n[Editor's note: For information about the role of fences in
