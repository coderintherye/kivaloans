He makes his home there in a simple structure with his long-term partner and their children.\r\n\r\nJuan is excited to be taking his sixth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loans and grown his business.

She lives in the development of La Playa, which is near the sea where many residents go to fish.  Daly Flor primarily sells cold cuts and sausages made of chicken and pork.  She also sells soft drinks.  This is her sixth loan and she wants to buy a large volume of processed meats and cases of soft drinks.  She experiences high turnover on the weekends, so she goes through her inventory very quickly.  Like many businesses near her, she needs to attract new customers to continue making sales.  Daly Flor started her business nine years ago when she began selling processed meats by taking orders.  Through her business, she got to know many people and began selling gold jewelry with them for a period of two years.  When the price of gold went up and no longer generated profitable returns, she returned to selling processed meats with greater enthusiasm.  From that moment, she joined a solidarity group with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has managed to repay her loans promptly.  \r\n<p>\r\nDaly Flor is an esteemed woman who has succeeded in raising her children and running her business.  She has never lacked anything because she invested her loans in her business and generated good earnings to cover her expenses and support her family.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to move to a different residence because she is affected by heavy rains during the wet season.  Another goal she has is to acquire a cooler so that she can store more processed meats and increase her inventory.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

This area is located 45 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nNicolas has been buying and selling rice for a year.  He purchases sacks of rice from the mills in the city of Chiclayo and then sells them to grocery stores and businesses in the city of Cajamarca.  This type of business is very profitable in Cajamarca because it is located in a mountainous area of the country where everyday consumer products are not readily available.  At the moment, this business is his only source of income, so Nicolas invests all of his efforts into maintaining it.\r\n<p>\r\nNicolas has become well-known in the area and more people are requesting his product.  For this reason, he wants to buy more sacks of rice so that he can increase his sales.  To meet this goal, Nicolas is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1500 PEN.\r\n<p>\r\nNicolas is a father who is dedicated to his work and his family.

C. is from the town of Banga. He is 60 years old. Manuel is married and has 7 adult children. To make a living, Manuel owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.

C. is from the town of Banga. She is 35 years old. Mary is married and has 2 infant children. To make a living, Mary owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Mary has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nMary joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary has successfully repaid a previous loan  from CEVI. Mary is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the third loan taken out by Mary from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

D. is from the town of Banga. He is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Norberto grows crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Norberto has been engaged in his business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nNorberto joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Norberto is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Norberto from CEVI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement his family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

B. is from the village of Christine, District 1, Cauayan City, Isabela.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Yolanda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be Yolanda's fourth loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs. \r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. is from the town of Banga. She is 38 years old. Othelia is married and has 3 school-age children. To make a living, Othelia owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Othelia has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nOthelia joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Othelia is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure and other farming materials. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Othelia from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She was into a coffee-selling business before she ventured into her current enterprise.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Yeko wants to revamp and expand her business through the purchase of more bags of bananas and passion fruit that she will later sell to her increasing clientele.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":547500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more bags of bananas and passion fruit to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-30T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yeko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perusi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5200000,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":325000},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":325000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":708.67,"local_amount":1619813,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1622634.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662507,"comment":null},{"amount":682.96,"local_amount":1561050,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1563769.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689285,"comment":null},{"amount":533.14,"local_amount":1218600,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1220722.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903441,"comment":null},{"amount":350.23,"local_amount":800537,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":801931.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296918,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-31T08:11:15Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204718,"name":"Sharlet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharlet is a mother of five, four girls and one boy.

She sells cosmetics. She's done this for more than 3 years. Before starting her business she didn't have work, but with some savings she decided to set up in a commercial center, where she offers various products from catalogs. That's how she started making a living. She's been making countless sales visits to everyone she knows, and even though the trips are long she maintains hope that this work will improve her situation. The loan will be for the purchase of creams, colognes, beauty treatments, underwear, and other things.

ofrece vestidos para ni\u00f1as y accesorios a la medida y al gusto de sus clientes; su negocio consiste en comprar telas  e insumos de modister\u00eda para mandarle a fabricar a 3 confeccionistas, los mas fant\u00e1sticos vestidos, combinados con accesorios arm\u00f3nicos y adornos como sombreros cintillos, binchas adornadas, para ni\u00f1as que participan como ninfas, damas de honor en matrimonios, o en cumplea\u00f1os, bautizos y ocasiones elegantes y especiales de las familias. Mediante este sistema Aura  suministra a cr\u00e9dito y a muy buen precio sus productos, porque para ella es  muy  claro que con su calidad en los precios ella compite. Sus clientes   son  almacenes en los centro de Barranquilla y en muchas ciudades y municipios de la costa caribe como Bosconia, en el Departamento del Cesar,  Cienaga en el Departamento del Magdalena y Monter\u00eda en el Departamento de C\u00f3rdoba,  donde viaja semanalmente llevando sus productos  junto a su libreta de cuentas por cobrar para recuperar su dinero.\n\nElla trabaja en horario extendido y ha progresado mucho desde su primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo hasta la presente, sus ventas se han incrementado en un 50% y as\u00ed mismo sus ingresos y utilidades. Hoy est\u00e1 solicitando su tercer financiamiento y desea prepararse para la temporada alta del segundo semestre del a\u00f1o, comprando materias primas al  por mayor y de contado e insumos como telas y adornos para poder mandar a elaborar los dise\u00f1os mas apetecidos.\nSu meta y gran desaf\u00edo es hacer de sus hijos unos profesionales, ya que la mayor se grad\u00faa este a\u00f1o como bachiller y el menor terminar\u00e1 su nivel de primaria, por lo que tiene que  seguir realizando muchos esfuerzos  desde su populoso barrio ubicado en el sur de Barranquilla muy cerca de centros comerciales y del famoso estadio donde juega el equipo de futbol que mas quiere la ciudad: \u201cEl Junior de Barranquilla\u201d\n","en":"If you knew Se\u00f1ora Aura O., you\u2019d know that she personifies \u201csaleswoman.\u201d  Even though she doesn\u2019t have machines, she sells little girls\u2019 dresses and accessories to the size and preference of her customers.  Her business is buying material and dressmaking supplies to send out to three seamstresses.  The most fantastic dresses combined with the right accessories and adornments like headbands for hats and decorated binchas for girls who participate as nymphs, bridesmaids, or in birthdays, baptisms, elegant occasions, and special family events.\r\n\r\nThrough this system Aura sells her products on credit, and at a good price, because it is very clear to her that quality and price compete.  Her customers are stores in Barranquilla and in many cities and municipalities of the Caribbean coast like Bosconia in the Department of Cesar, Cienaga in the Department of Magdalena, and Monter\u00eda in the Department of C\u00f3rdoba where she travels weekly bringing her products alongside her accounting book to collect her money.  \r\n\r\nShe works extended hours and has progressed a lot since her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to the present.  Her sales have increased by 50% as well as her earnings and profits. Today she is taking out her third loan and wants to get ready for the high season (the second semester of the year) by buying wholesale raw materials and supplies like fabrics and decorations, paying in full, to be able to send out to have the best designs made.\r\n\r\nHer goal, and great challenge, is to make her children professionals since the oldest graduates from high school this year and the youngest finishes grade school.  She has to keep going as much as possible from her populous neighborhood, south of Barranquilla, very close to malls and the famous stadium where the city\u2019s most beloved team \u201cEl Junior de Barranquilla\u201d plays.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":547441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Wholesale raw materials and supplies -- paid in full (fabrics, accessories, decorations)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-28T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aura Sofia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83429},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88861},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90564},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92300},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94069},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":95872},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97710},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":99582},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101491},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":103436},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":105419},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107439},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":109499},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111597},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118732}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.53},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.43},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.1,"local_amount":83429,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":84809.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895882,"comment":null},{"amount":92.7,"local_amount":179425,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":182392.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850305,"comment":null},{"amount":47.7,"local_amount":92300,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":93826.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410931,"comment":null},{"amount":48.6,"local_amount":94069,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":95625.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550590,"comment":null},{"amount":49.53,"local_amount":95872,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97457.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688191,"comment":null},{"amount":318.13,"local_amount":615730,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":625915.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427427,"comment":null},{"amount":175.24,"local_amount":339175,"processed_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":344785.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000842,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-30T20:49:11Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204782,"name":"Oscar Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Oscar Antonio tiene el negocio que es una pulper\u00eda ubicada en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n,  realiza sus compras de contado a camiones repartidores, sus ventas las efect\u00faa de contado y al cr\u00e9dito.

Occasionally she also buys fish and sells it in her house to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nSara tells us that these activities have been useful to her in order to get ahead.  Now her family has their own home.  Also, she feels that the work she does in the rural areas helps the villagers to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe wants to work a little more to be able to get a greater income because her youngest child will be registering for school very soon.  That is why she has asked, for the first time, Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 800 PEN.  She will use it to buy poultry to expand her business of selling poultry.\r\n\r\nSara is a happy woman, and she always works thinking of her family\u2019s well-being.   Her greatest desire is to improve the infrastructure of her house because it is still maD. of adobe.  In the area where she lives she is loved and respected by her neighbors. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":547776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy poultry to expand her business of raising them and selling them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-05-28T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":71.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":73.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":75.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":84.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":86.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":89.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":91.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.73},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.71,"local_amount":68.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":73.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695238,"comment":null},{"amount":26.86,"local_amount":71.63,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":77.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878298,"comment":null},{"amount":27.73,"local_amount":73.95,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":79.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618329,"comment":null},{"amount":28.15,"local_amount":75.06,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":80.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832725,"comment":null},{"amount":29.53,"local_amount":78.75,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099331,"comment":null},{"amount":29.96,"local_amount":79.89,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":86.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555296,"comment":null},{"amount":64.25,"local_amount":171.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":184.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666287,"comment":null},{"amount":33.38,"local_amount":89.01,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":95.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409615,"comment":null},{"amount":34.43,"local_amount":91.82,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":98.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108059,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-29T00:44:42Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204794,"name":"Emprendiendo Sin Fronteras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LA SRA.

Yinaira es una vendedora de v\u00edveres, artesianas, y almuerzos. Es tradicional en este sector que las personas consuman sopa a la hora del almuerzo, por lo que es com\u00fan ver varios negocios similares, pero a su microempresa la prefieren. Su negocio fue iniciado por su madre hace 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de haber tenido en el mercado de Barraquilla un puesto de mayorista de verduras. Se inicio con una tienda, que ahora tiene arrendada y despu\u00e9s mont\u00f3 una miscel\u00e1nea, pero esta \u00faltima no tuvo mucho \u00e9xito por la competencia y debi\u00f3 cerrarla, lo cual fu\u00e9 uno de sus desaf\u00edos mas dif\u00edciles. En el ano 2005 en vista de la demanda de almuerzos y sopas en el sector decidi\u00f3 iniciar  este negocio para vender a sus vecinos y a varios establecimientos comerciales cercanos a su vivienda. Es precisamente para fortalecer este negocio que requiere el cr\u00e9dito, ya que debe ampliar el local y adquirir nuevos sillas e implementos para cocina como ollas, platos y cubiertos. Adem\u00e1s obtiene otros ingresos por tejidos que elabora de prendas de resistir y bolsos los cuales env\u00eda a Medell\u00edn, una ciudad importante de Colombia, para su comercializaci\u00f3n.

Desde que comenz\u00f3 con FMSD, logr\u00f3 incrementar su nivel de ventas y mejorar sus ingresos y esto es mejorar su nivel de vida e irse haciendo a electrodom\u00e9sticos para su uso.. Siguiendo hacia delante, ella espera organizar el punto de venta de almuerzos con el fin de incrementar sus ingresos. \n\n\n","en":"Yinaira Paola Guti\u00e9rrez Quiroz is a young woman who lives with her spouse and one-year-old son in  Malambo\u2019s  Bellavista neighborhood near Barranquilla.  She sells food, crafs and lunches. \r\n\r\nIn this area it is traditional to eat soups for lunch so it is quite commonplace to see several similar businesses but her micro business is the prefered one.  Her mother began it 20 years ago after having had a wholesale vegetable stand in Barranquilla\u2019s market.  She started out with a store which she now leases out and then set up a general store.  However, this latter project wasn\u2019t very successful due to high competition so it had to be closed; this was one of her most difficult challenges.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 the high demand for lunches and soups in the sector led to her opening this business in order to sell to her neighbors and to established commercial businesses near her home.  It is precisely to strengthen this business that she needs funds because she needs to enlarge it and acquire new chairs and kitchen utensils like pots, dishes and cutlery.  (She earns additional income selling woven articles of clothing and purses she makes; she sends them to Medell\u00edn, an important city in Colombia, to be sold there).  She needs to make improvements to her site; it needs a roof over the entrance so that her food business will be more visible and fresh.\r\n\r\nThis will be the 2nd loan she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Since associating herself with FMSD she managed to increase her sales and improve her earnings which means improved living conditions; she has been able to acquire home appliances for her use.  Continuing forward, she hopes to organize her lunch point of sale in order to increase her income.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

The group is comprised of 10 members and it is the first time that they have requested a loan from credicomun.  Mrs. \u00c1ngela Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Hern\u00e1ndez is a member of this group; she is 31 years old and studied until the 6th grade.  She is married and has two sons- ages 8 and 7.  She breeds and fattens sheep, which began 8 years ago with a single lamb, which fattened and sold.  With this money, she bought a lamb for the reproduction of the species and that\u2019s how their business began.  She is requesting the loan to buy food and fodder to feed their sheep. When she sells them, she will be able to acquire others and again invest in the growth of the lamb from the sheep.  Also, she has other animals such as chickens, turkeys, and rabbits.\r\n\r\nShe is excited about her loan application, because she has had other loans, which have benefited her greatly.  She has been able to invest in growing food for her animals and to consume in her home. She has also been able to invest in school supplies and clothing for her children. She is convinced that while business thrives she will continue working to provide greater opportunity for her childrens\u2019 education. She will also be able to improve their quality of life by bringing in goods for the home and services such as water and electricity since she does not currently have them.  Also, she hopes in time to increase the size of her rabbit-raising business because she believes that this business also generates good profits and maybe later can get larger orders, butchered or alive. Then, the business will grow generating the best income possible for her and her family. Areli C. D\u00edaz is the president of the group.  She is 22 years old and studied until her third year of high school.  She is a housewife with no children. She started fattening pigs a year ago and is requesting a loan to buy the food and fodder for these animals. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include:\r\n-Paulina T. D.

She began to look for a way to realize her dream of having a professional career that would enable her to get a good job and help her family financially.  That was when she learned about being a beautician and she began doing haircuts, hair styling, hair relaxing, pedicures, and manicures.  With the help of a neighbor who left her women\u2019s clothes on consignment on easy terms, she began to sell, and the next year went out on her own because she was doing well.  She put in some of her own capital and began to travel to Barranquilla where she brought women\u2019s clothing.  Later on her current partner joined the business and increased her micro entrepreneurial experience.  They diversified what she was selling with a new line of products in catalogs such as perfumes and cosmetics.  She didn\u2019t stop working as a beautician since she had all the equipment and knowledge in the field and also her customers were asking for her services.  Currently the family income comes from her businesses and she succeeded in completing her high school and wants to finish more studies related to her work. She is now asking for her first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to buy supplies for her beauty business and merchandise, mainly purses, shoes and women\u2019s clothing.\r\nIn the future she dreams of having her own house, planning for the stability of the children she wants to have, and she also wants to help people get their own capital, as she was.  She lives in an area that is a mixture of families and big businesses.  That is an industrial zone of Cartagena and this helps her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":547788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Beauty supplies and principally merchandise such as purses, shoes, and women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-29T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":128977},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":151108},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":154256},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":157470},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160751},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":164100},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":167518},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":171008},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":174571},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":178208},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":181921},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":210112}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.44},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.7},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.39},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.85},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.1,"local_amount":128977,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":130218.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636212,"comment":null},{"amount":77.44,"local_amount":151108,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":152562.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850309,"comment":null},{"amount":159.76,"local_amount":311726,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":314726.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410935,"comment":null},{"amount":82.38,"local_amount":160751,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":162298.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688195,"comment":null},{"amount":84.1,"local_amount":164100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":165679.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427430,"comment":null},{"amount":173.5,"local_amount":338526,"processed_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":341784.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000846,"comment":null},{"amount":180.8,"local_amount":352779,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":356174.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157014,"comment":null},{"amount":91.47,"local_amount":178473,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":180190.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216508921,"comment":null},{"amount":109.45,"local_amount":213560,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":215615.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320536,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T10:42:28Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204877,"name":"Bokk Jom Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe BOKK JOM est l'un des huit groupes de solidarit\u00e9 du banc Villageois de DIAMAGUENE, il est cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 22 octobre 2007 et compos\u00e9 de 9 membres toutes issus du m\u00eame quartier que porte le nom du Banc Villageois.

Her biggest challenge was when she wound up the company and it cost her a lot of  work to fulfill her partner's financial share, but today it is already a thing of the past and she has to focus on getting ahead to see her 8 year old son grow up enjoying good living conditions and progressing.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":547772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Products by the gallon such as degreasing soap and car polishing wax.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-31T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73894},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65225},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66584},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67971},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69387},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70833},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72308},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73815},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75353},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64630}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":73894,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":77984.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895875,"comment":null},{"amount":34.94,"local_amount":65225,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":68835.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636213,"comment":null},{"amount":72.08,"local_amount":134555,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":142003.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850310,"comment":null},{"amount":119.81,"local_amount":223651,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":236031.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117067,"comment":null},{"amount":108.58,"local_amount":202675,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":213894.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410936,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-02T21:34:04Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204887,"name":"Luz Helena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luz Helena vive en Bogot\u00e1,  tiene una peluquer\u00eda  que inici\u00f3 hace m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os, teniendo en cuenta la profesi\u00f3n de su esposo como estilista;  ellos empezaron con dinero que le facilit\u00f3 un familiar para poner en marcha su sue\u00f1o y proyecto de vida familiar.

A relative provided them with enough money to start the business and to set off their dream and their project for their family life. Since then, Luz Helena and her husband have been working in the hairdressing business: they offer beauty treatments such as drying, massaging, hairdos, dyeing, perms, haircuts and hair straightening: they highlight male and female beauty and create new images that, according to the expectations of their customers, can be elegant, formal or informal. Luz Helena is now requesting her first loan to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo (Mario Santo Domingo Foundation) to buy a wider quantity of hairdresser\u2019s products (dyes, shampoos, hair rinses, conditioners) than the amount she now has, something that would be very useful because with the loan she would reduce the expenses of the daily consumption, thus making this business more appealing and easier to reinvest.\nHer biggest dream is to grow in this business with her family, and to open 2 hairdresser\u2019s thus generating more work; her biggest challenge is exactly to achieve this goal, as she doesn\u2019t have much time to dedicate to the initial phase of her new business plan. In fact, her present activity takes too much time, since the neighborhood where they work is a busy commercial area, and this means there is always a lot of work for them; moreover, she needs to dedicate a great attention to and a put greater effort in the caring of her two children, aged 5 and 10.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emanuela Villa, Kiva

","en":"The group AND-JEF from the Banc Villageois of HLM, on the GOSSAS Road was created 6 months ago. They have just finished repaying their first loan with CAURIE-MF and no irregularity was found in their repayment of their loan. They all come from the same neighborhood and mostly sell cloth, incense, perfume, cosmetics, etc. Before joining CAURIE-MF, they had come together as a group with the same economic interests and participated in \"merry-go-round\" funds (revolving small loans), which allowed them to stay in business. Since they began to receive CAURIE-MF loans, they have been able to intensify and expand their field of activity. They are very united as far as possibilities for diversifying their businesses go. \r\n\r\nMadame Bineta T., the president of the group, on the far right in the photo, wrapped in a length of flowered cloth, is 51, married, and the mother of four children as well as being responsible for her cousin. She has been selling cloth for more than 10 years. She buys wholesale in Dakar and sells in her neighborhood and the surrounding areas.  Her new loan will serve to reinforce her working capital and her goal is to be able to put aside more savings and help to improve living conditions for her family, for example improving their nutrition and making sure her children have everything they need to stay healthy. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":548180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"develop and promote the business activities of the group ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Diourbel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-06-02T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bineta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efssata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isseu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djigu\u00e8ne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mame Diarra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thiouthio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Kane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndi\u00e9y\u00e9ly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mame Diallo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":875000,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":875000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1650,"local_amount":875000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T10:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":881985.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182517935,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T17:21:02Z","paid_date":"2011-01-08T10:40:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204900,"name":"Buenalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The loans that Buenalyn P. has obtained from ASHI since she became a member in 2005 are a great source of cash flow for her family.

A., 53, was one of the poorest among the poor women who joined ASHI in 1997. She hoped that someday through loans requested from ASHI, she would be able to have an established business to support her in bringing her family out of the umbrella of poverty.  She and her husband started cultivating a small parcel of land in their backyard, growing rice and vegetables to sell. They were both very familiar with this occupation from childhood, having learned the skills from their farmer parents. After receiving several loans since joining ASHI, their business eventually improved, as did the quality of their family life. Using her profit, Maria was able to send her two children to a vocational course in college and has been supporting the needs of her eldest child, who is unemployed due to his limited education. \r\n\r\nSince farming is the main source of Maria\u2019s financial need to support her dream of improving her family's standard of living, she hopes to make it sustainable and profitable. With more capital, she plans to purchase equipment, a variety of vegetable seedlings, and a better variety of rice seedlings to increase her sales turnover and profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n

O. is from the town of Talibon. She is 56 years old. To make a living, Esmeralda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Esmeralda has been engaged in her business for over 3 years already.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Esmeralda joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Esmeralda has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Esmeralda is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Esmeralda from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business.\r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She is the one raising her hand in the photo and is vice-president of the loan group Baraka Office. She is 42, a widow and mother of six children, all enrolled in school. Her eldest daughter is in the first year at university, and the others are in secondary or primary school. Her husband died after a long illness, around the year 2000, of HIV AIDS. \r\n\r\nEkanga L. lives in the Murara neighborhood, township of Karisimbi, and she has a charcoal depot in the Birere district. Moreover, in order to maximize her income, she also sells palm oil wholesale in the market of KIBABI. Ekanga L. began her business with her own funds around 2002, before the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which completely destroyed the economic life of the town of Goma. She was selling fritters with a working capital of $12.50. And all this after her husband's death. \r\n\r\nIn view of her family responsibilities and living alone, she was just scraping by. However, in 2004, she received a first loan from the MFI Hekima. From then on, she was able to reestablish her social and economic equilibrium. Ekanga L. has already managed to achieve some family goals, notably the purchase of a plot of land. If God grants her long life, Ekanga L. intends to continue to be ambitious enough, despite being a widow, to build a house for her children. With the loan from Hekima, widow Ekanga L. hopes to grow her sales by buying 10 sacks of charcoal (for her charcoal business) and 5 barrels of oil (locally known as \u00abKafindondo\u00bb.) \r\n\r\nEkanga L. says that the major challenge to her charcoal business is the multiple attacks along the route carried out by outlaws who are hiding in the Virunga National Park, in the east of the DRC, and Rwandan Hutu rebels from the FDLR. Also the police and administrators make difficulties, especially since the State has threatened to bring to justice those they say are destroying the environment (people who sell wood from the national park). As for her oil sales business, she sometimes buys a load of spoiled oil or poor quality oil which has lost all its flavor, since this oil is produced by local artisans in the province of Kindu-Maniema and way up north near Lake Kivu, around Beni, or Mangina, and sometimes stored in dirty jerrycans or rubber containers that are fragile, etc. This can cause her an enormous loss. \r\n\r\nWidow Ekanga L. would like to thank the MFI Hekima for the loans that she receives without collateral since it is thanks to these loans that she is managing to support her orphaned children. The Baraka Office group is composed of eight women. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":548326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"10 sacks of charcoal and 5 barrels of oil (locally known as \u00abKafindondo\u00bb)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo","town":"Goma, North Kivu province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":160,"posted_date":"2010-06-02T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ekanga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mulamba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonve","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kahindo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Therese","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oleka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bashani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kavira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":470.64,"local_amount":470.64,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":470.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151915738,"comment":null},{"amount":751.01,"local_amount":751.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":751.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159656120,"comment":null},{"amount":584,"local_amount":584,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":584,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166870547,"comment":null},{"amount":694.35,"local_amount":694.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":694.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172137035,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T00:05:18Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:15:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204942,"name":"Sen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sen S. is 39 years old and has been selling a few fresh fish in and around the community for more than nine years.

She is a 46-year-old married woman, and she has one son who is 30 years old.  She was unable to have any more children, and her son is currently unemployed.  Elmina finished sixth grade but had to interrupt her studies because of an early pregnancy.  She lives in her own house and takes care of her parents, who live in Marracuene, by sending them 800 meticais' worth of food and household goods every month.\r\n\t\r\nElmina was invited by her aunt to come live in Namaacha, which is on the border with Swaziland.  After her arrival, she continued with her studies, and when she was in sixth grade she became pregnant.  Some years later, she began to work in mukero (sale of contraband goods) on the Swaziland border, but because the work was very hard, she decided to begin selling basic goods from her home.  With her savings she built a small store in her home.  Her best products are rice and sugar, which she buys by the sack for 850 meticais per four sacks and 1800 meticais per two sacks, respectively.  She sells them for 1,250 meticais per four sacks and 2,050 meticais per two sacks.  Elmina manages to save 1,000 meticais per month.  She counts on the help of her husband, who works in government as the neighborhood Secretary.\r\n\r\nThis is Elmina's third loan with Hluvuku-Adsema and Kiva.  The others were for 10,000 meticais each, and were used to purchase products (rice, beans, sugar and other items) to increase the inventory of her store.  She is confident that she will pay back the loan ahead of schedule.  In the future, she intends to apply for more loans and build a large store to meet her customers' needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She is married and has three children between the ages of 19 and 25.  The two eldest have jobs in education, and only the youngest still goes to school.  L\u00facia lives in her own house with her family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nL\u00facia became pregnant in sixth grade and quit school.  After the birth of her child, L\u00facia continued to live in her parents' house, and they took care of her during the most difficult time of her life.  Some years later, she returned to school and finished tenth grade.  After that, she immediately took a teaching course in Namaacha District, which is on the border with Swaziland.\r\n\r\nShe quit the class when she got together with her current husband, who gave her the money to start her own business selling pots which she buys in Maputo and resells in Swaziland.  She still does this work on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the open-air market.  L\u00facia earns about 6,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also manages to save some money with the help of the vegetable garden in her yard, where she grows lettuce and cabbage.\r\n\r\nThis is L\u00facia's seventh loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  The first six loans were for 5,000 meticais, 5,000 meticais, 12,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais and 10,000 meticais.  They were used to increase her inventory, and she paid them back with no problems.  She is now asking for 12,000 meticais for the same purpose.  L\u00facia is confident that she will pay off this loan ahead of schedule and ask for another loan for a construction project.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

He is married, and has a 2-year-old daughter who is not yet in school.  Felix only finished 10th grade. He didn't continue with his studies because he had to begin working due to his family\u2019s lack of financial resources. He lives in his uncle\u2019s house and is not financially responsible for anyone beyond his immediate family.\r\n\r\nFelix has always lived in Namaacha. Due to his parents\u2019 lack of financial resources, his uncle invited Felix to live with him. That same year, his uncle was transferred to Maputo, leaving Felix with the house.  Felix managed to get a job as a plumber with a monthly salary of 2250 meticais. He uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves 500 meticais each month through Xitique, a traditional system of rotating savings.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to increase his family\u2019s income, Felix is asking for a loan through Hluvuku and Kiva to buy used clothing for resale. This is an enterprise that he\u2019s already undertaken with the help of his wife. On average he buys 2 packs for 8000 meticais; the best type for him is a pack of nightclothes, with which he can make a profit of 3000 meticais. \r\n\r\nThis is Felix\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva, for 12,000 meticais. He will use the money to buy packs of used clothing. He is confident that he will be able to repay the loan even earlier than required so that he can request another loan to build his own house, and move out of his uncle\u2019s house.

She is a widow and has 4 children who range in age from 9 to 26 years old. The three youngest children are in school. She lives in her own home and is not financially responsible for anyone except her children.\r\n \r\nAfter finishing her primary education, Alice was transferred to the district seat of Namaacha, which is 25 kilometers from the town of Goba where she was born. She continued with her studies and finished 7th grade. Then she got pregnant and went to live with her husband, who was an important businessman. This is why she left school. Years later, her husband died after an illness and life became difficult. It was then that she managed to get a job in the capital, Maputo, as a household servant. She held this job for 2 years, receiving a salary of 2300 meticais per month. \r\n\r\nShe had to leave this job because she was living far from her children, and so she returned to Namaacha. There she began her own business selling bread and candy from the yard of her house.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to increase the scope of her business, she has approached Hluvuku to ask for a loan to help her to raise baby chicks. She had already started with this enterprise using the profit she made after getting her previous loan. She has raised on average 2 cartons full during each cycle, costing 15,000 meticais and making a profit of 6000 meticais. She uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some 1000 meticais each month.\r\n\r\nThis is Alice\u2019s 2nd loan with Hluvuku and Kiva, for the amount of 12000 Meticales. She plans to use the loan to increase the number of chicks she raises. Her previous loan, in the amount of 10,000 meticais, was used to start her sales of candy.\r\n\r\nAlice is confident that she will have no problems repaying this loan because she also has income from the rental of a house she owns in Boane. In the future she would like to get another loan to build her own store, so that she no longer has to sell from her own yard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

Lorta is unmarried and had 4 children. Three of her children died, but one still lives and is employed at a private firm. She lives in her own home with her son, her daughter-in-law, and her 3 grandchildren, all of whom attend school.  \r\n\r\nAt age 15, Lorta began her studies, and finished the 2nd year of secondary school under the old education system. After this she became pregnant. After her children died during the Mozambican Civil War, she became despondent. Her sister invited Lorta to live with her in the district of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland. After moving there she began to work as a domestic servant.\r\n\r\nWith her earnings, Lorta started her own business, and then built a house with the profit from that enterprise. However, due to expenses related to her son\u2019s wedding she is close to bankruptcy. For this reason she is asking for a loan in the amount of 8000 meticais to shore up her business. She works two days a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, selling at an unofficial market where people trade in imported goods. She earns about 5000 meticais per month and uses this income to cover household expenses. She also saves some each month.\r\n\r\nThis is Lorta\u2019s 3rd loan with Hluvuku and her 2nd with Kiva. The first loan, in the amount of 8000 meticais, was used to help shore up her business. The second, in the amount of 10,000 meticais, was used to increase her stock of merchandise. This third loan, for 15,000 meticais, will be used for the same purpose, to buy packs of used clothing for resale.

Now she is borrowing Php 15,000 for her 5th loan which she intends to use to fund her fishing activities.\r\n\r\nDioscora is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Of her children, four are adults and three are of school age.\r\n\r\nMa. Luz has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.

Luz is now borrowing Php 21,000 so that she can buy materials to repair her fishing boat. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of Php 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.\r\n\r\nMa.

Jos\u00e9 feels that this contribution will be a great help to the development of his business.  He is proud of the fact that he is recognized as one of the most responsible members of his Communal Bank.  With this loan of 1200 PEN that he requested, Jos\u00e9 will buy more compost and insecticides for his farmland.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":548441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase compost & insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-04T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":199.73,"local_amount":563.95,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":568.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326750,"comment":null},{"amount":225.27,"local_amount":636.05,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":640.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270305,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T18:09:56Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204994,"name":"Adriana Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adriana de 28 a\u00f1os, vive en la Primavera de Duran (per\u00edmetro urbano fue originalmente irregular, con varios cerros, riachuelos y lagunas que a\u00fan se presentan como restos de una ecolog\u00eda en disoluci\u00f3n), tiene dos hijos. \n\nPor la falta de oportunidades y la desesperante idea de tener ingresos para sus hijos ella es empleada domestica, con los pocos ingresos que ha tenido ha invertido su dinero en productos naturales para vender a sus amigos y conocidos. \n\nPero como la casa de Adriana no es muy c\u00f3moda para sus hijos ella quiere construirla y mejorarla.

She washes it on the third day and sends it to the mill to be milled. She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it to prove for the next day. She divides the proved dough into two and uses one half for her firm half-cooked dough. She mixes it with water to get it into a porridge form, cooks it for some time to get a firm mixture or texture of the dough. Then she mixes the rest of the uncooked dough with the half-cooked portion. She moulds into balls and wraps them in corn husk. She cooks them again till they become soft to eat. Kenkey can be eaten with various kinds of sauces such as pepper sauce, with fried or roasted fish, roasted chicken, roasted turkey or any other kind of meat or fish.\r\n\r\nEkua is married and lives with six dependants.
