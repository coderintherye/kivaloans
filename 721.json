This family lives in the warmth of their own home in the district of Palcamayo.  Thanks to his abilities and skill, Edgar has known how to carry out his activities with great efficacy.\r\n\r\nAs a child, he learned how to work the land at the side of his parents.  Currently, he has potato, olluco and oca (Peruvian tubers) crops.  At harvest time, his product sells very well at the wholesale market in Tarma.\r\n\r\nHe also has 250 heads of sheep and some cows.  With these animals, he was able to start a business selling meat.  \u201cFor each fair, I butcher 2 sheep and sell their meat, head, hide, and the hooves and giblets,\u201d he comments, adding that his business\u2019 profits hinge on capturing repeat customers.  To facilitate both activities, Edgar counts on a small truck that he uses to transfer his crops, animals and other products.\r\n\r\nIncreasing his tuber production is one of his goals, as well as opening meat sales stalls at the market in Tarma, which is why he continues to work arduously.

Animal husbandry and farming is the primary business of Narynkul's family.  In 2005, she decided to start her own business of fattening up and reselling livestock and investing an initial amount of 2,000 som (KGS) into the purchase of livestock.  Today, her business has 10 sheep and one cow and yields a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS).  Narynkul also has 3.2 hectares of arable land, where she grows wheat, barley, clover and potatoes.  Earnings from this business allowed her to provide education for her children, who became teachers.  In order to further grow her business, Narynkul requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase sheep.  She plans to use the income from the loan to repair a barn for livestock.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Fred will educate his children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Wesakulila SHG group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nHe is pictured with his group members in the photograph."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":926136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T18:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caleb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Winnie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":54600,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-25T20:20:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":361396,"name":"Khudoikul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0443\u043b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 6 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430, \u0430 \u043e\u043d \u0441\u0430\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 10 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0443. \u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0443\u043b \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f, \u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433. \u0427\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 1000$ \u0421\u0428\u0410. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0441.","en":"Khudoikul has been involved in buying and selling livestock for over six years.

Five of her children are already married and live independently. Mrs. Pich is in the business of cultivating rice crops.

In order to improve the living conditions, her son, Mr. Sen (22) decided to work as a blacksmith for an entrepreneur in the province. Over the past few years, Mr. Sen has learned a lot from his work experiences. Now he wants to run this type of business for himself in his commune.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Peter will save for the future and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Kopiya Farmers Group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph, Peter is pictured with his group members.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":926250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T21:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dedan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ainea","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mourine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":74900,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T22:53:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":361475,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia is 38 years-old and lives in the Philippines.

She is widow with two children ages 12 and 14 who both attend school. Lamrana also supports her two nieces who live with her since she is in the city, where there are better schools. In 2000, Lamrana established a business selling cereals and groundnuts. She began her business because her late father believed that girls were not meant for school, so she was not able to attend school. Since her mother was a businesswoman, Lamrana decided to join her, and she has had her business since she was a teenager. She works 10-hour days, seven days a week, and earns about 2,866,000 SLL each month. She has an outdoor stall and the rainy season is her major challenge as she has enough goods to meet her customer\u2019s needs. Lamrana serves housewives and people around the city center, serving over 10 people each day with good prices. She employs a cousin to help her and she gets her supplies wholesale from neighboring villages. \r\n\r\nLamrana is requesting a 4,500,000 SLL loan to purchase groundnuts, benni seeds, and soya beans. She has repaid two previous loans. She feels that her loans are a great help because she cannot do business without money. Lamrana is excited about the status of her business and hopes that her loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 430,000 SLL.  In the future, she plans to build a house.  If Lamrana is given chance to access more loans, she wants expand to a much better business location.

She began her business because she was unprivileged to attend school and her father forced her into early marriage at the age of 15 years to a businessman. They did business together for some years but later her husband gave her some money to establish her own business, which has grown over the years from a stall to a shop.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about 1,066,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business.

She serves 10 customers each day.   \r\n\r\nHer business is popular because she is honest and sells at a reduce price. Her suppliers are located in Bo Town and Sanda.

He is married and his spouse assists him in the business. He has three children, aged 21, 16 and 10 years; only two are school-going children. \r\n\r\nIn 1987, Nabieu established his business selling shoes, school\/traveling bags, electrical appliances, tools, slippers, sandals, door locks, etc. He began his business because his father was a farmer and he was introduced to farming at an early age. He didn't go to school. After farming with his father for some years, he decided to farm on his own. He grew peppers in two farming seasons and he sold the harvest he got, then bought slippers and started selling in the village.  \r\n\r\nAfter some months, he started moving to nearby villages. The business has grown from peddling to a shop. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about 2,310,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Nabieu has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase shoes - 2 cartons @ L840,000; traveling bags - 50 pieces @ Le35,000; sandals - 15 dozen @ Le96,000; door locks - 20 pieces @ Le10,000; and slippers - 1 carton @ Le400,000.  The balance of Le30,000 will be used to pay laborers. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 431,063. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Nabieu plans to build another house and educate his children to the university level. He also plans to improve the standard of living of his family. He is happy about the loan, and this will help him to increase his income. His major challenge is the fluctuation in foreign currency, which sometimes affects the cost of items and transportation. Competition is high but he is different from his competitors because he sells different items. He can serves 15 customers each day. His business is popular because he sells quality items and his shop is general merchandise. He is assisted by his wife.  \r\n\r\nHis suppliers are in Guinea-Conakry; he transports his items by public vehicle and he buys three times in a month. He plows the profit back into the business. He is planning to expand his business, and this will be achieved by managing the business well.

He is married to a trader, and has five children aged 15, 10, 8, 6 and 3 years, three are school going children. In 2001, Alie established his pot making business. He began his business because he went into blacksmith work when he lost his father at the age of 16 years and there was nobody to support his education.  His mother was a housewife and since there was no money to support his schooling, she sent him to a blacksmith workshop to be trained in making pots.  Now he is a specialist in making pots.  Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, he earns about Le 2,140,875 every month from this business.  \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000.  Alie has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to produce the following - 8 big sets of pots, 5 medium sets of pots, and 7 small sets of pots. The balance Le 30,000 will be used to transport the raw materials.  \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 2,140,88. In the future, Alie plans to acquire his own workshop and educate his children to the university level which he was able to do himself.  His major problem is that sometimes he can make a pot and missed the dimensions that will lead to him having to redo it to get the correct quality. He serves about 15 customers each day, his business is popular because he is the only pot maker around that locality.  He has three trainees in his workshop.  He gets his raw materials from Freetown and Makeni Township.  He usually transports his materials by public transport. He plows back the profit into the business. \r\n\r\nHe thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":292.5,"image":{"id":926489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to produce new pots at his blacksmith shop and transport the raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T18:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721828,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124737,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505643,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-25T00:51:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
