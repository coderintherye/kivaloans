She took me all over town visiting the other clients. When it came to visiting Frisita Nakieya we had to get on a boda boda (motorbike) to reach Frisita\u2019s still. (That\u2019s right; still, as in moonshine.) So, Carol gets us a boda boda driver and tells me to hop on. Then she tells me to squeeze up tight to the driver - real tight. And with one more big push she climbs on behind me, riding side saddle! Between the driver and Carol, I was as happy and as bubbly as a slice of hot cheese in a grilled cheese sandwich. We went for 45 minutes on a dirt trail through the hills with views of Lake Victoria that brought tears to your eyes. Man, this is what traveling is all about! But this is a story of Carol and her business.<\/p>\r\n<p>Carol owns a hair salon called Mama Emannuel\u2019s Beauty Salon. As I indicated before, she is a classy, well-dressed lady with a heck of a spirit. She has been operating her salon for 8 years and for the past 10 years has been bringing her upbeat attitude to her lending group. At 32 years old, she is married with 5 children.

then there\u2019s Frisita. I don\u2019t know what it is about these remote villages, but they sure do have their share of characters! As I mentioned in another story, Kiyinde is a very remote fishing village on the shores of Lake Victoria. Frisita insisted that I see her business, though it was a 45 minute boda boda ride into the dense tropical forest on a rutted dirt trail. (Read Carol Nakintu's story for more detail). Having come from the wine country of Northern California, I know the smell of fermenting alcohol, and I could smell Frisita\u2019s business at least a quarter mile away.\r\nWe got off the boda boda and walked through a large thicket of sugar cane. Right in the middle was what you see in the picture. When in operation, a cow is attached to the log and sugar cane is pressed through the press in the middle squeezing the juices into a bucket in the middle. The raw sugar and juice is then placed in 50 gallon drums to start fermenting. There were five 50 gal. drums full to the brim all bubbling from the fermentation. After fermentation, the liquid is taken to a 50 gal. drum that is laying sideways over a smoldering fire next to a cool stream that was just below. In the stream is a another 50 gal. drum that is kept cool by the stream. A hose connects the two drums. The heated fermented liquid releases the alcohol up the hose and then drips into the cooled drum in the stream and viola! Moonshine!<\/p>\r\n<p>Now you may wonder why you might want to invest in moonshine. But I\u2019m here to tell you that even if you think this is not the best cause going, you can at least brag to your friends that you\u2019re a moonshiner! And for me, this is a story I will be telling for a long time! The world needs more Frisita\u2019s!! In a more serious manner, her business in Uganda is considered legitimate.

The joy of children is quite evident. There is not a lot to do and the men are out fishing all day. What I notice are the women all look after each other in a special way. Caring for babies unites them. Since there are few or no jobs, women have plenty of time to visit as they watch after each others' babies. The land is fertile  so food is plentiful and easy to grow, so you do not have to worry about getting food, and the lake provides ample fish.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sepi has a small retail store in Kiyinde.

The wish of this hardworking mother, who spends long hours doing laundry for her clients, is to acquire a laundry machine, in order to reduce the physical effort and soon be able to open a laundry to offer services to the whole community.    \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAquilina siempre ha estado dedicada al trabajo y adquiri\u00f3 una ense\u00f1anza de valor que ahora aplica en su vida misma e impuls\u00f3 a que aprendan sus hijos; as\u00ed, con mucha diligencia y creatividad, busca la forma de crear negocios y servicios que la ayudan a sobresalir. Desde su juventud viajaba a distintas ciudades para vender diferentes art\u00edculos tales como prendas de vestir, cosm\u00e9ticos, etc. Cuando se cas\u00f3 ya no pudo dedicarse a este negocio de la misma manera, por lo que decidi\u00f3 ofertarlos a sus vecinas; sin embargo, la necesidad fue a\u00fan m\u00e1s apremiante cuando su esposo falleci\u00f3 y ten\u00eda la responsabilidad de velar por sus peque\u00f1os, ahora sin ayuda y compa\u00f1\u00eda. Este hecho la condujo a una crisis econ\u00f3mica muy preocupante; a pesar de ello, sigui\u00f3 ocup\u00e1ndose en diversos oficios y labores seg\u00fan se presentaban las oportunidades, aceptando muchas veces trabajos que requer\u00edan gran esfuerzo f\u00edsico. Aquilina, despu\u00e9s de su ardua lucha, puede ver con satisfacci\u00f3n a sus hijos convertidos en personas que pueden valerse por si mismos y preparados para enfrentar situaciones cr\u00edticas de escasez. Hoy s\u00f3lo vive con dos de sus hijas, que son madres solteras. El deseo de esta trabajadora madre, que dedica interminables horas a lavar las prendas y frazadas de otras personas, es adquirir una lavadora a fin de aminorar su esfuerzo y pronto establecer una lavander\u00eda para ofrecer sus servicios a su comunidad entera."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":98125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of a laundry machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-12-16T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aquilina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-30T22:33:53Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-01-31T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":175.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125336,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":175.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145682,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":175.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170070,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":175.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196800,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-05-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":175.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224146,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":157.14,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":163.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":253081,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-16T22:33:53Z","paid_date":"2008-06-30T09:19:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":27735,"name":"Angela Marlene","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Angela Marlene, 45, is a kindergarden teacher in the Peruvian \"departamento\" of La Libertad.

They hire workers to level the field by using water buffaloes or tractors. Then the workers will plant the seedlings and clear off any wild plants. This group of men are from  the same tribe and area, which allowed to help each other out. Their wishes are to let their children to have better education, and a better economy.\r\n\r\n <p><b>Translated from Bahasa by Maria Hernandez, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nKelompok ini beranggotakan 10 orang yang kesemuanya adalah para petani. Mereka mengusahakan tanah mereka dengan menanam padi dan rata-rata setiap petani mempunyai lahan 10 are. Di tanah yang 10 are ini para petani membutuhkan modal yang tidak sedikit karena mereka harus menyiapkan pupuk sekitar 100 kilogram, bibit sebanyak 5 kilogram, obat-obatan untuk hama, biaya perawatan dan jasa para pekerja. Para petani membutuhkan tenaga pembantu seperti buruh traktor untuk membajak tanah baik itu menggunakan tenaga tradisional (sapi, kerbau) ataupun menggunakan tenaga mesin (traktor), pekerja untuk menanam bibit padi, membersihkan gulma (tanaman liar) serta para pekerja untuk memanen padi tersebut. Kelompok ini terdiri dari para kaum bapak yang ada di satu dusun atau satu desa yang tentunya tempatnya berdekatan sehingga memudahkan bagi mereka untuk saling mengontrol satu dengan yang lainnya. Harapan-harapan mereka tentunya dapat menyekolahkan anaknya lebih baik lagi, keadaan ekonomi akan lebih meningkat sehingga keluarga mereka akan semakin baik dikemudian

Many Tanzanians still do their cooking in small coal pots in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal pieces) and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene to light the flame. The fire requires constant fanning, which makes cooking a hot, laborious task.

She also bought appliances and cooking utensils but the most help she received from Banco Comunal was advice on how to educate her children with love and care.   <p>\r\n\r\nIn her business, Mabel sells fruit - an activity she learned from her mother when she was a little girl.  Mabel buys prickly pear cactus, which is a fruit native to the region and sells it wholesale at markets in Lima.  In these same markets, she also buys fruits like papaya, apples, pepino, and others that are in high demand to sell in Ayacuchan markets. <p>\r\n\r\nHowever, Mabel has another business where she sells auto spare parts from her home.  She started this business 10 years ago because her husband was a mechanic.  At the time, she thought about supplying the parts that her husband needed.  This is how Mabel started delivering parts from Lima.  Now, her store has spare parts and auto lubricants.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe loan she needs amounts to 3000 Peruvian sols.  The total will be invested in boxes and barrels of car lubricants like oil from Shell.  Her savings will then be used to build a third floor in her house and for her own savings.   Her dream is to buy a cart to transport her load and to have her children become professionals.\r\n\r\n<P><b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Translator.  <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMabel Nelly tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene 3 hijos de 22, 20 y 2 a\u00f1os.

She buys her seeds from suppliers, who bring seeds from farm workers or from collective farms to the market to sell. She buys by large sacks (as you can see in the photo) and sells by retail. Her husband helps her lift her sacks from her warehouse in Panjshanbe to her trade place. Bimukarram says that during her work at the market she attracts a large number of clients and many of them buy her goods for fodder for their house animals. She has also attracted many clients from farther regions that come to purchase seeds from her. Her current turnover is fast and she wishes to purchase the biggest batch of seeds yet, as at the present time the price for seeds is cheaper during harvest gathering."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":99232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Bimukarram would like to increasing the volume of her seeds to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-01-03T15:05:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bimukarram","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-17T17:10:56Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128056,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149075,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173365,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-05-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200563,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-06-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227713,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-03T17:10:56Z","paid_date":"2008-06-04T09:04:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":27975,"name":"Sina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sina S., 26, and her husband, Mr. Chhum Keo, 32, have been married since 2001.

Math E. and his family live in a small village along the Mekong River about twenty kilometers north of Phnom Penh.

The catch has been declining for the past several years, so two years ago he and his wife started gathering recycling materials. They buy discarded household materials, which they then sort and resell to another, larger business in a nearby village. The business that buys their materials bundles them in bulk and then ships everything to Vietnam, a couple hundred kilometers to the east.\r\n<p> \r\nOf the materials Math and his wife collect, aluminum is the most valuable. They also buy and resell iron, steE., copper, hard plastics (such as PVC used in plumbing pipes), glass, paper, fiberboard, automotive batteries (for the lead inside), and any other items they can make some profit on. Math and his wife drive the lanes of their own and the neighboring villages gathering materials household by household. Math drives the motorbike and his wife sits behind holding the cart they pull (see photo).  They don\u2019t make much money doing this, but it does provide their main source of income. With luck, they hope to continue to work and buy a second-hand truck, which would allow them to carry more materials and drive farther.\r\n<p>\r\nMath and his family are requesting this, their second loan from MAXIMA, for $300 to buy discarded household materials."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":99241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase discarded materials for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Muk Kampoul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":61,"posted_date":"2007-12-18T06:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Math","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-01T13:34:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-01T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125901,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":146572,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170767,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197836,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224811,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-07-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":254009,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-08-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":282804,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-09-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":312870,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T07:48:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":327883,"comment":"Pay off the loan."}],"funded_date":"2007-12-18T13:34:26Z","paid_date":"2008-09-17T07:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":27981,"name":"Bahtinisso","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Bahtinisso I. is 34 years old, has a secondary education, is married and has 4 children.

David","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Juan is 36 years of age. His family consists of 7 members: five children who are 18, 16, 15, 12, and 5 years of age, all in school. The eldest studies and works as a secretary in the city of Santa Cruz. The family has rented a home in Ivirgarzama for 10 years. Juan has great projects planned, such as buying his own home, expanding his business, and helping his children develop their careers so that they may have better opportunities in the future. Juan has been repairing and selling spare parts for electronics for 10 years. He is well-experienced in this field. His business is located in Ivirgarzama on Leonardo Quispe Street. He likes the job he has chosen, and studied his trade in a vocational center. He was not able to obtain a college education due to his financial situation. Juan came to his present location from the city of Trinidad because he has more business and job opportunities in this tropical zone. <p>\r\nHe has little competition in this area because there are only about 10 repair centers for television sets, sound systems, DVDs, etc., so the demand is high in this tropical region. The high humidity in this area causes electronic devices to malfunction, so people must turn to technicians, which is favorable for Juan\u2019s business.  <p>\r\nJuan is requesting this loan to buy more spare parts for electronics and thus improve customer service. For example, customers come in to have their electronic devices repaired, and Juan sometimes doesn\u2019t have the necessary parts, which forces him to commute all the way to Cochabamba to get what he needs. This process not only wastes time, but also gives his business a bad reputation. <p>\r\nHe has already requested 3 loans from our institution, and has good credit history. Despite the fact that they were not sizeable, his prior loans have been of great use to him and his business projects. As a result, he has been able to improve his business and his credibility as a technician. He is a growing entrepreneur in our institution. <p>\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nJuan tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, su familia esta compuesta por siete personas cinco hijos de 18,16,15,12 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad entre hombres y mujeres, todos estudian en el colegio, una de ellas que es la mayor estudia y trabaja como secretaria en la ciudad de Santa Cruz, viven en alquiler en la localidad de Ivirgarzama hace 10 a\u00f1os. <p>\r\nJuan tiene grandes proyectos tener una vivienda propia, un negocio mas grande y tambi\u00e9n de poder ver a sus hijos como profesionales para que tengan mayores oportunidades en el futuro. <p>\r\nJuan se dedica a la reparaci\u00f3n y venta de repuestos de artefactos el\u00e9ctricos hace mas de 10 a\u00f1os en la zona, tiene mucha experiencia en el rubro, esta ubicado en la localidad de Ivirgarzama sobre la calle Leonardo Quispe casi Av. Mortenson, le gusta el trabajo que emprendi\u00f3 en su vida, estudio para ello en un instituto de capacitaci\u00f3n, no tuvo oportunidad de entrar a la universidad por razones econ\u00f3micas. Juan migr\u00f3 de la ciudad de trinidad, porque en el tr\u00f3pico hay mayores oportunidades de trabajo y negocio. <p>\r\nLa competencia es menor en la localidad de Ivirgarzama ya que existen alrededor de 10 centros de reparaci\u00f3n de artefactos el\u00e9ctricos espec\u00edficamente televisores, equipos de m\u00fasica, DVDs y otros, la demanda es alta en la zona, porque la zona tropical los artefactos el\u00e9ctricos duran poco tiempo por varios factores sobre todo clima que es muy h\u00famedo, la poblaci\u00f3n necesariamente tiene  que acudir al t\u00e9cnico lo que es muy favorable para Juan David porque hace sostenible su negocio y sus ingresos. <p>\r\nJuan solicito este cr\u00e9dito para la compra de repuestos de aparatos el\u00e9ctricos, para mejorar la calidad de atenci\u00f3n al cliente, por ejemplo un cliente viene y solicita la reparaci\u00f3n y a veces Juan no tiene los repuestos necesarios para utilizarlos y necesariamente tiene que viajar a la ciudad de Cochabamba para traerlos cosa que demora mucho y puede representarle una mala imagen a su trabajo. <p>\r\n\u00c9l ya obtuvo varios cr\u00e9ditos con nuestra instituci\u00f3n, en una totalidad de 3 cr\u00e9ditos, con un cumplimiento bueno, a pesar del peque\u00f1o monto que solicito en sus anteriores operaciones, le sirvi\u00f3 mucho, resultado de est\u00e9 mejoro su trabajo y su imagen como t\u00e9cnico, es un cliente creciente en nuestra instituci\u00f3n.
