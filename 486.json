","en":" Ablawa Agathe D. was born on October 1965 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Maried to Simon Koumagnon, Agathe is the mother of four children, all of whom go to school. Since about 15 years ago, Agathe has been living with her family in S\u00e8kandji, in the community of S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji. Agathe provides for family needs alongside her husband, thanks to the income from her business activity. Agathe did not go to school. For about a dozen years,  Agathe has been making a living by selling cereals and groceries out of her home. She stocks up at the Hou\u00e8gbo market, in the Atlantic Department. Agathe has more and more customers and no longer manages to meet all her customers\u2019 needs, given her financial resources. Thus, in order to strengthen her business and better respond to customer demand, Agathe is seeking her first loan from ALID\u00e9.

The loan consultant who has been working with Ana describes her as a strong, hard-working woman with a healthy appetite for learning and big plans for the future. \r\n\r\nAna runs two businesses. Over the past 4 years, she has gained experience selling various items such as jewellery, clothing, cosmetics and shoes from her home, where she has opened a bazaar (seen in the picture). Her customers arrive daily to peruse the various products she has available for sale. This business arrangement allows Ana to take care of domestic responsibilities when business is slow, including taking care of her mother and children. \r\n\r\nHer other business is selling catalog items such as cooking utensils, appliances and clothing. For this activity, Ana travels from door to door in her community, offering catalog products to customers. She has been running her business in this way over the past four years, and she has one employee.  In a good month Ana earns 700,000 colones, in a bad month, only 300,000. \r\n\r\nAna has a large space in her home to display a varied range of products. She says competition is basically nonexistent in the area in which she lives. The majority of her clients are workers at a nearby plastic manufacturing plant; others are family members and acquaintances in the community.  Sometimes, her children help her with her business so that Ana can take care of her mother.\r\n\r\n Ana plans to use this loan to invest in both of her productive activities. She hopes to invest in the purchase of various merchandise items such as clothing, jewellery, cosmetics and cooking utensils. \r\n\r\nIn general, Ana wakes up early in order to carry out her domestic responsibilities such as preparing breakfast, cleaning the house and assisting her mother.  When she is not doing housework, she is dedicated to making sales, whether in the bazaar or on the street. Ana\u00b4s goal is to expand her business and provide a prosperous lifestyle for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":628921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"For the

She sells both new and used clothes and works from very early in the morning until very late in the evening. Her business is the only source of income that supports her family, so she tries to give her all to make the business successful. Thanks to this business, she has been able to support her daughter in her nursing studies, and this fills her with pride.\r\nJulia is a woman who has already had loans financed by Kiva. This is her third loan and she told us that the loans she had previously enabled her to buy goods for her business during the different sales season. For this opportunity, she wants to get new clothes for the business, particularly summer season clothes because the heat is already starting to be felt in the area and she wants to have enough stock to respond to demand once the season changes. For this reason she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of $375.\r\nShe is happy and grateful to the people who collaborate with her through the Kiva program.

His is a humble family of few financial resources, but they are very hardworking. They live 26 km from the city of Cochabamba. For them, going to a bank to get a loan is very difficult. He took the initiative to go to this rural area. Gualberto needed money to buy organic fertilizer and seed potatoes for this year's sowing. Gualberto told us that the agricultural production this year has been low because of climatic factors such as drought. If he doesn't sow crops this year he will not have food or money saved-up to look after his family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":629103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy organic fertilizer and seeds.

The eleven members of this lending group are part of AMK\u2019s Loan Workout Program. All clients have outstanding loans that are delinquent and they are currently unable to pay back the full amount of their existing loan.\r\n\r\nTheir business ventures, which they funded using their existing loan, have failed, putting them in a very unfortunate position. In addition, less work at garment factories and sickness in their families have drastically reduced other sources of income for each family. All eleven clients will use their loan to start a new business making ties and pillow cases.\r\n\r\nAs part of AMK\u2019s workout program, each client is given a workout loan that will be used to purchase sewing machines, an electricity line and additional sewing equipment. AMK has hired a tailor to train the group to make ties and pillow cases. The material will be provided by AMK to ensure that quality material is used and so that the clients do not have to purchase it themselves.\r\n\r\nAMK has partnered with Ahkun.org to sell their ties and pillow cases online. Fifty percent of all profits will go to this group and the other borrowers in their village who are unable to repay their loan.\r\n\r\nThis program is in contrast to the traditional ways that microfinance institutions deal with delinquent clients.  These traditional ways are:\r\n\u2022 By rescheduling the loan and pushing off the problem to another day\r\n\u2022 Repossessing items that the clients own, including their house or land.\r\n\r\nBecause of AMK\u2019s strong social mission, AMK has created this program to provide an alternative solution to one of microfinance\u2019s dark sides.

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin. \r\n<br>\r\n<b>About Patan Business and Professional Women<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. It operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

By working hard at her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000. Paterna is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Paterna aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

C. is a married woman who lives in Purok Tuhay, Brgy. Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a General Store and a Rice Retailer business. Her husband Francisco, who is 66 years old, works as a Driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n\r\nThey have 3 children who are between 33 to 38 years old. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and rice to sell so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of business.   Teresita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)  is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business venture: a General Store business. \r\n\r\nIlluminada joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Illuminada has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to buy raw materials for her home repairs and stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of business.  Illuminada J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods and instant noodles in the local community.

Leonora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Leonora from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Bushra is very confident that her husband\u2019s seven years of experience will give him the right direction and the loan investment will help him for financial growth. \r\n \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 3rd loan application. In previous loan years, she has proved herself a responsible client who paid her installments on time and never missed any meeting.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":629326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

S. is a 41-year-old from Centro Norte, Culasi Antique, Philippines married to Emelio S.. The fruit of their sweetest love are their four children. Her eldest child is already 14 years old while the youngest is 6 years old and all of them are still studying. Ice cream vending is their primary source of  income; this is where they get money for their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nSince all of their children are studying, they must strive hard in order to survive and meet the basic needs of the family. They wake up early in the morning just to prepare the ice cream because after their breakfast her husband sells that ice cream in the nearby neighborhoods. As food vendors, they maintain the quality of their products so that they gain more customers because they say, customers are very important in business.\r\n\r\nAside from ice cream vending, Elarian also makes salted and coated peanuts and she sells them to their neighbors and distributes to some stores. \r\n\r\nElarian has been an active member of ASHI Antique North Branch since 2005. She maintains 100%  rate in repayment, attendance and project. She has also accessed incentive loans of ASHI such as House Repair Loan and Educational Loan because of her good performance as a member.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to improve their production and to send their children to school until college. She wants their children to become professionals someday. They also wish that someday their business will improve so that they can help their relatives and neighbors by providing jobs for them.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan in ASHI, Elarian is planning to buy a tricycle (three-wheeled transport vehicle), so that their products will reach to other neighborhoods and municipalities especially since the fiesta in some neighborhoods in Culasi is approaching. \r\n\r\nDuring fiesta and summer days, ice cream sells quickly; that is why they want to take this opportunity. She needs Php 30,000 in order to realize these dreams and if this request is granted, it would be a great help to them in providing for the basic needs of the family.

With the loan, her husband will buy construction supplies, such as cement, sand and bricks, in bulk quantity, which will enable him to fulfill the larger orders on time and to increase his profit. Farzana is hopeful that this loan investment will become very beneficial for her husband\u2019s business and increase his monthly income.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Farzana is the one who holds a book

Angelita has been in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Angelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase breeding livestock. Angelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock to raise and sell. This will be her third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAngelita is the leader of an eight member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Nigora is 29 years old. She is divorced and has no children. Nigora has a tailoring business at a tailoring shop. Her business is sewing national women's dresses. Her workmanship is very good and, being young, she has a good eye for design.\r\n\r\nShe is very organized and has a good head for business. She has had this business for 12 years and this is her second loan from IMON International. With her loan, Nigora will buy more material for sewing dresses.\r\n\r\nNigora smiles when asked what her dreams are for the future. She quickly replies that she plans to open a workshop, hire seamstresses and expand her business. With her spirit, she will surely succeed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

J. is a 73-year-old woman from Centro Poblacion, Culasi, Antique, Philippines.  She is married to Jesus J. who is 72 years old.  All of their children have their own families and their own houses.\r\n\r\nAlthough she is 73 years old, she is still strong enough to run her business and is mature in dealing with problems.\r\n\r\nEstelita and Jesus are both industrious and work hand in hand in order to survive without depending on their children.  Actually, they are the ones who help their children and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nThe buying and selling of salt is their primary source of income, but sometimes during the fishing season she also engages in fish vending. \r\n\r\nHer loan from ASHI is a big help for them because through the capital entrusted to them, they earn an income and through their income they are able to afford their needs and wants. They already have their own business stalls in the market. Moreover, these businesses not only give them an income, but they also provide pleasure to her.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for a 10,000.00 PHP loan. This amount will be utilized as additional capital to help her buy and sell more salt. She hopes that someday she can become a wholesaler of salt for the entire municipality.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":629395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

D. is 48 years old and lives with her husband and four children in Arhangai province of Mongolia. The family all lives together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. Her youngest son attends high school. Her two children raise their livestock in the countryside. \r\n\r\nSengemaa operates a mobile dairy trading business, in which the family prepares dairy products to sell in the local market. She started this business in 2008, and has built a stable operation. Today, her working capital has reached 500,000 MNT. In the years of running her business, Sengemaa has gained a reputation among her customers as a reliable supplier of quality dairy products.

T. is 34 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Uvurhangai province of Mongolia. He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent in his father's yard. His two children both attend a local secondary school. During the summer time, they live in the countryside herding their livestock and during winter, they move to the central city of the province. Yondonpuntsag operates a milk trading business in his town with the help of his wife. They have eight cows at his home that produce the milk he sells. On average, one of his cows can produce about four liters of milk per day. Yondonpuntsag started his milk trading business in 2007 and has had success in growing his business. He has been grazing cattle for almost his entire life and has gained much experience as a herder. He signed a contract with organizations and individuals to supply milk.

Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture. With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets. With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor.

This school was founded in 2006 by Joko C.R. V., to cater for under-privileged youths in the community. Currently, the school is staffed with twenty-three teachers and has an enrollment of 545 pupils.   \r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org to seek a loan of SLL 7,400,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone can not do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials; some buy a piece of land or pay school fees for their children, while others will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nJoko C.R. V. is the leader of this group of teachers. Born in a village called Rotifunk, Joko is today residing in Waterloo together with his wife and five children. His wife is a businesswoman and three of his children are attending primary and secondary schools. Mr. V., who has served in the teaching profession for thirty years, would like to use his share of this loan to buy house-building materials in order to complete his house-building project. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":629502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy house-building materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-11-02T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joko C.

This is his 20th successful year in the business which is open from 7 am until late in the evening.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jean Claude has long been in this business, his capital is still too low to expand meaningfully. To address this, he needs to request a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company s.a. With this loan, he will purchase additional drinks for sale, which will hopefully increase his revenue.

One of her children is grown up and the two younger ones are still attending school.  Together they work hard to get ahead.  The day begins very early in the morning for this determined woman since, after seeing to her children, she starts work in her business selling soda and beer outside her house.  She is very happy because her work makes her regular profits which allow her to help her husband with the constant household expenses.  She also considers it to be a calm job because she can work from the comfort of her own home and not neglect her children.  She says that she started out with some soda and now sells quite a lot, especially on a weekend.  She has some regular customers and she offers them goods on credit.  As the summer season is approaching she would like to increase her merchandise.  She also plans, in the future, to begin selling some food products and ice cream.

Sandra works here every day to support her household.  She lives in the Robles de Soledad neighborhood together with her husband and her 10 year-old son.  She started her business because she needed to increase her income.  She started by helping her sister-in-law to sell cell phone minutes.  Her sister-in-law then gave her a cell phone plan.\r\n\r\nGradually, because Sandra knew the manicure and pedicure business, she began to offer these services in the homes of neighbors, family members and friends.  With this small business experience, she began to look for a job in her own home so that she didn't have to go out and neglect her household.  For this reason, she gradually began adding to her sale of cell phone minutes, offering telecommunications, printing, Internet and transcription services.  This business  developed and her financial turnover is notable which has excited her husband who has supported her in this undertaking.  The business currently shows growth.  She now has 7 cell phone plans.  She now works less in other people's homes and more in her beauty salon.  The beauty services offer her a contribution margin of 95% because the supplies are low cost.  The cell phone plans give her 75%.  As Sandra is a woman who plans ahead, she is currently studying men's and women's hairdressing and she will complement her work with this new service for which she needs new accessories.  With her Kiva loan she will buy a hair-washing sink, a swivel chair for her hairdressing salon, a mirror and a small display case.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have many services in her hairdressing salon which enhance the images of men, women, boys and girls.  She prepares herself day by day for this and with every opportunity which she has to learn, she is capable of offering her knowledge as a new service to her customers, being careful to establish introductory prices which draw the attention of her

She is qualified in foam crafts and in the production of sandals through the National Learning Service \"SEINE\".  Four years ago she began to sell the supplies for these same products, taking advantage of the fact that many people who were qualified in the skills undertook micro-businesses producing these crafts.  This has assured her a permanent market.  At present Sonia lives with her youngest son.  She is paying for his studies in Psychology thanks to her work in the micro-business, where she sells what she manufactures and also the commodities, materials and supplies of many crafts that she also practices.  Currently she is requesting a loan to buy linings for templates, gallons of glue, platforms, thread, buttons, fabrics, foam and glitter, in order to be prepared for the month of December to make footwear and Christmas decorations, an art that she also knows perfectly.  She expects to increase her sales by 30% since at this time of year the number of clients asking for these articles grows considerably.  On the other hand the production of footwear and of Christmas articles by other micro-businesses dedicated to these activities also increases, and they buy the supplies for their production from Sonia.  Sonia joined the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation 2 years ago and this is her second loan.  With the first one she managed to enlarge her working capital a little and to add new clients.  Her greatest challenge the previous year occurred when there was a decrease in her sales but she managed to add new product lines and thus has managed to maintain her business.  Among her achievements is the recent purchase of her dwelling in this same neighborhood.  She dreams of adapting it, keeping in mind to define a working space, so that her business can function in her own house and she will be able to get to work as quickly as possible.  Sonia has a goal, which is the thing that most drives her work in the micro-business, and it is that of seeing her son become a very successful psychology professional.

He is a traditional afro-columbian dancer and belongs to an important troupe from Barranquilla.  He is a very happy young man who lives in the Las Flores neighborhood and makes his living from two productive businesses.  On the one hand, he purchases live pigs to sell their meat, and on the other hand, he offers a service selling minutes from various cellular operators.  Four years ago, when his father began slaughtering pigs and selling their meat, Deybis used his savings to go into business with his father.  He found customers from the businesses in the industrial zone surrounding his home.  He offered them his services and immediately saw results.  He sells the meat and is paid every 2 weeks.  He purchases his meats in a very well known slaughter house.  Sometimes he purchases animals to fatten them for the public market.  He raises them for 3 or 4 months and then slaughters them once they have reached the optimum growth and girth for selling their meat.  Deybis is a young man whom everyone admires for his charisma and his enterprising spirit.  His parents have been the greatest driving force in his progress in all areas.  They give him a lot of financial advice so that he invests wisely.  He learned all his selling strategies from his parents, who are themselves very good business people.  His mother is a sound client of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo communal bank and is his best reference.  Deybis is very active.  He finished high school and hopes to continue advanced studies at the university.  Currently, in addition to his businesses, he is training to fix and assemble computers.  This is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with it he plans to purchase wholesale pig meat to sell to his customers who are housewives and small business owners that prepare cakes and hayacas (a local dish of cornmeal, meat and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves).  They need his products as a basic supply in the preparation of Christmas and New Years foods.\r\nDeybis has grand plans for a man his age, like opening a dance academy, organizing his family's pig business and helping his family to strengthen their business in order to rise above the competition.  He also wants to be able to offer his one-year old son a promising future. \r\nThe greatest challenge he sometimes faces is that he is affected by the changes in product pricing.  This requires him to study the purveyors on a daily basis to identify who is offering the best price for the healthiest meat product.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":629815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To

He lives simply, at the moment working as a bricklayer while his wife dedicates her time to raising cattle. Although they have a plot of land where he could dedicate his time to farming, Se\u00f1or V. decided to seek other employment because he hasn't enough water to irrigate his land. \r\n\r\nThe bricklaying work is not constant, and when he doesn't have work, Se\u00f1or V. helps his wife in raising cattle. For this he needs feed such as alfalfa and maize - which have to be bought because there is insufficient water to produce their own feed.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that he has asked for a loan: to be able to be a member of a communal well that will permit him to irrigate his plants, and in consequence to produce enough to feed their animals - and in future to increase the size of the herd. \r\n\r\nThis will help him to improve his quality of life.

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Food Vending and tricycle (motorcycle with trailer) transport businesses. Her husband Alberto, who is 48 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 8 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use for maintenance of her tricycle  so that she can continue to save up for future education of their children and improvement of her business. Rosalie G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

R. is from Malabor, Tibiao Antique, Philippines. She is 21 years old, married to Rico R. and they are blessed with one child, Gerica.\r\n\r\nThe couple did not finish their studies because they lacked financial and moral support from their parents. Instead they are already used to working at a very young age and their education has been set aside. Since they are elementary graduates, job opportunities are very few for them; they find difficulty in seeking a job. \r\n\r\nGeraldine now realizes the importance of education and that is why they are really striving in order to earn an income and savings for the future of their children.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, she joined ASHI because she believes that this institution could help them realize their dreams. She maintains her good performance in ASHI because she wants to access more capital so that she will also have a bigger income.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting Php 9,000 for her second loan. This amount will be utilized as additional capital for her business buying and selling fruit and dried fish. The income that they will get from this business is a great help to the family to cover their basic needs.\r\n\r\nFinally, Geraldine is very thankful to ASHI and to those people who give her opportunities despite her educational problems and living conditions. According to her, she will do her best in order to improve her business so that the funders and the institution will not regret putting their trust in

Her husband Fausto, who is 61 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are between 28 and 36 years old. \r\n\r\nRemedios joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remedios has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 60,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to pay for more items for her sari-sari store inventory so that she can continue to save up for the future and to extend her store.\r\n\r\n Remedios O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Loans she received then have enabled her to start up and manage several businesses. First, she started a frozen foods business and with her next loans, she opened rice retail and slaughtering ventures. She sells her products directly to people in their village and in a public market. \r\n\r\nNow, Gloria is requesting another loan from ASHI to support her businesses and to grow them further until such time as they become profitable and stable. For her frozen foods business, she wants to increase the inventory for the convenience of her customers who live around their village. \r\n\r\nGloria happily handles her career being a wife, mother and businesswoman. Her desire to give her only son, Roberto, a second year college student, a better life in the future inspired her to have her own businesses and augment her husband\u2019s irregular income as construction worker (laborer). \r\n\r\nGloria is one of the very good members of ASHI who is requesting a new loan of 42,000 Php to realize her dream of buying more inventory for her frozen foods business and more rice to sell. Profit from these kinds of businesses is quite good compared to other businesses that Gloria has tried. Because of profits she gained from these businesses, Gloria has been able to see her son graduate with a degree and with hopes of having a better career in the future. With her passion for giving her family a better future, Gloria will be willing to work hard and help her husband earn money through her businesses. \r\n\r\nGloria D. is motivated by her desire for personal development so that one day she can be self-reliant in her businesses. Gloria enjoys the system of work groups that is implemented by ASHI. She has benefited from hearing about the experiences of her fellow group members and also appreciates that the process for securing a loan has been convenient for her. \r\n\r\nHer long-term goals are to have an expanded business and to have her own stall in Baras Market where she can execute orders for her customers, and to invest in her home. She hopes to buy a new tricycle in the future for added income for her family. A tricycle is a motorcycle with sidecar attached used as a public utility vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":629908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is 43 years old, married and has two adult children. He is from the village of Buyon, Cauayan City, Isabela. Wilfredo has been in his business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Wilfredo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living conditions and enable him to engage in business activities. He is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This will be his first loan from ASKI. He plans to use additional income to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nWilfredo is the leader of a six member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is full of challenges and that is what makes people stronger and fonder. Like other woman, 38-year-old Jocelyn C. encounters many challenges in life brought about by poverty. Jocelyn is from Malabor, Tibiao, Antique, Philippines. She is married to Rene C., a fish vendor, and they have five children. Their eldest child is already 17 years old while the youngest is 7 years old. All of the children are still studying.\r\n\r\nThis family earns a living by buying and selling fish. They earn a small amount from the business, but sometimes their income is not enough to meet their basic needs because they do not have enough capital. Therefore, Jocelyn decided to join ASHI and borrow capital. She continued their business with capital of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nJocelyn is always inspired to improve the business because the children are studying. The support of her husband is always there. For her second loan from ASHI, she applied for 10,000 PHP and this will be used as additional capital for fish vending. Her greatest dream in life is to brighten the future of her children by sending them to school until they get a professional degree. She also wants to build a concrete house someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":629929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish
