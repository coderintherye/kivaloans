The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He is a livestock breeder. He has been doing this for the past 6 years and considers it very profitable. Khairullo takes his livestock to the pastures every morning for their nourishment. Then, after caring for them for several months, he takes them to be sold. But this phase is complicated due to transportation issues. Because he does not own his own vehicle, he must work within the schedules and prices that are offered to him. He also sporadically ventures into agriculture, but he does not do this full-time because he believes that times have changed considerably and it is no longer a satisfactory occupation. <p>\r\nKhairullo\u2019s two children are his reason for continuing his efforts as a livestock breeder and farmer. Currently he needs a loan of 3,500 somoni to expand his business. Your support can help improve the quality of life for Khairullo and his family and help their business grow and prosper. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 30; is married; and is the father of 3 children who are 9, 7, and 7 months.  The oldest 2 go to school.  He finished studying only through 5th grade due to his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and doesn't support anyone besides them.  He left Manjacaze for Boane by himself 7 years ago in search of better living conditions.  He has his own business.  He doesn't have any employees and sells kitchen supplies.  He manages to save around 600 meticais a month in his bank account after paying all of his home's expenses.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his friends.  This is his 3rd loan, and it is for 12,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy products for his business (pots and pans, thermoses, kitchen supplies, etc.) to respond to market demand.  His previous loans were for 10,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais, and both were used for the same purpose.  In the future, he hopes to request more loans to be able to expand his home so he can provide better living conditions for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

She will use it to buy chicks and feed to increase her quantity of chickens and respond to the demand for her product during the holiday season that is approaching.  She promises to pay back this credit on time so she will be able to receive more loans.  In the future, she hopes to buy vehicle that will help her transport her merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":396.18,"image":{"id":433106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To raise chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T02:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.82,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":551.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":566.9},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":583.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":599.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":617.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":635.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":653.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":672.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":691.4},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":711.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":731.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":752.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":774.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":796.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":819.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":843.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.04},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.49,"local_amount":1278.49,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709073,"comment":null},{"amount":89.25,"local_amount":2454.3,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2614.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938192,"comment":null},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":1312.21,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1397.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938193,"comment":null},{"amount":48.01,"local_amount":1322.61,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1408.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":128972059,"comment":null},{"amount":100.65,"local_amount":2767.98,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-25T07:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2948.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916086,"comment":null},{"amount":64.06,"local_amount":1864.41,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.74,"payment_id":159878513,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T03:55:37Z","paid_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":155888,"name":"Kabagyenda 6 Kiteteyi Jovilate Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

This is his fourth loan, in the amount of 11,000 MZN. He plans to buy construction materials (rebar, cement, sand and other) to finish building his house. The previous loans were in the amounts of 8900 MZN, 13,000 MZN, and 15,000 MZN, all for the same work. He would like to request additional loans in the future to finish his house, purchase furniture, and finish his higher education. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David

He is 33; married; and the father of 6 children who are 15, 12, 9, 6, 4, and 2.  Of these, 4 of them are in school.  He only studied through 5th grade and didn't continue due to his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home in Boane with his family and supports his mother by sending her money.  He left Boane for Swaziland to look for a job.  After facing several difficulties, he decided to return to Mozambique 2 years later.  He currently has some farmland and has 4 workers.  He grows and sells vegetables (green beans and cabbage) along with his wife.  He has done this activity since 2002 and makes about 45,000 meticais a quarter and saves some in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through neighbors who are also clients of the same institution.  This is his 4th loan and it is for 30,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy supplies and to pay his workers to produce vegetables (potatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc) as a way to satisfy his customers.  His previous loans were for 12,000, 16,000, and 20,000 meticais, and they were all used for the same purpose.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to be able to increase his farmland and introduce new crops.  This is why he promises to pay back his loan on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

He is 40, married, and the father of 2 children who are 12 and 6.  Both of them go to school.  He has a bachelor's degree in agricultural engineering, which he received in Holland.  He lives in his own home with his family, and he supports his 2 brothers and their children by sending them some money.  He left Inharrime for Maputo in 1988 to continue his studies.  After he finished studying at the Agrarian Institute in Boane, he traveled to Holland where he got his bachelor's degree.  He has worked as an agricultural technician for 17 years.  He works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and makes a monthly wage of 12,530 meticais.  He saves some of it in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his friend who is also a client of the institution.  This is his 5th loan, and it is for 26,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construction materials (cement, iron, and to pay for labor) to continue building his home.  His previous loans were for 16,000, 15,000, 25,000, and 40,000 meticais.  All of them were used for the same purpose.  His goal is to finish his home so he can offer better living conditions to his family.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to build a commercial establishment and to start a small farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

He lives in the Gicumbi district in the northern province of Rwanda which is approximately an one hour's drive from Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Jean Bosco has been a butcher for 13 years.  His immaculately clean shop provides the community with quality meat products at fair prices. His business hours are from 7 AM to 4 PM every day except Sunday. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Jean Bosco's second loan - he paid back on time and in full his first loan from VFC.

This, Ildephonse explains, will satisfy their customers, increase their sales and result in more profits \u2013 all good things!\r\n\r\nAny additional profits from this loan, the members of this group will reinvest in their business in order to build more secure futures for their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":431204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more beverages (sodas and beer) for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Byumba \/Gicumbi \/Rwanda","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francois","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Therese ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anastasie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ildephonse","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ildephonse","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jean De Dieu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jean Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jean De Dieu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epiphanie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":790000,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":131666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":131666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":131666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":131666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":131666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":131666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":131666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":132043.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782267,"comment":null},{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":131666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":132043.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169369,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":131666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":132043.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008360,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":131666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":132043.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037590,"comment":null},{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":131683.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":132060.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760259,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":131650,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":132026.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022693,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-19T17:01:50Z","paid_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":155909,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha sells fairly used clothing at market in the city of Warri, Nigeria.

She is 42, single, and the mother of 2 children who are 15 and 12.  They both go to school.  She never went to school.  She lost her parents very early and never had anyone to support her.  She lives in her own home with her children and her nephew who lost his parents.  She moved from Matola to Boane over 10 years ago because she had obtained a space to build her home.  She currently is a merchant and has owned her own business for 12 years.  She doesn't have employees and her children always help her when she needs it.  She sells used clothing and earns between 1,000 and 2,000 meticais a day.  She saves money through a traditional rotating savings system known as Xitique.  She has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku because it is near the bank where she works.  This is her 7th loan and it is for 25,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy bundles of used clothing to diversify her products even more and satisfy the market.  Her previous loans were for 3,200, 5,000, 5,000, 8,000, 15,500, and 20,000 meticais and were all used for the same activity.  In the future, she would like to finish building her home and to request more loans to pipe water to her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

He is 44, married, and the father of 2 children who are 17 and 12.  Both of them go to school.  He only studied through the 1st grade and didn't continue because he lost his parents very early.  He lives in his own home and supports one nephew who lost his mother.  He left Manhi\u00e7a for the district of Boane in 1969 because he changed jobs.  He previously decided to build his home and to start a family in Boasne.  He has had his own business for 19 years.  He sells basic goods from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. with the help of his wife.  He manages to make around 1,000 meticais a day and saves some every month in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another financial institution.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his neighbor who also is a client of the institution.  This is his third loan and it is for 25,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy basic goods for his business (sugar, margarine, rice, etc.).  His previous credits were for 10,000 and 15,000 meticais, which were both used for the same purpose.  In the future, he hopes to request more credits to be able to expand the growing area of his small farm and to reinforce his products for his business to respond to his customers' demand.<br

He is 45, is married, and has one son who is 14.  After he finished primary school, he completed two military terms.  He only studied through the 7th grade and stopped when he was drafted for obligatory military service.  He lives in his own home with his family and doesn't support anyone else besides them.  He left Sofala for the province of Tete when he was in the military in 1980.  He later left Tete for Maputo because of a transfer to the Ministry of Defense.  After he left the military, he decided to continue working for the Ministry of Defense.  He has worked as an administrator for the state major general for more than 15 years and works 8 hours a day.  He has a monthly salary of 11,346.80 meticais and saves some in a commercial bank called Millennium Bim.  He has never requested a loan from another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through a credit official from the Catembe branch (Z\u00e9lia Massinga).  This is his 4th loan and it is for 20,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construction materials (cement, iron, locks, paint, etc.) to finish building his home.  His previous loans were for 8,000, 10,000, and 20,000 meticais and were all used for the same activity.  In the future, he would like to request more loans to start building another home outside the district of Boane to guarantee his future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":699.85,"image":{"id":433148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of construction materials (locks, cement, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T03:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.15,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caetano Joaquim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":908.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":945.71},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":984.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1067.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1156.68},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1204.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1253.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1305.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1358.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1414.71},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1472.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1533.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1596.39},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1662.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.79},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.48},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":98.53,"local_amount":2815.07,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2885.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709079,"comment":null},{"amount":206.31,"local_amount":5894.51,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6042.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938203,"comment":null},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":0.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":0.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938204,"comment":null},{"amount":100.14,"local_amount":2865.46,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-20T07:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2937.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.15,"payment_id":128972064,"comment":null},{"amount":112.81,"local_amount":3223.03,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3304.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698642,"comment":null},{"amount":182.05,"local_amount":5201.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5332.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916092,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T23:50:35Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":155921,"name":"Reyna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia REYNA pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMERCAMUEBLE\u201d y vive en la ciudad Imperial del Cusco. \n\nLa socia tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente, tiene dos hijos dos varones.

This business privides him the reliable income that he needs to provide for his family.  He also has been working in agriculture since he was fifteen.  Normally, he plants sugar cane, onions, chili, and peppers in the small plot of land that he inherited from his parents.  With the income from these businesses, Frank provides for his family and helps them prosper.\r\n\r\nThe continual use of his moto-taxi has made it start to break down, and it requires urgent maintenance.  This is why Frank is soliciting his first Edpyme Alternativa loan of 1,000 new soles to provide his vehicle with the necessary maintenance and equipment.\r\n\r\nHis greatest wish is to continue farming and to save to buy himself a car to work as a taxi driver when he is not at home farming.  He would also like to expand his home to make it more comfortable for his family.

She is requesting a loan because she wants to take advantage of the fact that in these past months she has been able to purchase greater quantities since people are buying a lot of corn and sodas. She travels weekly to the capital to buy corn, sugar and eggs; the sodas she can buy from a delivery truck. She wants to fix a room to better arrange what she sells, but she will do this later as she prefers to invest all her capital in the purchase of more goods.

She makes lunches to sell in the \u201cZona Franca\u201d (a governmental organization that regulates exportation from Nicaragua).  She sells food for cash and for credit with weekly payments.  \r\n\r\nShe started her sales with funds that her husband gave her and the support of a friend.  She was able to start selling clothes and shoes, and she had customer orders.  But, sales in the last few months have been bad.  She did not get income, and she had clothes that she did not sell.  That is how the need to sell food emerged.  Every day she sells more.\r\n\r\nThat is why she turns to a loan.  She does not have sufficient capital to make the food.  She will buy meat, rice, beans, dairy products, and fruit to prepare the food and drinks.  \r\n\r\nShe gets up very early to make the different meals.  Her mother helps her.  She has to be en route to transport and deliver the lunch at the exact time.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy more plates, cups, and spoons among other things.  Now that her food sales have increased, she will also start to buy clothes.  In the Christmas month her customers order clothes for their children, which she gives them credit to buy with the ease of making several payments.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Afodenic for their help in improving her business.  She expects to soon be saving for her own house, which is one of her dreams.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":433276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Buy more cups, plates, and spoons for her food and to buy various seasonal clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-23T20:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenia Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.32,"local_amount":1026.39,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1063.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601798,"comment":null},{"amount":50.27,"local_amount":1005.48,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1041.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003247,"comment":null},{"amount":48.41,"local_amount":968.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841404,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874319,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604211,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639677,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T02:10:26Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":155990,"name":"Walter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Walter L. is 29 years old and married to Nancy Castillo.

Thanks to small loans from institutions and help from her husband, she was able to make her business more solid.  Her husband is a bookkeeper with a private business.  She has three children who go to school to have a better future.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh cycle with Afodenic.  She will buy basic grains like beans, rice, sugar, oil, oats, dairy products, meat, and other things to improve sales.  In the last few months she has not sold enough, and her earnings are low.  That is why she needs the investment so that she does not fail in her sales.  She will keep increasing her various products. In the future, she wishes to improve her store by putting down a tile floor.  The one she has is dirt, and she wishes to give a better, more hygienic service to her customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

M. is 54 years old.  She started her business twenty years ago when her mother gave her a small pig that she fattened, butchered, and sold for the meat.  With her earnings she bought a larger pig and started her business as a result.  Now she sells <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chicharr%C3%B3n\" target=\"_blank\" >chicharrones<\/a>, pork, and chorizo sausage.  She also makes <i>chuchitos<\/i> (cornmeal dumplings with a meat filling, similar to <i>tamales<\/i>).  Her customers know her well and come to her house to buy these products.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting this loan so that she can take advantages of these months for buying more pigs.  She has enough orders for meat products and needs sufficient capital to acquire these animals, which can cost between 1200 to 1500 GTQ each.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Zoila has eight children, but only two of her daughters are single and still live with her.  They are learning the business while helping their mother.  Zoila says she is happy to teach them a trade that can help them in the future.  She wants to invest her capital well so that she can save some of her earnings and build up some nice equity over time.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

of the Bella Maria (\"Beautiful Maria\") Group. \n\nFor a long time Mrs Segunda worked with her husband making brooms.  Because of their lack of experience, the business failed.  Although it was very sad, they didn\u2019t lose their enthusiasm and started another business selling cleaning products.  It wasn\u2019t easy to start this business because they had to overcome many obstacles including finding customers.  It was difficult to become known, but despite these problems they succeeded and today  feel very proud and happy to see the success of their business.\n\nMrs. Segunda labels, wraps and sells the cleaning products.  It\u2019s amazing to realize that they have been working for 30 years in this business and have been able to educate their children.  One of them is a teacher and another will become a chef.  This fills them with happiness. They have also been able to finish the first floor of their house. In the near future they are looking at the possibility of opening a store in their house so that they can sell the products directly to the public.

The effort of this group can been seen through their accomplishments and, likewise, they are very responsible and have known how to invest the loans provided by the ASDIR Association well. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":433358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To launch businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Suchitep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2009-11-23T23:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wendy Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-26T09:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110638748,"comment":null},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T09:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1173.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118035472,"comment":null},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123873639,"comment":null},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128906836,"comment":null},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1173.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136634434,"comment":null},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":1166.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1172.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144668902,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T01:33:31Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156036,"name":"Bricy Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nBricy es una madre de familia de 29 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposo y sus dos hijos en el distrito de Paij\u00e1n, provincia de Ascope, en la regi\u00f3n La Libertad, ubicado a 3 horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nDesde hace m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o tiene una tienda que funciona en la casa donde vive actualmente.

She lives with her husband and two sons in the Paij\u00e1n District, Province of Ascope, in the La Libertad Region which is situated three hours from the city of Chiclayo.  For more than a year she has had a store which she runs in the house where she currently lives.  She tells us that the idea for her business came from her mother-in-law and from the need to have a permanent source of income in order to meet the household expenses, since her husband works as a day laborer and also drives mototaxis (motor vehicles which are used to transport goods and passengers).\r\nShe provides groceries, beverages and produce to her neighbors who patronize her establishment in order to obtain her products since the market is located some distance from the area where they live.  The regular customers who frequent her business have got Bricy thinking about expanding it by purchasing more beverages.  That's why she is approaching Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 1,000 New Sols.  Bricy is an enterprising mother who is responsible and very hardworking.  Her greatest wish is to be able to expand her business, to have a decent house and to provide her children with a quality education.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":433367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more beverages to expand her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan - Ascope - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T00:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bricy Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":68.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":72.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":78.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":81.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":92.6},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":95.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":97.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.08},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.08,"local_amount":68.81,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":69.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669658,"comment":null},{"amount":25.24,"local_amount":72.11,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":72.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065159,"comment":null},{"amount":25.08,"local_amount":71.64,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:12Z","rounded_local_amount":72.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900261,"comment":null},{"amount":27.46,"local_amount":78.46,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":79.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934413,"comment":null},{"amount":248.14,"local_amount":708.98,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":714.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662031,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T06:39:21Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156037,"name":"Renovacion Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ALEJANDRINA H.

However, when the owners found out about her condition, they couldn't keep her in the job.  And so with very little money, she invested in the purchase of sweets and sold them while walking up and down various streets.  Currently she helps in a restaurant that is located in the market, which generates another income for her.  With her work she has been able to give her daughter an education; she studies in a private school.

Now her daughter-in-law helps her sell the stuffed animals and clothes she brings from Lima, .  She also helps her brother, who has a sweater factory.

With the Christmas festivities there will be a lot of sales, and she is sure that it will go very well.\r\n\r\n*Hilaria appears smiling in the middle of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":433365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes Heroina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel Antony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elidema Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arturo Flavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Victor Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hipolito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9300,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":812.5,"local_amount":2325,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2340,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669110,"comment":null},{"amount":813.2,"local_amount":2327,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2342.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064572,"comment":null},{"amount":811.8,"local_amount":2323,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899632,"comment":null},{"amount":812.5,"local_amount":2325,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2340,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933715,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T04:12:32Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156039,"name":"Genesis 1, 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucrecia is the coordinator of her group, Genesis, and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti) clients generally.

She rents a room for all of this with the purpose of getting ahead and being able to cover her expenses and those of her family, since everything is very expensive.  When she started she did so with the help of her husband, who sells basic grains.  She has three children, two of whom are married and one who studies at the university.  With her income she pays for the light, water, and educational expenses, as well as a variety of goods to increase her sales.  She is 51 years old, and lives in the Villa Reconciliacion where she has managed to have a good clientele for her dressmaking business.  With this loan she will buy pants for women and men, clothing for children, shoes, fabric, thread, trimmings and other items to fulfill her orders and increase her variety of clothing.

For this reason, he works hard in his fields planting potatoes, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulluco<\/a>, peas, corn, and barley with the help of his wife.  His hope is for his daughter to pursue art and painting at an institute located 5 hours from their hometown by car.  He enjoys farming, but says he experiences difficulties when the area encounters frost (thereby freezing his crops) because he is not able to save his harvest.  On other occasions, if there is too much rain, his crops will rot.  Despite these difficulties, Marcos refuses to give up farming since he has done this since childhood and knows no other way of life.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his 12th loan with MFP.

Ya que en tiempo de invierno sus ventas son bajas por que se moja y su comida no la saca a fuera lo cual es muy preocupante para ella ya que tiene que pagar los gastos b\u00e1sicos de agua, luz, la alimentaci\u00f3n. Es  por eso pondr\u00e1 un techo de zinc para poder vender en todo tiempo y poder sastifacer las necesidades personales como poder cumplir con el pago mensual del financiamiento.","en":"Sra. Ruth has been selling prepared meals and fried snacks for six years.  She started this business because she needed to support her three children as a single mother.  Ruth is 46 years old and lives in the neighborhood of Laurles Norte.  Two of her wishes are to provide for her children\u2019s education and have better working conditions.  Currently the area of her home where she sells her products does not have a roof.  She wants to buy sheets of zinc and metal crossbeams so that her business is more presentable to her customers, and thereby allows her to provide better service.  \r\n<p>\r\nSales are lower during the winter because of the rainy season.  Ruth has no other place to conduct business and she is worried because she still has to pay her water, electricity, and food bills.  Installing a roof will enable her to continue selling food throughout the year so that she can generate income to cover both her personal necessities and her monthly loan payments.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":433468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase materials to install a roof over her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T21:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth Belina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":1872.26,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1875.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601886,"comment":null},{"amount":77.52,"local_amount":1603.95,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003252,"comment":null},{"amount":167.18,"local_amount":3458.94,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3465.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874324,"comment":null},{"amount":76.69,"local_amount":1586.6,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1589.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604216,"comment":null},{"amount":81.12,"local_amount":1678.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1681.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821457,"comment":null},{"amount":162.74,"local_amount":3367.09,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3373.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561468,"comment":null},{"amount":69.26,"local_amount":1432.78,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1435.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770423,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T21:59:53Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156078,"name":"Aristides Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aristides Antonio es casado, tiene 2 hijos, el mayor de  14 a\u00f1os de edad y el ni\u00f1o menor de siete a\u00f1itos de edad,est\u00e1 solicitando  su 6to  refinanciamiento  para invertirlo en mejora de su vivienda (Construcci\u00f3n de una habitaci\u00f3n), trabaja como Guarda de Seguridad en el INTA de Nueva Guinea desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, este cliente se ha destacado por ser responsable, honesto, trabajador, su esposa es comerciante en su pulperia bien surtida la cual la ayuda con los gastos familiares ya que son una familia pobre pero unida, viven en un barrio donde cada d\u00eda se va aumentando la poblaci\u00f3n, su sue\u00f1o es ir mejorando la vivienda con cada cr\u00e9dito que estos van adquiriendo con AFODENIC,  tener estabilidad laboral, salud y que su hijos sigan estudiando para que lleguen hacer alguien en la vida.","en":"Aristides Antonio is married with two children.

At the beginning it was difficult for her to create a clientele and many did not pay her. In order to stabilize she succeeded with a loan from Afodenic. She also invested in buying silver jewelry as it sells well. Her husband is a customs officer and he is very supportive in order to give his children a better education. She is 32 years old, she lives in Villa Libertad. It is her plan to buy clothes for ladies, gentlemen, and children as well as many pieces of silver jewelry to meet her orders.

Her two older children are twins who are currently in their fourth year of high school.  \r\n<p>\r\nDelfina works for MINED (the Ministry of Education) as an elementary school teacher in the Serrano neighborhood.  She has been teaching for four years and her school is located 28km away from the city.  At the moment, she is requesting her ninth loan to invest in home improvements (specifically the construction of a room).  Every day, Delfina wakes up at 4am to complete her household chores before catching a passenger truck at 6am to leave for her teaching job.  Even though he does not live with them, the father of her children is very responsible and contributes toward their expenses.  Delfina hopes that her children continue to study, find work, and remain healthy.  She also wants to improve their living conditions so that they will be more comfortable.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

M. is 44 years old. She lives in Corredores, in the southern region of Costa Rica, with her husband and four children. Maritza is in the textile business: she designs and produces shorts and pants by hand with her sewing machine. She started her business in November of 2006 with an initial investment of 700,000 colons ($1200 US) she sells her products from her home and from door to door in her neighbourhood. Her clothes are very popular, and at the moment she has more orders than she can keep up with. \r\n\r\nMaritza\u2019s main challenge has been securing a reliable and affordable supplier of raw materials. Currently, her supplier is located in San Isidro, which is close to her home, but the materials are expensive and delivery is unreliable. She knows a supplier in San Jose who is much more professional and affordable. Due to the longer distance and associated costs of distribution, the San Jose supplier requires a minimum quantity to be purchased with every order. Currently, she does not have enough capital to place a large enough order to satisfy this restriction. Maritza is applying for a loan of 500,000 colons, which will enable her to purchase larger quantities of materials from the source in San Jose. With your help, she will be able to purchase in bulk and take advantage of a lower price for the materials she needs. By switching suppliers, Maritza will increase her profit margins and use the income to improve her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nMaritza has a strong work ethic; she devotes the hours from 7am to 6pm to her textile business. On a good day she can produce 10 articles of clothing. Shorts sell for 2500 colons (around $4US) while pants sell for 4000 colons (roughly$7US). The majority of sales are done in cash, and in a good month she earns 500,000 colons. In a bad month, she only earns 60,000 colons.  After accounting for the costs of raw materials, rent and machinery maintenance, Maritza uses her revenues to support her family.\r\n\r\nMaritza dreams of opening her own store where she could offer a more diverse range of products.\r\n\r\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the improvement of the lives of families living in a poor community of southern Costa Rica.

He learned farming from his parents at a young age.  He works on the farm with the help of the entire family, because the work in this part of the country is done as a team.  This is how he himself learned, and it is a tradition passed on from generation to generation that is still practiced to this day.  Also, all the farmers know that this is the way to advance quicker.\r\n\r\nConcurrently to planting his crops, Aniceto also raises sheep that he then sells in the nearby markets.  He considers agriculture to be a profitable endeavor, because is has allowed him to sustain his family and improve their standard of living.  It also gave him the opportunity to build a house, which is why he continues to work on a daily basis.  He wants to give the best of himself, and he will accomplish this by continuing to work hard and meeting his goals.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to expand his livestock, which is why he requests a loan to invest in vitamins for these animals so they grow healthy.  He would also like to buy fertilizers and insecticides for his farmlands, so he can achieve a successful harvest.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP, and he has always been considered an honest man who complies with his installment payments.  He is also satisfied with his cooperative bank\u2019s work because he has known all the members for quite some time, and knows that they are responsible people.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":433590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer, insecticides, and vitamins for his animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T14:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aniceto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1512,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751222,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T18:52:46Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156121,"name":"Emercita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emercita E. is from the village of Quezon, Bukidnon.

He lives with his wife (Juliana) who is 49 years old, and his two children; Katia is 19 years old, and Alexander is 8.  They are what give him the motivation to forge ahead.\r\n\r\nThis man wakes each and every day anxious to work the land that witnessed his birth, which sustained his ancestors and today continues to yield prosperous crops so that hard-working men like him can care for their families.  The nutrient-rich and prepared land provides Celestino with a delicious potato crop that he harvests and then sells to help support his family.  He enjoys farming, a vocation he learned from his parents.  They didn\u2019t provide him with a career, but gave him the necessary skills and taught him how to work the land.  In addition, he raises sheep to sell in nearby markets.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to plant not only potatoes but also vegetables.

She lives with her 54 year old husband, Florentino, and their three children.  Wilder is 16, Milena is 13, and Susana is 12.\r\n\r\nShe gets up early every morning.  As the birds sing she starts her work of planting potatoes.  She is accompanied by the whole family on the small farm, which is close to her house.  She also raises sheep and pigs.  As she is a hard-worker, she also helps her husband make multicolored weavings.\r\n\r\nGloria is a great businesswoman, and in her own words, \u201cI try to sell what falls in my hands\u201d.  It is very true, because she says that she sells the delicious potatoes that she harvests from her productive earth.  It is also true of her well fed animals and the weavings that she makes day to day with her husband.\r\n\r\nLike all enterprising women, in the future she would like to buy more animals of a better breed and sell them at a greater price.

A. is from the village of Agoho, Mambajao, Camiguin Province. She is 36 years old. Marivic is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Marivic owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling processed food, such as longganisa and peanut butters, in the local community. Marivic has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marivic joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Marivic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. Marivic is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marivic from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Th\u1ecb (8) is a 50-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Mi\u1ec5n is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 02.06.1.2 Nam Ng\u1ea1n.\r\n\r\nMi\u1ec5n is married and has three adult children. To making a living, Mi\u1ec5n operates a family business in the services sector.

Mi\u1ec5n has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mi\u1ec5n joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Mi\u1ec5n has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide services. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND, which will be used to purchase more materials needed to provide services. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Mi\u1ec5n plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.

A. is from the village of San Rogue, Maramag, Bukidnon. She is 27 years old. Jean is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Jean owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling poultry products in the local community. Jean has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jean joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Jean has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. The previous loan was very helpful for her family's daily needs. Jean is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to continue her business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jean from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business and slowly pay off her credits. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":433657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

R. is from the village of Bonbon, Catarman Camiguin Province. She is 23 years old. Shela is single and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, Shela owns & operates a business in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.  The main source of income from the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Shela has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Shela is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Shela from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

is usually hard to raise a big family. Dedication and hard work is required to support all of the needs of the family. But for Teresita S., this problem did not arise because she is lucky that her husband Alberto strives hard to provide for their family in spite of his low income as a farmer.\r\nTeresita is now 51 years old with 11 children who range in age from 10 to 32 years old. Most of the younger ones are still in school but the older children are already working and helping to support the family. This family of 13 lives in the village of Bi-ao, in the town of Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.\r\nTo help her husband support their family, Teresita started with pig fattening and raising chickens, selling the chickens in the local market after raising them for 45 days. This venture became a family affair as the younger kids were able to help with the chores of feeding the animals and cleaning their pens, which were all located in the backyard of their house.\r\nSeeing that she could earn a respectable income from such an activity, Teresita wanted to expand her pig fattening and chicken operations but she needed additional capital to buy the piglets and the chicks. This is the reason why she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000. \r\nWith access to additional funds, she was able to increase the number of animals and was also able to start a general store adjacent to their house. Now her lowest monthly profit is 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from these business activities. This has a big impact in defraying their household expenses and has enabled her to set aside some money for the higher education of her children. They have also been able to buy a small sugarcane farm that her husband now manages.\r\nHer previous loan of PHP29,500 was used as additional capital for her business activities and now that she has paid that off, she is borrowing the same amount of PHP29,500, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store, feed for her piggery, and fertilizer for their sugarcane farm. She hopes to use the profits to make improvements to their household.  \r\n\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":434874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional capital for her general store and other businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T05:10:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29500,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":9077,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9391.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849028,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6807.61,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":7043.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739696,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":9076.92,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9391.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129116,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4538.47,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4695.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965912,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-28T01:41:14Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156160,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana S. is from the village of San Roque, Maramag, Bukidnon.

A. is from the village of Benoni, Mahinog, Camiguin Province.

The main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elizabeth joined HSPFI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Elizabeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

B. is from the village of Lagunde, which is within the Mambajao Camiguin Province of the Philippines.

To earn a living, Elizabeth owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector; more specifically, she runs a sari-sari (variety) retail store.  Her main source of income is derived from selling a variety of different products to her local community members.  Elizabeth explains that she has been engaged in this business for over four years, and that she typically earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elizabeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services; as a result, she was able to engage in business activities, and, in turn, to improve her family's standard of living.  Elizabeth is requesting a loan in the amount of 5,000 PHP ($125), which will be used to purchase additional products for resale purposes.  This loan would be the first loan taken out by Elizabeth from HSPFI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to supplement her family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI: HSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

M. lives in Palao1, Brgy. Balintawak, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She is 60 years old and married to Hermigeldo M., who is a fisherman. The couple have 15 children who range in age from 13 to 42 years old. The older children already have their own families and live separately from their parents, while the single adult kids who still live at home help with the family expenses. Most of the younger children still go to school.\r\n\r\nFedencia herself could not believe that she could raise 15 children, but she said that they did all this with God\u2019s help and their own tireless efforts, patience, perseverance and most of all, love. Now, even at 60, she continues her business pursuits in the hope that she can provide a good future for her younger children.\r\n\r\nWhen they first started life together, Fedencia was well aware that her husband had no fixed income and that their livelihood solely relied on the fish he caught each day. As their family grew, Fedencia realized that she had to contribute to the family income, so she started a small general store adjacent to their house. Her business helped a lot in defraying their household costs, which was why Fedencia thought of expanding her operations so that she could increase her income potential. The need for additional capital moved her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon, a Kiva partner,  in 2005.\r\n\r\nThe additional capital allowed her to earn more than her previous income and the store now earns a minimum monthly income of 2,000 Philippine pesos. Also, with the additional income, she was able to raise livestock, which she sold for additional profits. \r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed PHP 18,000 to purchase additional stock for her general store. This time around, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 for her seventh loan cycle with NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she can consistently purchase new stock when her store\u2019s inventory is depleted. She is determined that, while she is able, she will continue working until all of her children are either gainfully employed or established in their own livelihoods.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":423582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

P., 54 years old, is from the village of Sto.Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran Zamboanga Del Sur.

While not the only means for generating revenue, she has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Clemencia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clemencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide services. Clemencia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand her business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Clemencia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a 52-year-old widow with five children.  Her children are between the ages of 14 and 22 years old, and all of her children are currently attending school.  She resides in and owns a four-room house, where she lives with six people.  Teopista also takes care of additional family members. Thankfully, her family has access to electricity and piped water, and they are able to eat three meals per day.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, she operates a poultry business.  Teopista works seven days per week in a semi-urban area (in the outskirts of Kampala), and she averages approximately 20 customers per day.  She explains that she sells to all categories of customers (i.e., retail and wholesale customers), and that she incurs transportation costs when buying chicken feed and feeding trays.  Her major business challenges are the ever-increasing prices of chicken feed and chickens in Uganda.  She has been in this business for over 20 years, and she has been with MCDT for eight years.  Notably, this would be Teopista's twentieth loan via MCDT.  Teopista joined MCDT because it was near her home, and because it was an easy organization to work with.  She would like to use this loan to buy more sacks of chicken feed and chickens.  She aspires to own 5,000 chickens someday.\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":433804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She receives an average of 20 customers a day and sells to all categories of people in retail and wholesale. She has a restaurant in Owino Market and sells all types of food plus tea. Her major business challenge is ever increasing prices of food due to famine in many villages of Uganda. She has been in this business for over ten years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her fifteenth loan. Aisha joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was easy to work with. She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas, cassava, and sweet potatoes.

He was born into a farm family. He is a married man and has one son, Minggas S., who is 9 years old and studying in the first grade of elementary school. Frans lives with his family in Nenas Village, Fatumnasi Sub district, Kapan \u2013 South Central Region of Timor. Nenas lives far away from downtown. It takes about two and a half hours to travel from the Kapan Branch Office. Even though categorized as a cloistered place, Nenas Village is surrounded with a beautiful view. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet his family's needs, Frans has to work hard by cultivating carrots, leeks and vegetables. The traders from Kupang city usually come to buy his agricultural products, so he doesn\u2019t have to sell them at the market. The income that he generates from selling agricultural products helps him to meet his family's needs and Minggas\u2019 educational needs, such as his uniform and books. \r\n\r\nFrans usually works on the farm from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. Frans faces challenges in farming. He has to fetch water from a well by using two buckets and then carrying them on his shoulders. Actually, there is a fresh water facility available in the village. It is provided by a Non-Government Institution in West Timor, but not all of the community members, including Frans, can access the fresh water facility because their houses are situated far from the main street. This is the reason why he has to fetch water from the well. Even though he has to walk for about four kilometers from his farm to fetch the water, Frans never complains. He is happy to do his work.\r\n\r\nFrans and family live in a very simple house that is constructed of thatch (also called water reeds or roof reeds), It is called a \u2018round house\u2019 \u2013 this is a type of traditional house in the South Central Region of Timor). There is only one room available in this house for cooking and sleeping. Frans plans to build a better house for his family, but he cannot afford it as he is only a poor farmer. His income is only enough to meet their daily needs and his son\u2019s educational needs. \r\n\r\nFrans heard from the clergyman in the village that the Kiva field partner, the Tanaoba Lais Manekat Foundation, provides cattle loans for farmers in West Timor through the Cattle Fattening Program. Many farmers have felt the benefits of this program. Frans discussed it with his neighbors and they decided to form a group of ten farmers to join the Cattle Fattening Program. The group was named Nasaret A1. He is interested in joining the program because he wants to build a house for his family. He believes that through this program he will be able to generate profits that can help him buy the necessary building materials. Frans is requesting a loan amounting to 3,400,000 IDR from TLM to buy young cattle to fatten in twelve months. The other group members are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle. They hope to have a better life through this loan.\r\n\r\nNote: When the group picture was taken, Jermias was not present."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":433892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Nenas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T18:40:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yulius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marteda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Markus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melkior","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jermias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Apris","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfonsus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":33500000,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1769.7,"local_amount":16700000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":16705982.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195922614,"comment":null},{"amount":1780.3,"local_amount":16800000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":16806017.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211305063,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T15:24:31Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:04:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156266,"name":"Srey Mom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srey Mom H. is the mother of four children.

He is grateful that he has his own fertile land that can be utilized as a farm. Leon plants carrots, corns, bananas, cassavas and king grass.

Nenas is situated about 74 km from the capital city of the South Central Region of Timor. Most of the community in Nenas supports their family life by farming.\r\n\r\nNasaret A3 Group is led by Martha N., a 35-year-old woman. Martha is married to a 54-year-old man who works as a teacher at an elementary school. Their marriage has been blessed with four children. They are: David P., 17, who is in Senior High School Grade 3; Daniman P., 14, who attends Junior High School Grade 3; Oma, 7, who is in Elementary School Grade 2; and Salomo, 5, who is not at school yet\r\n\r\nMartha and her family live in a small house with two bedrooms. The kitchen was built separately from the main house \u2013 people in Timor usually call it a \u2018round house\u2019 (this is a type of traditional house in Timor). It is constructed with reeds, roof, and a dirt floor. Many of the community in the rural areas of the South Central Region of Timor have this type of traditional house. Generally, they use it as a kitchen and a place to sleep when the weather is cold. \r\n\r\nMartha usually starts her activities at 5 am. She looks after the children and prepares breakfast for them before they go to school. She also prepares  breakfast for her husband before he goes to work. After she completes her work at the house, Martha will go to the farm to cultivate her crops. She plants carrots, leeks and other vegetables. She usually spends about four hours at the farm. The challenge that Martha faces as a farmer is the availability of a water supply for her farm. The spring is situated about 2 km from the farm, so she has to walk that far to get the water. Her husband usually helps her in cultivating the farm after work. \r\n\r\nLiving as a farmer with four children is not easy for Martha. Even though her husband is working as an elementary school teacher, the income generated is only enough to meet their daily needs. This is the reason why Martha is interested in joining the cattle fattening program. She wants to save money to send her son to study at the university. She also hopes to renovate her house. \r\n\r\nMartha and her group are requesting a loan to buy young cattle to fatten over a 12 month period.

He lives in Gicumbi in the Northern Province of Rwanda, a one-hour drive from Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Felex is a hard working man and now he has become the president of a group called Twisungane.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are well-known in their community and their restaurant business is a popular place for locals to hang out. This is their fourth successful year of operation! The hours of their restaurant require that they start early in the morning and work until late in the night every day of the week, oftentimes until the food runs out or the last customer is fed. They employ four people as helpers.\r\n\r\nFelex and his group members have been in business since 2006 and they are ready to expand, but their operating profit is still too low for them to make some key purchases to enable the expansion.

M. is a 41-year-old married woman who lives in Purok Paraiso, Baranggay 2, Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. Her husband, Emmanuel, is a small sugar farmer. They have three young children who are between 4 and 9 years old. The older kids are presently attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nMerlita works hard to help her husband provide for their children\u2019s future because she does not want them to go through the same hardships she had while she was growing: needing to have a paying job just to help her parents support their family. Her most cherished dream is for her children to finish their studies and get a stable job or have an established livelihood.\r\n\r\nMerlita met her husband in Manila many years ago when she worked as a factory worker just to help her parents support their family. When they got married, they decided to go home to Negros where Emmanuel had a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) farmland that he could plant with sugarcane. Merlita had to adjust to living in a new place and she also realized that she needed to have her own source of income so that she could help her husband support their family.\r\n\r\nWhen Merlita gave birth to their oldest child, she decided to put up a general store adjacent to their house. She thought that this would serve two purposes: she could take care of her child and their household while selling basic goods to her neighbors and earn a supplemental income for their family. But in spite of her best efforts, she could not sustain the required inventory level that was needed and she sometimes did not have enough stock to sell. She almost decided to close down her store.\r\n\r\nIt was serendipity that a friend introduced Merlita to NWTF-Project Dungganon, and when she became a member in 2002, she was able to access the much-needed capital to support the capital requirements of her store. She was even able to expand her product offerings.\r\n\r\nAs her business grew, Merlita started selling rice to her neighbors, and also raised pigs in her backyard. Now she earns a minimum of PHP 10,000 per month from her business activities. She is currently saving money for the education of her children and also so that she can buy a motorcycle which they will use as another source of income.\r\n\r\nMerlita\u2019s previous loan of PHP 22,500 was utilized as revolving working capital for her businesses. Having paid that in due course, Merlita is borrowing PHP 25,000 this time around so that she can continue sustaining the capital requirements of her businesses. She hopes that all her efforts will bear fruit in the fulfillment of all her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":433721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use as

Arvin is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the fourth loan that Arvin has taken out from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated by the loan to improve and expand his business.. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Avazjon is originally from the region of Spitamen and for several years has dedicated himself to cattle breeding. He has attended to this work with great effort in order to maintain his home. Avazjon is married with two little children and has the duty of supporting his family. For this reason he has decided to come to IMON International for help in buying young cattle. It is his dream to develop his business with more loans and in this way continue to maintain his humble home. Avazjon promises to repay this loan in a timely manner and thanks all KIVA lenders for trusting and supporting him. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Lorlina has a live-in partner named Marcial who also helps her in her business. They live in Brgy. Libacao, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nLorlina and Marcial have a simple dream \u2013 for her youngest child to finish college, have electricity connected to their house, buy their own incubator for their balut business (balut is fertilized duck egg with a nearly developed embryo that is boiled and eaten in the shell), and be able to buy a tricycle (a motorcycle with side car) to deliver their products. If she accomplishes these goals, she knows that their living conditions will surely improve.\r\n\r\nEven before she started her business, she thought of what to do to help improve and make life easy for her family. She decided that selling street food like boiled peanut and balut. They developed a daily routine of buying raw balut and peanuts in the morning and cooking fresh batches daily and going around the town streets to sell their products. It was hard work but it earned a living for their family, so Lorlina persevered.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Lorlina saw the opportunity to expand her business and joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the capital necessary to increase her sales volume. This turned out to be a good decision and she was finally able to set up a permanent place to display her products.  Now instead of operating a roving business, she can let her customers come to her in the same place every day. \r\n\r\nLorlina earns a net profit of about 10,000 Philippine pesos (about $213 US) or sometimes more per month. At present, she is setting aside a portion for her \u201cmotorcycle fund\u201d and for the education of her youngest child.  Her previous loan of 15,000 pesos was used as revolving capital for her balut and peanut business. \r\n\r\nNow she is borrowing, for her 11th loan cycle, the amount of 18,000 pesos.  This loan will be used both as revolving working capital for her balut and peanut business and to buy piglets to raise and sell for a profit when they are fully grown. Some part of the income from this will be added to her motorcycle fund until she could buy her dream motorcycle for her deliveries, and the rest will be for the education and support of their family. \r\n\r\nWhen she has bought her motorcycle, Lorlina intends to start saving up for her incubator so that she can make the balut herself and increase her profit margin.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":433633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Additional capital

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Dadajon is a 35-year-old married man who lives with his three children and owns a small farm. He lives and works in a small village in the Northern part of Tajikistan in Djabbar Rasulov region. Dadajon, together with his wife (pictured), have been running a business raising and selling cattle. He has 11 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Dadajon has become a very successful businessman in a very short period. The income is enough to cover family needs but as his children grow, covering family needs has become harder. So Dadajon applied for a loan to expand his activities and to purchase more cattle. With your help, Dadajon can get ahead. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
