Thi Houng, #09010010, is 32 yrs old and lives with her husband and 2 young children. Her family has many business activities for their income: raising chickens for eggs, ducks for meat, sows for breeding and meat, selling construction materials. In addition to raising animals, every day her husband works as a building contractor. Therefore, her family's income is quite stable ranging from 15.00 USD to 18.00 USD per day. She already went through one cycle of borrowing from the fund and repaying the loan, and she really likes this form of loan. It agrees with the goals and income of her family. This time she would like to borrow 260.00 USD to buy feed for the pigs, chickens and ducks. The other members in her group are:\r\nMr. Le Dac Chinh, #09010007, loan amount 260.00 USD to raise pigs;\r\nMr. Le Dac Tuyen, # 09010016, loan amount 195.00 USD to buy chicken feed;\r\nMs. Le Thi Hang, # 09010012, loan amount 260.00 USD to raise pigs;\r\nMS.

In order to earn additional income to supplement the family finances, she decided to go into business and rented an outlet at the market to sell a variety of linens. Building on her entrepreneurial experience she has reinvested money netted from the business. Her inventory includes a board selection of bath and kitchen towels, and a variety of bed linens and pillows.  She also carries bedding gift sets.  Mavjuda sells her goods at the Korvon wholesale market in the city of Dushanbe.

However, they still need new loans to enable them to enhance their businesses. They are thus requesting a loan of Le 1,600,000. Kadiatu, 37, is the leader of the group. She was born in Magoreh village, seven miles from Makeni. She is married and has five children. Her husband is also a businessman. Kadiatu has sold dried fish for the past 10 years. She buys fish in a village called Tombo which is about 10 miles from Freetown. With this loan, Kadiatu is expecting an increase in her profits, which will enable her to provide better for her children.  One of the great challenges Kadiatu faces as a dried fish seller is that they sometimes unknowingly buy a basket of fish that is mixed with some rotten ones.

Never having gone to school, as is true for most women of her age, she was initiated into commercial work at a tender age by her mother.  Developing in the food sector, notably in selling peanut butter, she has much business sense, thanks to 30 years of experience accumulated through doing this work. \r\n\r\nTo obtain peanut butter, the peanuts are sorted, roasted in an oven (very often built locally), peeled, winnowed, and then taken to the mill (for converting into a paste). The peanut butter obtained in this way is then put into plastic buckets.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago. After four solidarity loans (group loans) that were all correctly repaid, she is on her third individual loan. She intends to use this loan to buy 1,000 kg of peanuts and 50 plastic buckets (for conditioning the peanut butter). She gets her supplies locally in Koutiala from wholesale merchants who stock grains. She sells her production at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, out of her home and with the difference public services, to customers generally composed of women (housewives and retailers) and salaried workers. Her business cycle (purchasing, production, and sales) is one month in length.\r\n\r\nBecause of the quality of her peanut butter, Ms. Assitan Sidib\u00e9 enjoys a great reputation in this business of making peanut butter.  She receives many orders, especially from retailers and from families wanting to stock up against price fluctuations. She intends to realize a profit of 90,000 francs per month that she envisions using for covering the loan interest and for helping with the day-to-day expenses of the family. In the future, her ambition is to open a shop to become a peanut butter wholesaler. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She lives with her husband and children in a monogamous family in the M\u00e9dine district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali).  From her earliest years, she devoted herself to income-generating work to assist her parents in supporting her family.  Once she became of age, she opted at the age of 15 to do commerce in lumber.  Settled in at the M\u00e9dine marketplace on one of the busiest boulevards in town, and being the only woman busy selling lumber, Ms. Hawa T. is a focus of curiosity and unusual fame in S\u00e9gou.  \r\n\r\nIn order to better stand up to the competition, in a sector dominated by men, she decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  She is on her second individual loan, after having settled four group loans (solidarity loans), which were all correctly repaid.  She intends to use this loan to buy 1,500 pieces of lumber in Zantiguila (one of the marketplaces for lumber located on the edge of a closed forest) from woodsmen traders authorized by the government of Mali.  With customers made up exclusively of wholesalers from big cities, Ms. Hawa T. generally makes her sales in cash and rarely on credit.  She envisions realizing a profit per cycle (lasting four weeks on average) of 100,000 francs which enables her to come to the aid of her elderly mother  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

After a series of individual setbacks, they formed a group to join the Soro Yiriwaso group loan program and this will be their first loan.  With this loan of approximately $55 (25,000 XOF) per member, they intend to buy 150 kilograms of fruit, 60 cans of drinks and various other articles.

With this loan they will hire assistants to help them increase their production, which will increase their sales and reap greater profits with the goal of saving for the welfare of their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Gould, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4825,"image":{"id":208655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"capital so they can hire helpers and increase their production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto \/ La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2008-09-30T17:21:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Venanacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-14T23:24:24Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33673.2,"loan_amount":4825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5612.2},{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5612.2},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5612.2},{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5612.2},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5612.2},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5612.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":804.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":804.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":804.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":804.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":804.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":804.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":804.17,"local_amount":5612.2,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-07T08:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5616.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345442,"comment":null},{"amount":804.17,"local_amount":5612.2,"processed_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5616.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9967979,"comment":null},{"amount":804.17,"local_amount":5612.2,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5616.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884395,"comment":null},{"amount":804.17,"local_amount":5612.2,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5616.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433843,"comment":null},{"amount":804.17,"local_amount":5612.2,"processed_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-17T08:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5616.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128237,"comment":null},{"amount":804.15,"local_amount":5612.2,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5616.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025111,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-30T23:24:24Z","paid_date":"2009-05-20T08:29:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":67386,"name":"Rosales Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cRosales\u201d es la denominaci\u00f3n que adoptan 10 mujeres, agrupadas para trabajar junto a la instituci\u00f3n de Pro-Mujer.

They live in the zone with the same name, Gosalvez, in the village of Nuevo Potos\u00ed which is an area located on the western slope of the city of La Paz.  This hillside is characterized by having migrants from the high plains region.  In this zone they are generally dedicated to commerce, services and also to production, and most of the members work along these lines. <p>   \r\n\r\nThe communal bank GOSALVEZ has worked with our institution for five cycles, having funded itself on January 10, 2007.  Currently, the group consists of ten members with a management team as follows: <p>   \r\n\r\n- President Catalina L.\r\n- Treasurer Paulina M. Q.\r\n- Secretary Sofia V. A. <p>   \r\n\r\nIt must be highlighted that the group works with great solidarity, companionship and responsability; they learned how to save within the organization, given that in our country it is very difficult because of the social and economic situation we are going through.  The reasons that motivate them to work with this type of credit, as the women indicate, is that within the association they have a safe haven where they find motivation, fraternization, a space where they feel heard and can talk about their personal issues.  They later leave feeling renewed and able to again face all of their problems. <p>   \r\n\r\nCatalina L. Condori:  Has as her primary activity sales from a store that is located in her home.  She lives with her husband who earns his wages as a taxi driver.  Since their family does not count on a fixed income, they have turned to loans from the institution and one of this woman\u2019s dreams is to see her children become professionals.  One of them is in sergeant\u2019s school, and the other is still in secondary school. <p>   \r\n\r\nAgustina M. Q.: Has as her primary activity the sale of lubricants and production of blankets in her own home.  This woman, with effort and sacrifice, works together with her husband to support their four children.  Thanks to the loan granted by the institution, she has been able to buy equipment for making blankets and that way increase her working capital. <p>   \r\n\r\nGuillermo M. N.: Has his own business making footwear in his own home.  His wife has as her primary activity food sales in the zone of Chijini.  Despite the fact that they both work, their income wasn\u2019t enough to be able to save.  However, with the loan they were granted by the institution they were able to increase their capital and save for their children as they have hope to see them get ahead. <p>   \r\n\r\nPaulina M. Q.:  Mother of four children, she is an employee of a butcher\u2019s shop.  She earns a minimal wage which did not meet the family\u2019s financial needs, which is why she decided to join her husband in making footwear to offer for sale.  The loan granted by Emprender increased her working capital and, in turn, her production and income which simultaneously helped improve her economic situation. <p>   \r\n\r\nJuana Sabina T. N.:  Has as her principal activity the making and sale of jackets.  Despite the fact that she is still a single young woman, she is in charge of caring for her parents and brothers and therefore finds herself as the head of household.  Thanks to the loan granted her, she has managed to produce jackets for both men and women of different sizes.  Before, she was lacking in raw materials which was a difficulty.  One of her dreams is to one day have her own store and to be able to export her designs. <p>   \r\n\r\nSofia V. A.:  Has as her principal activity the sale of undergarments and socks.  Given that she does not count on a fixed wage, her income was not sufficient.  She sought a loan to help her to increase and diversify her products.  Her principal objective is to be able to save so she can buy her own plot of land. <p>   \r\n\r\nDominga N. A.:  Dedicates herself to the sale of aprons, and finds herself in charge of supporting her five children.  The only income with which the family can count on is hers, since the children are still in school.  With the loan granted her, it has become a possibility that this woman might be able to buy her own stand and a stock of merchandise. <p>   \r\n\r\nTeodora Q. Cayo:  Has as her activity the fabrication and sale of footwear, and she also cares for her six children given that the father is in a rural area.  It is for this reason that she assumed the expenses and responsibilities of the home.  Her dream is to be able to have a store and increase her capital, in order to produce her shoes for men, women and children. <p>   \r\n\r\nFlora R. M.:  This woman has as her principal activity the sale of fruit.  She has a large family, and their income is dependent on her.  With the loan from the institution she has managed to increase her capital, and in that way purchase more seasonal products and improve the financial situation for herself and her children. <p>   \r\n\r\nIrene C. M.:  This woman works tending to a public restroom, and her husband earns his wages as a chauffer.  The family\u2019s income is minimal, and does not cover their basic needs.  With her loan, she has managed to purchase gifts which she sells in various locales close to her work and in this way try to improve their very difficult economic situation.  <p>   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":208729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2008-10-08T13:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sof\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T18:15:22Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":383.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312476,"comment":null},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9929701,"comment":null},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15639511,"comment":null},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-19T08:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393510,"comment":null},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085305,"comment":null},{"amount":383.35,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978802,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-08T18:15:22Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:24:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":67405,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pedro P. de 22  a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y vive con sus padres en la ciudad de Caaguaz\u00fa.\r\n  Pedro,  desde peque\u00f1o trabajaba en la carpinter\u00eda de su padre ayud\u00e1ndolo en el oficio, hasta que en el a\u00f1o 2.006 quedo a cargo de la carpinter\u00eda, ya que su padre se enfermo y Pedro ya no quer\u00eda que trabaje.\r\n  Actualmente  esta fabricando muebles de todo tipo tales como: roperos, fiambreras y modulares.

In general, this area of town is devoted to commerce and services, and therefore the majority of bank members fall into this category.  \r\nThe Entrepreneurs Commercial Bank has its roots in the restructuring of God\u2019s Love Commerical Bank.  It was founded on October 3, 2007, and has worked with this field partner through three loan cycles.  Currently the group has ten members.  President Mery Margot A. C., treasurer Cinda G. Bascope, and secretary Pamela Vasquez M. sit on its board of directors.  It should be noted that the group projects solidarity, companionship, and responsibility; those within the association have learnt to save despite encountering setbacks in the last loan cycle. Members do not want to leave the association.  This type of loan in particular motivates the members to work.  The ladies indicate that within their association they find a place that provides relaxation, motivation, and companionship, a setting where they feel heard and can speak of personal problems, a haven from which they can then go forth empowered to once again tackle those problems. \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica Erika A. P.\u2019 main business is the sale of tea.  Due to this business and together with her husband\u2019s assistance, Ver\u00f3nica envisions the possibility of being able to support their two children, both of whom are still in school.  Her sole dream of seeing her children become professionals caused her to join the association to be able to expand her business.\r\n\r\nCinda G. Bascope currently works in food distribution.  In the past she sold food; however, in order to spend more time with her children she opted for becoming a distributor.  She dreams that her children would lack for nothing and works with her husband, an electrician, towards this end. As a mother, she is dedicated to her work and her children.  Cinda lives in the Villa Victoria neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMaria de Carmen C. S. is a person who has a great deal of responsibility.  Throughout the day she commutes between Villa Victoria, where her home is located, and El Alto where she markets bread in El Ceibo, returning once again to her home to sell lubricants.  Despite her comings and goings, she is always within earshot of her children.  Her husband drives a taxi, which puts food on the table and contributes to household maintenance.\r\n\r\nJaneth Cristina N. plays her part at a Punto Cotel, a La Paz telecommunications company that provides Internet, telephone and cable television services.  She dreams of seeing her only son become a professional, but also hopes to be able to buy a house for her family, and to attain this goal works six days a week.  She is a person who is very dedicated to her business and to her family.  Her husband is a tailor, who works out of the home.\r\n\r\nVincente C. M. shoulders a lot of responsibility for his family.  As the head of household, this father occupies a special role in his home since his children look to him as a role model.  He engages in two endeavors to put food on the table and contribute to his children\u2019s education, an expansion service and the neighborhood store.  His wife sells food.  Not wanting his children to be simple shopkeepers but to become professionals, he puts all his efforts towards giving them the best so that one day they might be persons of means.\r\n\r\nMery Margot A. C. is single because she has not yet found the ideal partner.  Her dream is to have a family that would be a shining example to those around them, but she is patient and ever hopeful. She sells all sorts of beauty products and due to the business is able to save for the future so she will not be in need.  She also hopes to have her own house where she might live comfortably.  \r\n\r\nPamela Lucy Vasquez M. is a young woman devoted to her studies and her work, on the road to becoming a professional.  At present she has no children and therefore can take advantage of this opportunity to be able to move forward and complete her education.  She sells office supplies.  Her parents\u2019 help and the needed loan will assist her in completing her studies.\r\n\r\nRossemary Marcela M. M. is a woman who, together with her husband, looks out for the welfare of her children.  She spends her day in her home tending a small shop located in the house itself, always within earshot of her children, listening to them and helping them with whatever she can.  Her husband works all day as a laborer in a factory located in El Alto.  Both dream of seeing their children grow up without lacking anything.  \r\n\r\nGuillermo Tito T. Cossio unfortunately is divorced.  At present he has no one in his care as his wife took the children, leaving him alone.  However, this was not a reason to give up on life.  Despite the solitude, he moves forward, taking advantage of neighborhood sporting events to sell soft drinks, candy and other products.  He also makes shoes in order to have a bit more income. He continues to live with the hope of seeing his children once again.  \r\n\r\nBeatriz Maria P. Q. has two children in her care.  She and her husband do everything possible to support them.  Due to the current circumstances facing the country, she is in need of this loan to be able to increase her working capital for the sale of bread, and the profit generated will allow her children to complete their education.  She is a very dedicated and responsible woman.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":208727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2008-10-08T18:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janeth Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Pamela Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rossemary Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo Tito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Beatriz Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T21:43:16Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":11897.44,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2974.36},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2974.36},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2974.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2974.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":2974.36,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312477,"comment":null},{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":2974.36,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9929702,"comment":null},{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":2974.36,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15639512,"comment":null},{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":2974.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-19T08:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393511,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-08T21:43:16Z","paid_date":"2009-03-19T08:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":67407,"name":"Shyrley","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Srta.

At 20 years old she went to work in the city of Ilo, returned to the countryside at 28 years old as her mother was in ill health and later passed away. She married at 30 years old, sadly her husband abandoned her when her son was only 3 months old. Since then she has assumed the role of father and mother, educating her son through the 5th year of secondary school, then he went to work in Lima and today it is he who supports her economically.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to buy more cattle to fatten and have a small stable.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva

Another part of the loan she used it to buy raw materials for the elaboration of the chipas.<p>\r\n\r\nHer main clients are the motorists and the people from nearby cities who drive past  the city going to neighboring towns.\r\n<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ana Gabriela Clark, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":208817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds, plants, fertelizers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caacupe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.383333 -57.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-16T18:35:52Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9937149,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-22T08:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860722,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20402015,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094092,"comment":null},{"amount":77.49,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35987611,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44568826,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959186,"comment":null},{"amount":77.51,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T09:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176437,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602108,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":307675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038359,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-02T18:35:52Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T18:32:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":67459,"name":"Herminia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Herminia es natural del Centro Poblado de Acari, distrito y provincia de Yunguyo.

She is married and mother of three children (two girls who are two and eight years old, and a boy who is four years old). She lives in Jr. Puno, district of Mazocruz, province of El Collao, Puno.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the community bank \"Generaci\u00f3n 2000\" in Mazocruz. She decided to join the community bank five years ago because she lacked capital to stock her grocery shop. With the initial credit of 300 Soles, she bought one bag of rice, one bag of sugar, etc. At six years of age, her father abandoned her and she had to go out to sell gelatin. From age nine to eighteen, she sold groceries in the markets of Tupala, Huacullani, Huaitiri, and others. At age nineteen she married her husband and they installed their grocery shops. With a capital accumulated, she presently sells fuel, alpaca, llama, and sheep meat, mostly to the wholesalers of Tacna.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1500 Soles, which she will repay in four months, she proposes to buy one cylinder of fuel with 600 Soles and with the rest of the capital she will buy alpacas for the sale of meat. Each alpaca costs 180 to 200 Soles.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have a very beautiful home in Mazocruz, set up a commercial shop, hire employees to attend to the public, and she will just administer it. Her goal is also that her kids study and become professionals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":208878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy fuel and alpacas for the cost of meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mazocruz, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.75 -69.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-14T16:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaneth Melania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-28T22:40:32Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331013,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951383,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224410,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417133,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-14T22:40:32Z","paid_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":67505,"name":"San Pablo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el centro focal Panamericana podemos encontrar a la asociaci\u00f3n \u201cSan Pablo\u201d  a la fecha cuenta con nueve miembros activos que trabajan junto a Pro-Mujer hace m\u00e1s de siete a\u00f1os. \r\nDiversos son los negocios de esta asociaci\u00f3n  por ejemplo algunas de ellas tienen una mini- distribuidora de perfumes de marca( Reblon), Sonia es due\u00f1a de una tienda de abarrotes, Luz al igual que otras de sus compa\u00f1eras se dedican a la venta de electrodom\u00e9sticos que por lo general los dejan a cr\u00e9dito a instituciones   y personas particulares.

She also plans to deliver grocery products to the various markets to generate more earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":208885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"five head of alpaca","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mazocruz, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.75 -69.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-14T16:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudith Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-28T21:57:08Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331015,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951385,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224412,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":204.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-14T21:57:08Z","paid_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":67510,"name":"Peque\u00f1o Milagro (Small Miracle) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este comit\u00e9 se encuentra actualmente en su segundo  ciclo cuenta con 17 integrantes.<P>\r\nLas integrantes se dedican a actividades varias las cuales se detallan a continuaci\u00f3n:<p>\r\n-Lida C., cantina <p>\r\n-Francisca C., Vta de mercaderias varias<p>\r\n-Letizia T., Venta de ropas<p>\r\n-Nilda A., Venta de comestibles<p>\r\n-Mirian N., Venta de ropas<p>\r\n-Marina C., Venta de ropas usadas<p>\r\n-Liliana N., Venta de lenceria<p>\r\n-Lourdes C., Venta de bebidas y ropas<p>\r\n-Maria Dolores E., Venta de comestibles<p>\r\n-Blanca B., Venta de lenceria<p>\r\n-Paola O., Venta de comestibles<p>\r\n-Ramona S., Kiosko<p>\r\n-Maria Victoria E., Peluqueria<p>\r\n-Sonia V., Venta de minutas<p>\r\n-Angela G., Vta de comestibles<p>\r\n-Maria C., Vta de frutas<p>\r\n-Marcelina R., Vta de comestibles.<p>\r\nLa Directora de este comit\u00e9 es la Sra.

To increase their production, they need to buy more raw materials, such as cow leather and vicuna wool for weaving blankets. Their dream is to form a large business that will generate greater incomes for their families and provide work opportunities to others.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":208906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy leather and vicuna wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto \/ La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2008-10-05T23:20:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marizol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arnold","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T03:23:36Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21818.16,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3636.36},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3636.36},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3636.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3636.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":520.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":520.83,"local_amount":3636.36,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-07T08:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345450,"comment":null},{"amount":520.83,"local_amount":3636.36,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9967987,"comment":null},{"amount":520.83,"local_amount":3636.36,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-25T08:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884403,"comment":null},{"amount":520.83,"local_amount":3636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433851,"comment":null},{"amount":520.83,"local_amount":3636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-17T08:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128245,"comment":null},{"amount":520.85,"local_amount":3636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025119,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-06T03:23:36Z","paid_date":"2009-05-20T08:30:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":67520,"name":"La Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Comit\u00e9 se formo gracias a las Se\u00f1oras: Antonia T. y Silvia Lorena A., quienes se enteraron acerca del Programa y de la fundaci\u00f3n gracias a las integrantes del comit\u00e9 \u201cMujeres Victoriosas\u201d, del mismo Barrio San Antonio de la ciudad de Lambar\u00e9.<P>\r\nPodemos hablar de alguna de las integrantes en este caso de: La Sra.

She has three children and lives with her partner. Many years ago she went to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she spent all of her childhood. There she began to work in a factory, where she prepared french fries, which were packed and sold in supermarkets. \r\n\r\nMara met another Paraguayan in this factory and they first became friends, then partners. They decided to return together to Paraguay. They bought some land in the Villa Zulma settlement in the San Antonio neighborhood in the city of Lambar\u00e9. \r\n\r\nThe pair continued to make french fries, and they tested the market by distributing the fries from their home. This was successful.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Mrs. Mara Luz became a member of the Women with Hope committee in order to increase her sales. Today she fills orders for food stores and supermarkets. \r\n\r\nThe other members work in the following sectors:\r\n1.- Silvia  A.
