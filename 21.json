All of the members of the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that it is imperative for the communities it works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water from the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":35863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farm rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-16T22:59:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-01T22:16:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:25:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21965,"comment":"1er pago asociacion 1 de agosto de sta lucia"},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:25:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29292,"comment":"2do pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:11:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40399,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:21:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65661,"comment":"4to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":561,"local_amount":561,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":561,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66077,"comment":"5to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-18T22:16:09Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10118,"name":"Felipe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>  Felipe has a small piece of land that he inherited from his father.

To have enough milk for the little girl, Ismatullo purchased a dairy cow. Now Ismatullo has a plan to reconstruct his house and extend the space for his household. His request for a loan is to purchase hogs and sheep. Ismatullo has been working for 23 years at a music school. He teaches children to play the national instrument, the \u201cdoyra\u201d. He likes his job but says that livestock is the business of his family. It is passed from one generation to another."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":35928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Puchase

A. is 30 years old, single, and lives with two dependants, a boy and a girl, who are members of his extended family. One of the dependant\u2019s parents died due to HIVAIDS and the other was abandoned during the 1992 land clashes in the Transmara region of Kenya. He lives with them within Kayole, Kenya.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Mark ventured into the business sector by doing tailoring and dressmaking, which he did for 3 years. The business capital was provided by Kenya Agency of Development and Entrepreneurial Technology (KADET), a World Vision micro-finance wing. A loan of Ksh 56,000.00 (USD 800) enabled him to buy sewing machines and clothing materials and he was later able to settle the loan. A golden opportunity from the World Vision emerged and got him a tender to make school uniforms for four schools within Kayole. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, as a form of business expansion, Mark started a mobile phone repair shop and sale of mobile phone accessories. He employed 3 orphans who had gone through technical skills training sponsored by World Vision. Besides offering mobile phone charging services, the number of clients seeking phone repairs has greatly increased. He is currently not able to serve his customers effectively since he lacks computers and power flashers that enable detection of a problem in the phone software hence he incurs extra costs in having to seek that kind of service in the city centre, 20 kilometers from his business location. \r\n\r\nMark is requesting for a loan of (USD 650) to enable him purchase a computer and power flashers. This will enable him to detect the problem in the phone software and to do repairs. This will help improve the profit margins by cutting down on costs of transportation and consultation services from other dealers and also bring flashing services closer to other technicians operating within Kayole. The business will also create employment for the people of Kayole. The loan is repayable within 12 \u2013 18 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":36057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone

The success registered so far is due the availability of local feeding materials. He is a third-time borrower. With his two previous loans, he succeeded in providing the community with manure and fresh raw foodstuffs. Benefits from his investment were primarily used for tuition. He succeeded in reducing the number of times his children were sent out of class for fee-drive. His immediate goal is to provide the basics of food, tuition, and clothing to his family.\r\n<p>\r\nGiven a loan of $400, he plans to buy ten piglets, feed, and medication and set aside some money for vet services for pigs. He plans to provide his community with large quantities of manure. \r\n<p>\r\nHe plans to pay his loan in 18 months. The first installment repayment shall be on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":36501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"production of

It was not an easy task for a woman in Uganda, but she was determined to obtain a job as a housekeeper in Kampala. It was through this job that she was introduced to Life in Africa. She has been an active member for the last six years.\r\n<p>\r\nZarina was forced to leave school at a very early age due to the civil war. Her family lost everything during this conflict and she was never able to return to school. This left her with poor English skills, and she was barely able to read or write. However, she knew the values of education, and she has made it her life\u2018s goal to make sure that her children are all educated. This goal prompted her to look for a way to secure their future.\r\n<br><br>\r\nZarina proved to be a smart business woman, and she saw the advantage of investing in income property. She managed to secure several loans through Life in Africa, and she built a solid housing unit in a poor section of Kampala. She has several tenants living in her property now, and she was able to pay back all her loans in a timely manner. Like any other Life in Africa member, she was among the first to take a loan of 800,000 from Kiva in May 2006.  She used her loan money to plaster her house, which ensured the quality of housing for her tenants. In addition, it also insured the value and durability of her property. She has repaid her loans without ever having a single late payment. Before plastering her house, she was earning 200,000 per month and is now earning 280,000 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nZarina feels that she should put a ceiling board in her four roomed house so that it may look attractive to her tenants and also may increase the house rent. Any additions to the house increase the rent, which would raise her income. To do this she is requesting a loan amount of 150 USD."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":36976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Putting a celing board in the house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyebando, Kampala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":8,"posted_date":"2007-05-21T01:11:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-04T03:02:25Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-06-29T09:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-29T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26808,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-07-29T09:15:20Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-29T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36402,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-08-29T09:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-29T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47535,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-21T03:02:25Z","paid_date":"2007-08-29T09:15:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10445,"name":"Moreen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

In 2003 insecurity in Northern Uganda was intense, and many helpless children were forced to sleep on the verandas of town buildings and escape abductions from rebels in surrounding villages.

Denis did not stop volunteering at night, but with the Life in Africa programs he started making paper beads, peace tiles, bracelets and other crafts during the day to earn income to support himself and his family. Through Life in Africa's computer training courses, Denis is now able to operate computers.

and her husband Mario have been living on their land for about ten years now. They have been able to slowly build their home out of hard work, although it is still admittedly in need of much improvement. Maria has a 7 year old daughter who she works hard to feed and educate. Her husband is a field worker who is mostly employed in big farms outside of their town. Meanwhile, Maria tends to their own piece of land with the help of Mario whenever he is out of work or she really needs him. They hope to invest in fertilizer and pesticides to preserve the crops they have already planted. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Anzuelo Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, El Anzuelo Asociacion, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Most recently, El Anzuelo was able to start a program that improved their members access to watering services.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of La Asociacion El Anzuelo de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other\u2019s guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financing, they have turned to loan sharks, paying between 100% and 240% annual interest.  Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and earn fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is a severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":37001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rice farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-28T02:48:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-11T18:16:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T17:00:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23691,"comment":"1er pago asociaci\u00f3n el anzuelo"},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T21:39:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33125,"comment":"2do pago asoc el anzuelo"},{"amount":633,"local_amount":633,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:24:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":633,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99068,"comment":"6to pago"},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210202,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-05-28T18:16:09Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10451,"name":"Soum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soum R. is 29 years old and is a mother of two children.

In 2003 Vladimir owned a business that sold vodka and wine. He approached Nadiya Ukraine about the possibility of getting a loan but was turned down because of our policy of not supporting businesses that sell alcohol \u2013 alcoholism is a huge problem in Ukraine. He was encouraged, however, to find another type of business and he decided to do just that. Using funding from a loan he was able to start a new venture selling sports apparel. Since that time his business has done quite well. He has been able to buy and remodel two sales locations and has built up around $10,000 worth of inventory. He typically will purchase about $3,000 worth of new inventory each month. Vladimir is quite a businessman and we are happy that he has chosen to apply his talents in a business that is constructive rather than destructive.\r\n<p>\r\nVladimir has requested an additional loan to give him more working capital to use in his business.

Recently, she was able to buy a refrigerator that she needed to offer higher quality products and to further expand her offering.\r\n\r\n<p>With the goal to increase her assortment, Gaby requests a loan of $475 that she will use to buy merchandise, because she wants to give good service to her customers and count on them to return.

Her husband is employed as a security guard, but his earnings do not cover the expenses of the family. Mariatu's small restaurant income is a crucial supplement to the overall family income.<p>\r\n\r\nMariatu sells cooked rice with cassava leaves, palm oil, peanut paste, mixed with fish and meat (local dishes in Sierra Leone). She is open everyday. Due to low working capital, Mariatu buys the ingredients in small quantities on a daily basis. At times this can be more expensive, especially when the palm oil and the local rice are out of season. Traveling several times to the village market to purchase the items leaves Mariatu with less time to attend to her business.
