The official name of this borrowing group is Rosemarie D..\n\nRosemarie is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosemarie owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling vegetables in the local community. Rosemarie has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2010, Rosemarie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services in order to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosemarie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Rosemarie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business. Her other 9 members also are requesting 5000 PHP each for their additional capital and their group loan has a total of 50000 PHP.  \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

Hermelinda Gilberta O. T. is the leader of the group.  She is 25, and she sells fruits and soft drinks in the afternoons.  She takes this opportunity to sell roasted corn on the cob.  She started her business with help from her sister 12 years ago.  She sold fruit in the offices close to where her sister was selling.  The fruit that she sold was provided by her sister.  \r\n\r\nShe was earning money, and she managed to buy her own fruit.  She also sold sweets.  Three years later she was able to have her own small stand on 35th Street Galerias del Sur in zone 11 in the capital.  From there she was able to have a business stocked with sweets and fruits.  Her biggest wish is to be able to excel in her small business and stock it with imported fruits.\r\n\r\nHilda T., another member of the group, has had a tortilla business in her house for eight years.  Her family is comprised of five minor children.  Her dream for her business is to be able to have another type of sales like firewood and beans to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nThe other member of the group, Ana Rosalia T. T., has been selling tortillas for five years.  Her business is in her house.  She has three minor children.  Her biggest wish for her business is to hire another person to help her.  She wants to do this in order to take care of the demand that she has in her business.\r\n\r\nThese women are requesting this loan because they have many plans and dreams for their lives.  Therefore, they need the capital to work in their businesses. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":599226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-09-13T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda Gilberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Rosaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":1000.08,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396346,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534901,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137554,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414983,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833576,"comment":null},{"amount":124.99,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201276106,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206397888,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216325,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494696,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T00:32:40Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230652,"name":"Franklin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nFranklin  vive zona  Quillviri, Provincia  Aroma, del Departamento La Paz , se dedica a la cr\u00eda de ganado vacuno cuya producci\u00f3n de leche lo vende a Pil Andina (Planta industrializadota  de leche), tambi\u00e9n trabaja como conductor de maquinaria pesada en el alcald\u00eda de su zona, vive junto a su   esposa y sus hijos  los cuales se encuentran en edad escolar.

Over time, she has been able to add essential products and cosmetics to her store and has been able to earn the income that she needs to cover her children's educational expenses.  Her children also help her run the store.  As she is an enterprising woman, she plans to expand her store and offer a greater variety of goods to her customers.  This is her second loan from MFP and she promises to pay it back punctually; she would like to continue working hard to progress.

T. is a 41 year old woman who lives with her husband and 5 children in a community called Coquital. Coquital stands out as a mountainous zone that is located near to the Northern border of Costa Rica. Paula sells cow's milk and cheeses. In her farmyard, she has several cows, but she says that she does not have enough to fill the demand in her community. For this reason, she needs a loan of \u00a2609.000 (six hundred nine thousand colones) to purchase more cows and thus increase her production. She is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Rapicr\u00e9dito Progreso Futuro Coquital, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

She is married to Maximiano S., who is also her business partner. She is the mother of their six children, five of whom are already working and are settled down with their own families, while the youngest is currently enrolled in college. By the grace of God, Basiliza has managed to support her youngest child's schooling up to the college level. At this time, she is working hard to continue sending her youngest to college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Basiliza, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nBasiliza operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, electronic phone load, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of $5 to $7.50 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nBasiliza dreams to be able to give her youngest child a quality education through all her hard work on her business.

L. is from the village of Sinait. He is 45 years old. Noel is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Noel owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Noel has been engaged in his business for over 20 years and earns approximately 30,000 PHP per harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Noel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Noel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Noel is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Noel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is an active member and treasurer of Nkumari Group which is being funded by Juhudi Kilimo. He has been farming for the past 6 years and has employed 2 casual labourers. His main products are bananas and milk which he sells through middlemen and through the Imenti Dairy Society respectively. He also earns income from his commercial buildings at a local market and rental houses.\r\n\r\nAndrew fully repaid his previous loan from Juhudi and has requested this loan of 50,000 KES to construct a zero-grazing shed. He says that the income from his farming will help pay college fees for one of his children.

Quyet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock.

His work revolves mostly around the collection of revenue from restaurant owners and taxi operators. \r\n<p>\r\nThe hardworking Moses says he was formerly employed at a local factory. This, he says, gave him some firsthand experience on how to run a business. The happily married father of two says he makes 54,000 UGX in weekly profits.

Humanity is always anxious for success. Even in developing countries where in order to achieve, one should make every effort, people hope for the best. \n\nBurul A. is 55, a widow and is leader of the group. Now her children are most important in supporting her. Her daughter is a saleswoman in a sausage shop, while her daughter-in-law helps her to run a business. Seventeen years ago Burul began to earn money by sewing small orders for fellow villagers. She has finally seen some personal results from her efforts: she managed to buy a new electric sewing machine with the help of which she will sew national cloth and dressmaking supplies. With a loan Burul wants to buy a multi-logic sewing machine. Burul\u2019s aim is to open sewing workshop.\n\nGulmira A. is the group treasurer. She is 41, married and has three children. Her husband is a guest worker in Russia. Besides selling towels in the market, she gets some material support from her older children. With a loan she would like to increase her commodity\u2019s circulation and to buy more towels to sell. In the future Gulmira is planning to open her own private shop. \n\nDaniyar M., 27, is married and has two infants. Six years ago he decided to start a private enterprise in Taras, Kazakhstan, breeding cattle. Now he is working in the wholesale and retail towel trade. His loan purpose is to increase his working capital.\n\nAiymkan A., 36, is marriedand runs her business by herself because her husband is working in Russia. She makes a profit from sewing items by request. In the past she was a saleswoman of children\u2019s clothes in Bishkek. She has managed to buy an auto and some cattle. The purpose of her loan is to buy more material for sewing.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abduhalim is 31 years old, married and has three children. He is a farmer growing onions, corn, rice, and nuts--something he has done for 11 years. This is the only thing he knows how to do and what he likes most to do. For Abduhalim, there is nothing better than being in touch with nature and watching the crops he has planted grow year after year.\r\n\r\n In addition, Abduhalim raises cattle and his family helps him with his business. Now he wants to borrow money to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his crops. This is the second loan of Abduhalim from IMON International and he promises to repay the loan without any violations as he did with his previous loan. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live together in a peaceful home located in a populated neighborhood to the north of the city.  She remembers how when she was very small she used to help her parents, who were big flower merchants.  At the beginning, she started bundling flowers, then later she decorated the pots and as time went on she performed more complicated tasks.\r\nA few years later, and after she was married, she decided along with her partner to sell flowers and pots, since she knew this business to be quite profitable.  She and her husband buy flowers from the wholesalers in the city, and later prepare the arrangements and pots, and her husband takes them to the provinces.  Her main desire is to have a business selling flowers in a shopping center.  To do this she must work with a lot of effort and dedication.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she pledges to make her payments on time, since she wants to continue working so that she can achieve progress.  In addition, she is very satisfied with the work that she does with the members of her group, since her group is made up of very responsible and cooperative people.  Maria plans to invest the loan requested in the purchase of a greater quantity of flowers and a greater variety of pots, since she has various orders from the provinces, and she wants to fill all of

She lives in the northern part of Kyrgyzstan, in Baetovo village.  In 1996, she graduated from the State Agricultural University and had great plans for the further development of her life. \r\n\r\nHowever, in 1998, she was given into marriage to a villager (in accordance with antiquated nomadic tradition which fortunately quite rarely exists at present times) and became a part of a large family. This moment became crucial and moved her life in another direction.  She found a job at a local company, but her salary didn\u2019t cover all the expenses of her family.  In order to find a means of subsistence for her children,  Dinara decided to start her businesses of cattle breeding and farming the land, growing wheat and potatoes. Using her initial capital of 15,000 KGS, she bought one milk cow and sheep.  Thanks to Damira\u2019s hardworking and persistent personality, today she has two milk cows, two calves, ten sheep and three goats.  \r\n\r\nAs Damira is the only breadwinner for the family, she needs this loan of 58,000 KGS to purchase five sheep for fattening and reselling. Also, she plans to buy two colts, which will be used as a means of transportation for her two sons (11 and 8 years old), who help her in farming and today need to travel the distance of about 10 kilometers from the village up to their land.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She lives in her own house together with her two beloved daughters, Yoselin who is 14 and Lisbeth who is 12 years old, and to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life.  In the comfort of her home, Margarita weaves colored handcrafted garments by hand.  Every day she starts working very early, since she has to complete the orders that her buyers make.  She not only sells what she weaves, but also she collects garments from other weavers, who also receive a good payment for their work.  What she likes most about her work, is that she also helps her coworkers get ahead.  She has been doing this work for 15 years, and what she considers most difficult is to be able to wake up early in order to complete the orders.  In the future, she hopes to form a business with her weaving colleagues, so that they can all develop themselves.  This is her fourth loan with MFP, in her previous payments she was always very punctual and she expects to be so now also.  The members of her community bank are very fond of her, since she is very responsible.

It is located in the community of Hueyapan, Morelos State, M\u00e9xico, and is composed of five women members who have been neighbors for a long time.  The members are: Hermelinda S. S. who will use the loan to buy eggs, sugar, bread, detergent, etc. to stock her store; Obdulia S. T. who will buy bulk sorghum animal feed for her sheep, Hilaria M. C. who will buy women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing and linens at wholesale to stock up; Yasmin Isabel R. M. who will pay for a tune-up for her taxi and buy replacement parts for her vehicle; Argelia P. E. who will buy tires and pay for a tune-up for her vehicle.\r\n\r\nObdulia, 54, studied up to 6th grade.  She has three children: Fredy, 31, who is married and employed, Alma, 29, who is also married and employed and Viridiana, 22, who is a student and still depends on Obdulia.\r\n\r\nShe raises sheep and will use the loan to buy sorghum feed in bulk to feed them.  She started raising sheep 12 years ago.  She participates in a group where they are trained to raise animals.  They learn how to feed them, what vaccines they need, how to rid them from parasites.  The government helped her buy four sheep.  Her customers are the farm that the group belongs to.  A trailer comes to Huayapan to load up the sheep.  It takes quite a few.  It gathers the sheep from various people.  The newborn sheep take 7 to 8 months to be at weight.  The ewes have 2 to 3 sheep each year and a half.\r\n\r\nHer business is important and special because thanks to the animals she was able to raise her children.  When she needs money urgently selling a sheep solves her problem and she has money.  The business has helped her a lot to meet household expenses and to cover her children\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\r\nHer husband works in the fields and also helps raise the sheep.  He vaccinates them, de-parasites them and feeds them.\r\n\r\nProfits are reinvested in sorghum feed for the sheep which daily increases in cost making it progressively more expensive to feed the animals.\r\n\r\nShe hopes in the future that her youngest daughter finds work.  She is going to sell her animals to support her while she finds work.  She also wants to provide her house with some maintenance because it needs it and she also wants to repay her loans.\r\n\r\nThe town of Hueyapan has a cold climate and there are many fruit trees: peaches, avocado, pears, tejocote (fruit resembling a sloe), apples, walnuts, capulines (a cherry-like tropical fruit), and raspberries.\r\n\r\nThe group members want to say to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad:  \u201cThank you very much for getting me out of a momentary sticky situation and we are grateful for the loan.\u201d\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

She comments that she has managed to succeed with her business because of her dedication and effort, and that\u2019s how she has money for small expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the money she earns from her business on a daily basis, she puts aside to buy more merchandise each week so that her stock looks good and her customers are interested in buying from her. Her dream is to see her business grow day by day so she can save more and build a better place for it. Then her customers will be able to shop in comfort. She also wants to put cement on the walls of her house, something that is very important to her.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dolores became part of the group when one of her neighbours invited her to join the program and get a loan to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of the following people:\r\nTomasa S\u00e1nchez P. will use the loan to buy ingredients such as chicken, seafood, and vegetables for her small food business.\r\nMar\u00eda Dolores P\u00e9rez L\u00f3pez will use the loan to buy merchandise such as sugar, rice, oil, and beans for her grocery store.\r\n\r\nCarolina G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez will use the loan to buy chickens for grilling and then sell the pieces cooked and seasoned.\r\n\r\nRosa del Carmen G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez will use the loan to buy ingredients such as meat, chilies, onions, and vinegar to make chorizo sausages.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":595048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-16T17:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Doloes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3540.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121208,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1770.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415364,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1770.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415365,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3540.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554962,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3540.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691452,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-16T19:32:08Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230959,"name":"Katiusca Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Portoviejo capital manabita, conocida por su clima c\u00e1lido y  agradable encontramos el Banco Comunal Los Jazmines  que se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas en esta linda ciudad.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora katiuska tiene 33 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada hace 15 a\u00f1os y fruto de esta relaci\u00f3n ha tenido tres hermosos ni\u00f1os que estudian en la escuela y en el colegio.

He lives in his own home with his wife Eva and he tries to work as hard as he can to improve their quality of life.  In the Miraflores community (in the district of La Merced) Leoncio runs his business out of his home; he sells chickens, ducks and geese.  He does his best to keep them well-fed and well taken care of so he can sell them more quickly.  He feels content with the money her earns through his business and would like to work harder to do even better in this line of work.  His favorite part of his job is feeding the birds as he feeds them a great amount of love; nonetheless, it takes a lot of time to take care of them.  In the future, he plans to rent a storefront where he can offer better attend to his customers.  This is his 3rd loan through MFP; he knows that he must make his payments punctually and he is willing to do so.  In his village bank, he is a very happy and responsible member.  With the 1500 soles (~$550 USD) that he is seeking, he will buy more food for his birds so they will grow larger and more healthy.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":599906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase food for his poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leoncio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1534.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549425,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-07T19:20:30Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230975,"name":"Rosmery","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sra.

Over time the loan group has also developed a relationship with the focus centre, which in this case is Centro Focal Santiago II.\r\n\r\nDionicia is the president of the association and one of its oldest members. She says she has been working with Pro Mujer for about five years. She became a member of the group at the invitation of her sister-in-law. She started by weaving for other people, that is, she worked as labourer for six years. Afterwards she realised that she could become independent and she started her own business weaving and selling alpaca wool blankets. Her first loan was for Bs1200, which she used to purchase alpaca wool to make the blankets. The loan she has now requested, for Bs.1500, is for the same purpose. Two more people help her with the business. At the moment she only has one child and lives with her partner. What she most likes about Pro Mujer is the chance to meet with the other members and get some training. \r\n\r\nThe members in the loan group all have different business, including selling clothes, selling meat, selling vegetables, selling metals, a neighbourhood shop, metal smelting, selling potato flour and potato, weaving and selling alpaca wool blankets. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alba Sort , Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":599924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Alpaca wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-09-15T07:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionicia Pl\u00e1cida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita Elza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cayetana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margot Janett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25815.4,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2581.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1117.5,"local_amount":7744.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7789.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177607218,"comment":null},{"amount":745.01,"local_amount":5163.1,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5192.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607950,"comment":null},{"amount":1117.5,"local_amount":7744.65,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7789.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188747010,"comment":null},{"amount":372.5,"local_amount":2581.55,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2596.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191485196,"comment":null},{"amount":372.49,"local_amount":2581.45,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2596.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912044,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T14:33:27Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:15:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230980,"name":"Mar\u00eda Marianita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda  es socia fundadora del Banco Comunal San Gregorio que se re\u00fane en la ciudadela del mismo nombre cada quince d\u00edas.\n \nMantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre hace 26 a\u00f1os y tiene cuatro hijos,  tres mayores  de edad y el ultimo que vive con ella y que esta por graduarse del colegio.\n\nDesde muy temprano se levanta a preparar el desayuno de su hijo y despu\u00e9s se va a su negocio de venta de jugos naturales  en la  terminal terrestre de Portoviejo en el cual tiene un puesto.

She lives in her own home and wants to work hard so she can progress in life.  Since she was little, she has worked with her parents cultivating their land.  Over the years, she has been able to buy her own land and now she is one of the primary growers of bananas and coffee in the Chanchamayo province, a place known for its agricultural products.  Her favorite part of her job is taking care of her products which she does lovingly; she has done this work for 15 years and feels like the most difficult part is taking the products to market.

El prestamo que solicita lo necesita para comprar mas productos como Ice Cream, paletas de uva, fresa, nance, coco, limon, etc y asi incrementar su inventario y poder ofrecer mas variedad a sus clientes. Su meta es poder tener su propia fabrica de helados y construir su casa propia, y que sus hijos sigan estudiando ya que son unos ni\u00f1os muy aplicados. ","en":"Maria Gloria M.

Maria Gloria is a very nice person and very popular amongst her neighbors. For many years she and her husband have been selling ice cream. She sells from their home while her husband sells from different grocery stores. One of the biggest challenges they face is that their are often power outages in their city and they do not have a generator. When the power goes out they lose money as their ice cream melts. The loan they are soliciting will be used to buy ice cream, and grape, strawberry, coconut, lemon popsicles in order to increase their inventory and offer their clients more variety. Their goal is to open their own ice cream production facility and build their own home and that their children continue to study since their currently very enthralled in their studies. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emanuela Villa, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":597495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Comprar helados","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-09-27T17:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172103253,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396148,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-09T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534705,"comment":null},{"amount":145.17,"local_amount":2680,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137379,"comment":null},{"amount":17.32,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":327.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833414,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-27T20:49:27Z","paid_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230992,"name":"Yesica Liseth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yesica Liseth R.

On weekends she also works at a discotheque near her home as a waitress.  She tells us that the commissions and incentives she gets from the beauty products sales she has bought items for her living room, bedroom, kitchen and dining room.  She also gets items that are on sale of both brands like shampoo, cologne, perfume, etc. and then resells them at a higher price.  This is how she is able to cover household expenses and provide her two children with what they need.\r\n\r\nBesides, Maria tells us that every week she participates in a junta (a collection of money among several persons) that is raffled off on the weekend.

H., age 39, lives in Colonia Miguel Barahona in the city of Juticalpa.  She lives with her husband and their three children; ages 9, 14, and 16.\r\n\r\nShe started out selling only churros, cookies, and soft drinks.  After a time she decided to establish a very well-stocked grocery store in her house.  She tended the store together with her husband.  But, she became ill with diabetes, and the business started to be neglected .  Her husband had to frequently take her to the hospital.  They did not have anyone to take care of the store, and they closed it.  Sales went down, and the customers who had credit did not pay.\r\n\r\nNilvia is currently requesting this loan to start stocking her grocery store.  She faithfully hope that this will generate enough income to support her family and to buy her medications.  Her dream is that God will give her great strength to endure this illness.  She also dreams of seeing her children become educated and improving her house.  \r\n\r\nWith the loans from FAMA she has been able to give her children an education and improve her standard of living.  She has purchased things for the home that allow them to be comfortable.  The loans have also allowed her to have a business, which is her source of daily support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is 48 years of age, married to Jesus U. and is blessed with 2 children, of whom one is working at Gaisano Ozamiz as promo-merchandiser and the other one is now a graduating student at BSMT- Nautical.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, she is presently engaged in a banana production and buying and selling business. She is also receiving regular support from her husband, who is a farmer. She has been engaged in this green banana buying and selling business for 10 years already and earns approximately 5,800 PHP a month from this business activity.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2008, Lilian joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilian is an active member of PMPC under the Regular Loan program and has successfully repaid a loan amount of 12,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan amount of 45,000 PHP as her 4th loan to be used for the educational expenses of her son who is now taking his SOLAS (safety of life at sea course for those wanting to work on ships) course this time. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of their family especially in meeting their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments, children\u2019s education, insurances and possible business expansions. \r\n\t\t\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
