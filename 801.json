En su banco comunal es un socio colaborador.\nCon los 1,000 nuevos soles, podr\u00e1 comprar fertilizantes para elaborar el mantenimiento de sus plantaciones. \n\n","en":"Ra\u00fal, 33, is a single young man. He lives in his own house and he has plans to carry out in the course of time. Ra\u00fal has been a farmer since he was very young. He began with farm work thanks to his parents, who taught him for 20 years. Ra\u00fal now has his own small farm where he grows cacao plants. At harvest times, he receives help from his neighbors, who come to quickly pick the produce. He then brings it to sell at the distribution centers located in the town of Palmapampa, where he sells it at a good price. Nevertheless, he thinks it is difficult not to be able to combat the infestations from which his crops suffer. From the time he found out about the loans that MFP facilitated, he did not hesitate, and went to the offices and told them about the problems that affected his production. In this way the lenders gave him the opportunity to continue with his plans for the work that he does. This will be his first loan with MFP. He is ready to make his payments on time so that at another point he can get another loan. In his communal bank, he is a collaborative member.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,000 nuevos soles, he will be able to buy fertilizers to maintain his crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1011907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

of this flower.  It is also well known because it is very close to a popular tourist spot called the architectural zone of Zirahuato.\r\n\r\nShe is 32 years old and is married to Jos\u00e9 Luis, who is in construction.  She tells us that she has 4 children, 3 of whom are in school.  She and her husband work very hard to give them a better standard of living as she herself only studied to the third grade because her parents were unable to keep supporting her due to a lack of resources.\r\n\r\nIn order to get ahead with the household\u2019s daily expenses, she makes caps, bags, and purses, but they are very peculiar in that she makes them from the rings off easy-open tin cans.  She tells us that she recycles them and interweaves them with yarn or heavy thread, giving them the form of bags, purses, satchels, caps, etc.  Sometimes there are people who sell the rings by the kilo.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to continue buying materials such as yarn, fasteners in various sizes, heavy threads, pins and aluminum rings.  She states that she sells them in the country\u2019s capital, where they go for a good price.  On various occasions, she has sent her products to sell in the United States, where her relatives have sent for orders.  She also notes that she has on occasion sewn items such as decorative napkins, or for placing the tortillas, carpets, cushions, tablecloths, etc.\r\n\r\nShe states that she is very happy to work with the financing company because, little by little, she is getting ahead.  She would like to have her own home soon, as they are now living in her mother-in-law\u2019s house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1007619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to make knit bags, caps, purses and sewn handicrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Iveth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":34000,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2989.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3158.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3226.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3296.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3440.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3514.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3590.43},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3667.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3747.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T01:28:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398818,"name":"Ahsan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahsan is a 30-year-old internally displaced person who lives in the Bilasuvar IDP settlement with his wife and two children.

The group consists of three women and three men, all hardworking. Every one of the group members is married and has a family, and every one of them works makes an effort day by day to get ahead. Some sell shoes by mail order, buy raw materials to make embroidery, buy plastic for greenhouses, buy carpentry materials. In summary all of them have activities geared around commerce, and they do them with the goal of making a profit. When they can they help with household expenses and contribute to school costs for the children or with the household pantry. Also, because they don't have fixed employment with salaries and want to invest some of their time in something productive and support their partners, so that they can continue on with all the necessities that they have now, it's worth mentioning that the people of this group are very responsible and hard working, very friendly and conscious of their responsibility in requesting a loan. This undertaking to improve their lives appeals to them. \n\nThe San Pablo community is an area with a lot of vegetation. Furthermore it has a very large reservoir which supplies the necessities of the community in large measure. In San Pablo they count on services like water, clinics, schools, and continuous transport to town. Beyond all that it is a well settled area, and to top it off a beautiful community. \n\nThe group decided to call itself \"Aurora\" because this is the name of one of the people who organized the group. It was the decision of all the group members that it would be a good name to remember that Se\u00f1ora Aurora took on new things that would benefit everyone. This is the second time the group has asked for a loan, however, Aurora decided this time not to ask for a loan, and that is why her name is not among the list of participants.\n\nThe names of the six members are: \n1. Ver\u00f3nica is 29 years old and is asking for this loan to buy men's and women's shoes to sell. \n2. Gilberta is 52 years old and is requesting the loan to buy fabric, thread, yarn and lace to make and sell embroidery. \n3. Librado is 47 years old and requests his loan to buy plastic for a greenhouse for cacti. \n4. J. Felix is 46 years old and is requesting a loan to make fried food. \n5. Tom\u00e1s is 42 years old and is asking for the loan to buy wood for use in his carpentry shop. \n6. Ma. del Carmen is 49 years old and she is asking for the loan to buy cloth, thread, lace and painted napkins to make embroidery for sale. \n\nLibrado is the representative of the group. He is 47 years old and finished elementary school. In his free time he does bricklaying, plumbing and electrical jobs. He has been married for 24 years to Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, who is a house wife. Together they have three children, the oldest of whom is 23 and married, and second oldest is 21, single and working, and the youngest of them is 20 years old and also works. Librado and his wife live in their own home - that is to say, they own it - and they do not pay rent. \n\nLibrado's motivation for joining this group is because he saw a motive to launch a business and so that the other group members, who also need money, can also participate in this undertaking. \"I am a very optimistic person. I like to help people and tell them that when they do their best, everything they want to do is always possible if they look for a way.\" Librado says, \"I do my work in the following way: when I receive money from my loan I am going to buy cactus stalks in town. The rest of the money I am going to invest in building a greenhouse which will be plastic and a supporting frame. Then when I've built my greenhouse I'm going to plant the cacti and fertilize them with cow and sheep dung, which works as a natural fertilizer. And once in a while I will have to water them because they need water, but very little. When they are grown I will cut them and I will take them to the market to distribute to businesses in town - to make back what I'm going to invest, I hope, and it will be well with me.\"\n\nLibrado says that until now he has not had any difficulty completing his jobs; he hasn't had any illnesses and in general things go well for him. \n\nLibrado has very concrete goals in mind. He would like to run his business on a large scale, build a big greenhouse and sell wholesale. He wants to fill his land with cacti and make this job his primary productive activity. \n\n\"It really motivates me that people that don't even know us have the kindness to support us in our businesses. Plus everything will go well for me because I've researched the conditions of the land where I live and if I can plant cacti, this investment will help me give a better life to my family and get daily sustenance,\" comments Librado. \n\nThe loan granted by the institution will be a big help so that this man can accomplish his goals and keep making progress. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1014099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cacti and materials to buy a greenhouse.

She had four children but now only cares for two of them (Jeancarlos and Abel) in her own home, in the town of Cajas.  Ysabel brought up her children on her own as her partner was never around.  Her main business activity, which has helped her make a lot of income, is selling meals from her home.  In her restaurant she cooks homemade creole meals and she also serves traditional, regional meals in the afternoons. \"I always have to pep up my dishes because my customers become tired of them\" she comments happily.  Ysabel's business is doing very well but, as she is a woman with initiative, she also works raising pigs.  She fattens her pigs, then kills them and sells them as 'suckling pig' (a traditional dish in her country).  Many people know Ysabel and they are always placing orders with her.  Her secret is the feed she gives to her animals.  As she has a restaurant it pays to prepare her food every day.  Ysabel would now like to start a business buying and selling animals.  She has already bought a bull which she will fatten and sell for a good price.\r\n\r\nYsabel is a member of 'Mi Banco' community bank and this is her 15th loan from MFP.  She is grateful for everybody's help as she will obtain the loan she needs to achieve her goals.  She pledges to make her repayments on time as the members of her bank are responsible and supportive people.  With your support, Ysabel will invest the money she has requested in buying basic food products for preparing her delicious meals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1015049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy products such as rice, noodles, milk, sugar and mixed veg for preparing her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T04:41:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400051,"name":"Elshad","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Elshad ochen drujelubniy i dobriy chelovek.

They have two children and live in their own home in the district of Pichari. Robert is a mason and has a lot of experience doing this work. Ever since he was very young he was worked in the building trade. He started out working in the city of Lima as a helper and little by little he learned the trade until one day, he was hired as a master mason to construct a 2 story home. This was his first job and it made him very successful. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, Robert lives and works in the district of Pichari. They returned because the social problems they had experienced had settled down. He is still building and also has a small plot of land where he farms cocoa and fruit trees with his sweet wife. They work together to have more income. Robert is happy with the job he has because it provides him with good earnings. In the future he is thinking of opening a grocery store in his home. This is his second loan with MFP and he is committed to repaying it on time. He will use the 4,000 nuevos soles to buy a grinder for work and invest in maintenance of his farm by hiring laborers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1015156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"buy a grinder for construction and hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":279.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":280.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":294.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":297.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":318.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":323.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":335.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":349.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":360.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":374.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":386.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":398.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-21T13:08:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398828,"name":"Adil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adil is 37 years old and is an internally displaced person who lives in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement with his wife and one son.

She is a single mother and has three children to whom she offers love and, above all, a lot of attention. They live together in their own house, which is well constructed. Macedonia, since she separated from her husband, has worried about the well-being of her minor children, to whom she offers much love. Since then she has had to make an effort to advance and she had to find a way to pay the household expenses. Then one day she noticed that little by little new people were coming to her district. Since then she began to add rooms to her house so that she could rent them at an affordable price. She has been doing this for 8 years and feels that her renters are comfortable.

Her adult sons are already independent.\r\n\r\nJuana sells meals such as juanes (rice and pieces of chicken wrapped in banana leaves), tamales, chicken soups and other dishes.

Up to now she works on her own. \r\n\r\nShe considers her business profitable because of the earnings it provides, and the regular clientele that over time, she has learned to win over.

She needed an income to be able to feed them, as the support her husband gave her wasn't enough; and also to help them them have a trade, and give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results, she has plans to continue with her business, and with the profits buy a transportation vehicle to rent out and generate more income for herself.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with the MFP institution.

Alberto hopes to obtain a good yield from his harvest this year.  He is requesting a loan to buy seeds and to pay laborers to sow his corn and beans.  This will help him buy the supplies he needs to ensure his harvest will be on time and to make the most of the rain that falls in May.  His future plans are to improve his home where he lives alone with his mom.  His mom is very elderly and needs a lot of care.  His short-term goals are to use the income from his harvest to buy two baby calves which he will later sell to make additional income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1015815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and pay laborers to sow his corn and beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":346.79,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":173.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":173.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T16:42:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397595,"name":"Tereza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa  habita en la  comarca  llamada Aguas Caliente ubicada en las afueras de Teustepe municipio de Boaco, casada de 44 a\u00f1os de edad tiene tres hijos  de 23 22 y 12 a\u00f1os de edad  respectivamente .Ella empez\u00f3  con su negocio  hace 20 a\u00f1os con un pr\u00e9stamo que le daba un familiar quien le cobraba un inter\u00e9s muy alto despu\u00e9s trabajo con cr\u00e9dito en una instituci\u00f3n que se llamaba     A C J donde fue jefa de grupo solidario de esta manera logro poner su  negocio de pulper\u00eda y venta de ropa ambulante la cual lo realiza con el apoyo del marido.

They live in their own house in the Tapo district in the Tarma province.\r\n\r\nJuli\u00e1n has devoted himself to farming for ten years.  It is what he likes to do.  With the help from his wife he is able to carry out this work with the planting of peas, potatoes, and \u201collucos\u201d (a root vegetable).  \u201cI am doing well in the planting.  I plant peas twice a year,\u201d he says, proud of the quantity of his production.  He harvests around 80 sacks, which he successfully sells at the wholesale market in Tarma.\r\n\r\nHe also has animals; he has three cows, three pigs, and five sheep.  He raises them in order to sell them later.  He previously had some difficulties like the lack of capital to invest in his crops, but thanks to working with MFP he was able to gradually get ahead.\r\n\r\nWith these activities he is able to assure his children and his wife of a decent quality of life with a look towards making progress.  He now is thinking of leasing more land in order to produce more potatoes and peas.\r\n\r\nThis will be his eleventh loan with MFP.  He pledges to make his monthly payments punctually.  He belongs to the R\u00edo Blanco communal bank.  It pleases him to share experiences with his companions who are as responsible as he is.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the loan he will be able to buy one bag of pea seeds.  With the rest he will buy organic fertilizers (farmyard guano) in order to guarantee their growth.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1016844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a bag of pea seeds and sacks of fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T20:58:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398951,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is a single woman.

He is married and has three children (ages 9, 5, and 2).  Carlos works very hard because he wants to protect his family and provide them a better quality of life.  He also takes care of his own home, which he was able to build thanks to a gift of land from his father.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarlos has a job that consists of transporting cargo and passengers within and outside of the city.  When passengers want to reach their destination safe and sound, Carlos offers them a ride.  One of his virtues is that he is very careful.  He has the necessary experience for transporting potential passengers and dealing with any difficulties.  Carlos has been in this line of work for 18 years.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe enjoys his work because it allows him to have time to spend with his family.  In addition, he is able to take his children to school and to different places as needed.  Carlos remembers starting out in this line of work at a very young age.  Over time, he gained experience as a result of the days of work that were sometimes uncomfortable because of the intense heat of the sun or the heavy rains that would inundate some parts of the city.  Carlos hopes to continue working   and supporting his family without problems so that they can grow.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his third loan with MFP.  Carlos is very pleased to know that he will have financial support since he is confident that he will advance his business.  In addition, he promises once again to complete his payments just as he did with his previous loans.  He is grateful to be part of his Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.

She lives here with her two beloved daughters, 21-year-old Yanina and 16-year-old Yuli, who she is devoted to.  Thanks to her perseverance and, above all, the hard work she does, Elizabeth managed to buy a rice-hulling machine.  She has been in this business for 20 years now and it is very easy for her to carry out her work as she really enjoys it.  Her main customers are people from her town who grow rice.  At harvest time they bring their crops to Elizabeth's workplace so that she can hull their sacks of rice.  Elizabeth normally works alone but she had to hire a laborer to support her in filling the grain sacks that mount up.  Over time, she would like to be able to expand her business as it is how she provides for her family, especially for her daughters' education.

He is also kind and chivalrous.  He lives with his partner Juliana who is a housewife and the mother of his three children Juan, Ami and Frank, who are 6, 2 and 1.  They live together in their own home that they bought with their savings.\r\n\r\nFrancisco works as a welder, a trade that he learned on the job when he used to work as an assistant in somebody else's metal shop.  Now he works in a friend's workshop and earns a percentage for the work that he does.  He started out in this business more than seven years ago and, up to now, he has worked in his friend's workshop.  He previously worked as a fish seller which he considered to be hard work.  He decided to change to welding because he saw that it made more profits.  He considers his work to be fairy profitable.  It makes him good money and doesn't take him much time to do.  Before he started out in this business he was experiencing financial difficulties as his previous business did not provide him with good results and he considered it hard going.  He often failed to provide for his family's needs.  However, with his new trade he is now making better profits.  He would like to use them to buy a fast food cart which his partner will work on selling fast food.  In this way, the couple will support each other in covering their household expenses and will both look to make progress.\r\n\r\nThis will be Francisco's eighth loan from MFP.  He is happy and grateful to know that he will continue having a line of credit so that he can make progress in his business.  He feels very comfortable with his community bank as he considers its members to be nice, supportive people.  Francisco will invest the sum of 1,800 soles that he has requested in buying a fast food cart so that he can establish a new business for his partner.  The cart is worth 780 soles.  He will use the remainder of the money to buy the ingredients needed to prepare fast food."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a fast food cart and ingredients for preparing fast food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":269.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":287.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":286.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":308.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":320.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":328.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T02:17:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398104,"name":"Duo Perpetuas Rosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Duo Perpetuas Rosas.\nEste duo esta integrado por do\u00f1a Maria Luisa de 52 a\u00f1os de edad,y tiene ya solo 2 hijos ya a su cargo ella se dedica a la venta de juguetes de paca, tiene ya 5 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a esta actividad,esta solicitando este credito para la compra de mas mercaderia en juguetes de paca,ya que dise que nececita mas capital para trabajar porque sus clientes le piden mas bariedad de juguetes, espera que kiva le pueda ayudar con el credito solicitando,al igual que la siguientes socia esta solicitando este credito para la compra de ropa de paca,y de la misma forma agrandar mas su local.","en":"\u201cPerpetuas Rosas\u201d Duo.\r\n\r\nThis duo is composed of Mar\u00eda Luisa, 52, who just has two children in her care now; she has been selling toys from toy bundles for five years.

Her shop and her sales take place at home where she set up space to tend to customers.  She\u2019s been in this work for a year but she used to have another shop for four years.  She enjoys her work because it leaves her with time to be by her children since she works at home and can watch over them all day; besides, she has good sales and earns good profits.

She shares her life with her partner, living together in the home that they bought together. They also live with their 3 children who are her reason for everything she does. She provides her children with a good standard of education and hopes to provide them with a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda starts work early in the morning when she goes out in search of the region's freshest and best fruits. She heads to the fruit market located in the city centre where she tracks down her suppliers, who always give her their best quality produce. Later, she returns to her home where her clients are waiting to buy from her so that they can give their school-aged children their breakfasts. She works from her own home and her children help her out; her husband works as a transport driver and together they bring a decent wage into the home.\r\nIn all the time that she has been working in this role, she has learned that nothing can be wasted and she makes ice-cream and jams out of the fruits that are too ripe and close to spoiling. She likes her work as it involves her family, who help her out, and after working at her business in the mornings, she has the afternoons free. She hopes to grow her business as she has every wish and desire to exceed her own expectations.\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP, as such she is counting on their collaboration in order to continue working towards her aims. On the other hand, she is also committed once again to fulfilling the repayment schedule just as she did with her previous loan. She is very happy about being a member of her communal bank as the people involved are good, pleasant and very supportive. With the requested loan amount of 1500 NS, she will buy more fruit for her business as the start of the school year is close at hand and she wants to satisfy her clients, as well as buying bananas because the price is starting to rise and she wants to buy a larger quantity to increase her earnings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1017801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a greater range of fruits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":220.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":249.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":263.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":277.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.64},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T12:39:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399151,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is from Sepac Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

She is happy to be able to share a business that benefits so many people.\r\n\r\nMartha enjoys her work because it allows her enough time to be able to do other activities. It generates a good income as there are always customers for her products which she sells to wholesalers. She is eager to continue doing well so she is starting a new business selling food. She doesn\u2019t know much about it yet but is very keen to learn and make progress. \r\n\r\nThis will be her eleventh loan with MFP, and she hopes that with the organization\u2019s help she will be able to continue achieving her objectives. For her part, she promises once again to pay back the money, just as she has with previous loans. She is very happy to be part of her community bank as all the members are friendly, committed people. \r\n\r\nWith the S\/.2,000 loan, Martha will buy materials, ingredients, and supplies to begin her new business selling meals.

He says that they gave the group this name because they invest all of the loans requested in their businesses so that they can give their families a better quality of life.  Tono, as he is known by his community, is 28 years old and single, and has had a garage for 6 years. He says that he learned this business because it has attracted his attention since he was a child. In secondary school he took a mechanical workshop where he learned to repair cars, and because of this he opened his own workshop.  He says that he is requesting this loan to buy tools, and that each tool is quite expensive.  He also says that he rents the land where his garage is located and which he occupies for parking and for overnight vehicle storage.  He says that his goal and his dream is to buy a large piece of land where he can put his garage and where he does not pay rent as this is money out of his pocket.  For this reason he is making great efforts to become known as a good mechanic. The other ten members of the group are also very hard-working and responsible people.

The car will allow him to reduce the costs of his business and increase his family\u2019s income.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1019240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2012-03-07T06:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-06T06:20:04Z","loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harutyun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18870},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":19940},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":19700},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20860},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20680},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":20850},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":21590},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":21640},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":21970},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":21890},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":22930},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":23250},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":23490},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":23770},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":24020},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":24510},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":24810},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25230}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-05T20:44:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399244,"name":"Pauline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pauline is 44 years old and an enterprising business lady.

She loves them very much and they live together in their own home, in the town of Cajas.  Thanks to her constant work Olga has been able to achieve a lot, including opening a grocery business in her own home.  There she sells basic household products and a whole range of different brands and flavors of drinks.  She is the only person who sells these types of drinks so she is well known in her town.  In addition, she also owns a bus with which she provides a public transport system on known routes in the city.  She hires a driver to take care of this business.  However, the business activity that provides her with the most financial satisfaction is making bricks in a factory that she owns.  There she works alongside assistants who she pays according to how much they produce.  She says that she makes an average of 25,000 bricks a month and sells them in a well-known market.  This is where she sees the profits she makes from her work.  Now Olga would like to see her children with a profession and would like them to become independent and strong.\r\n\r\nOlga is a member of the 'Mi Banco' community bank and this is her 18th loan from MFP.
