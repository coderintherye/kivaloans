The clients to the prior business usually came in between 7 pm and 10 pm making it difficult for him to connect home in the late hours. The first loan of US$143 guaranteed by his pastor enabled him to increase his stock of tea leaves for resale. Although profit margins were small he was able to repay the loan timely and to apply for another one. With the second loan of $225 he intends to purchase tea directly from the factory avoiding brokers. This will greatly improve his income by raising margins per 50Kg bag from $ 14 - $21.  We have seen a great change in his life and a turnaround in the family situation. He is able to support his family better and pay three laborers to help his wife in the farm. He looks forward to being able to sell tea as a wholesaler.

jenny is a married woman with four children. She came to Kampala in1997 forcefully when especially her neighborhood homestead burnt down by Kony rebels and people lost their lives. The situation was so scaring and to remain was to loose life. She decided to come to Kampala where she settles at the suburb of Kampala known as Acholi quarters. While in this displaced place life has not been good because the way of earning living was not easy apart from stone quarry which is the only alternative to Acholi people in the suburb of Kampala. <p\/>\r\n<p>But due to God\u2019s will for his People, she joined life in Africa where sign of good life began to appear.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.

She came to Kampala around 2002 after finding that there was nothing possible for her in her home district.<p\/>\r\n<p>While in Kampala things could not come normally. The desire to study and the pressure from burdens due to improper income. She started some causal work to help raise money for fees, rent, feeding and all the requirements needed in life but all the same, it was easy. By good luck, Jennifer got a friend by the names Abalo Florence who introduced her to life in Africa that she joined as a member and find that at Life in Africa; there is a lot of creativeness. Members teach each other how to make crafts out of recycling materials and she too took the idea. She has learnt how to make bracelets, paper beads and other craft products. She is now earning good living.<p\/>\r\n<p>Where Jennifer B. stays at Nakawa quarters Kampala, is near where consumption of fire wood is very high because the nature of business there is local distillation of whisky that there is nothing used other than fire wood.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Very early on, she started small business activities to meet her own needs. As she had very limited means, she chose an activity that requires very few resources: preparing and selling maize porridge, donuts and cake. Later she got married to alleviate her hardship. But she realized later that she had chosen the wrong husband. The man abandoned her with nine (9) children. Staggering under the burden, she can no longer cope and is seeking help. Despite the profitability of her business, revenue is very scanty compared to her household\\\\\\'s needs. To increase the revenue, she got a credit of $150 that she managed very well and paid back successfully. The second credit of $300 gave her a breath of fresh air and allowed her to sell essential products in addition to porridge. \r\n\r\nThe credit of $550 she is requesting will allow her to buy wheat flour, sugar, rice, oil cans and other consumer products.

R. has 25 years of experience selling shoes, clothes, and he started working in Bahia, Ecuador. He worked for a boss who had the idea to work on foot and sell shoes in the local pueblos. After breaking off from this small business, Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, and they followed a similar model from Victor\u2019s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly whichi towns were the most lucrative, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally. Each day they work from 5am until 10pm. They have recently been so focused on sales that they have not had the time to replenish their inventory with new stock, so they sell goods in the morning and then use the proceeds from those sales to buy just enough shoes to still sell in the afternoon. Victor\u2019s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically goes to the small towns and local festivals which occur fairly often. They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained strong over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. \r\n\r\nVictor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.  He is a 48 year-old with four children, who of whom work for the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children. They saved enough money to move out of Victor\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s house, which was putting pressure on everyone. Their new home was made of cane and they slept on the floor. Now, after working hard, they enjoy a house that is made of concrete, and each child has a room of his own. The Riveras are proud to have gotten out of their previouos situation, which was dire poverty. Although they are still poor, they enjoy a standard of living that most do not have in Ecuador. Their wish is to continue growing the business and open a store located next to their house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":7693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Victor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.

is single. He lives with his parents. His father works at a factory and gets minimum salary, his mother is a housewife. The money they both earn is not enough to meet their needs. Valyeryi willingly contributes to the expenses of his family. His primary goal has always been to give his family a better standard of living. After Valyeryi got back from the military, he worked in a firm selling flower seeds and fertilizers. The experience he gained in this work gave him the confidence he needed to start his own small business and master his commercial activities efficiently.\r\n\r\nValyeryi is very hard-working and enterprising. He works in his greenhouses day and night. He always says his work is something that gives him enthusiasm and inspiration, for it brings beauty into the world. In summer, Valyeryi sets up stalls in the open markets of the city selling the flowers and plants he has grown. Usually it provides a seasonal job and a decent salary for one or two free lancers. Valyeryi has succeeded in managing his previous loans in \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d and repaid all of them without any delinquencies. \r\n\r\nValyeryi is eager to access the above amount to buy more flower seeds and bulbs. He is planning to expand the surface he cultivates for greater production. Valyeryi is going to grow potted and cultivated flowers in the greenhouses and sell them in summer. This loan will help him get a wider variety of flowers and a larger quantity of plants. Moreover, the loan will give Valyeryi a chance to improve his greenhouses to protect them against ups and downs of the climate, particularly drops in temperature. Valyeryi will benefit from more consistent financial support because it will strengthen his trade and provide the important profit margin he needs to improve his business.    \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n

His 17-year-old daughter is a handball player. His son is 22, he studies in college to be an IT technician. Sergey\u2019s dream is to open family computer store\/club. <p>\r\n\r\nBefore Sergey started his business, he used to work at a factory adjusting welding equipment. When the factory staff was reduced, Sergey lost his job. He was forced to find another source of income for the family with two little kids. That\u2019s how he ended up at a car repair shop working with a car flattener. In 1994 Sergey decided to start a small business of his own, selling dishware, leather wallets, perfume and souvenirs. The loans he received in \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d helped him reinforce his trade activities, providing necessary resources for his small business. Sergey is very consistent and balanced, he has a good sense of management. That\u2019s why he has succeeded to manage all loans without any delinquencies. <p>\r\n\r\nSergey is applying for a loan to get sufficient capital to increase his inventory and gain extra profits. It will not only help him have enough to maintain his family and cover the increasing demand this Christmas season, but also give their family computer business a good start. In the country where most families still don\u2019t have computers at home and many people go to computer clubs to access internet, Sergey and his son can open a client-friendly internet caf\u00e9 that would provide high quality service to the community. They are planning to rent a facility, do all the necessary remodelling and purchase desktop computers and supplementary furniture. This computer club will not only provide access to computers, moreover, it will offer any kind of IT services and a wide range of computer equipment for sale.

year-old Adalat is a father of 2 children. Adalat is a refugee from the occupied Jabrayil region of Azerbaijan who lives in a worker\\\\\\'s hostel in Sumqayit city. \r\n\r\nIn 2000 he decided to try his hands in small-scale business and started selling greenery right in front of his hostel. Thus he launched greenery sale business.   \r\n\r\nWith this small business and only $200 in working capital, he could hardly meet his family\\\\\\'s needs. To this end in 2004 Adalat borrowed $500 from Norwegian Microcredit. Due to this opportunity he opened vegetable counter in the central market of Sumgayit city, expanded his business and thus considerably improved his welfare. \r\n\r\nToday when his business is a success, this refugee-turned-entrepreneur intends to open a fruit section of his counter, increase his incomes and finally build his own house. Therefore he applies for the loan of $800. In his belief this will enable him to meet his family\u2019s needs better and make his dream for own house a reality.   He looks ahead with hope and thinks he\u2019s in good capacity to repay the loan. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":8232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Adalat will use this loan for opening a fruit counter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Sumgayit city","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":31,"posted_date":"2006-12-23T00:27:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adalat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-01-06T16:18:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-02-06T08:37:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6771,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-03-06T10:31:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9502,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-04-10T04:45:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12701,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-05-08T09:36:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15597,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-06-12T08:15:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":22359,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-07-24T05:33:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34700,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-08-30T09:51:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":48411,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-10-02T12:53:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61959,"comment":null},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-11-06T23:06:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":77341,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T00:38:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":92497,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-01-06T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110320,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2006-12-23T16:18:39Z","paid_date":"2008-01-06T10:21:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":2841,"name":"Gultakin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gultakin was born in 1970 in Kalbacar region Chaykand village.

Gheorgita began working at the Calarasi market in 1992 and has done so ever since, working with other vendors and on her own. In an environment where finding any job can be tough, the market can provide steady work, especially important for a mother of two. She was working at the Lottery booth near the entrance when she noticed the unused space next to it and decided to try opening her own business. Now she can be found at her table every day from early in the morning until mid-afternoon, selling a range of clothing and household goods. Her most popular items are head scarves (worn by most Moldovan women) and shirts. When asked how she decides which types of products to stock, Gheorghita says she always tries to keep track of and act on customer inquiries and demands.

In the small village of Sadova he works hard to care for his bees and to use their precious production as efficiently and creatively as possible. A Peace Corps volunteer originally helped him research and set up the foundation of his project several years ago and Petru has not stopped learning and experimenting since. Right now, for example, he is working on a new system for the wooden frame that holds the beeswax foundation inside the hive. Currently his operation has two branches: honey production and candle making. The former involves much attention to the health of his bees. In the spring and summer he takes his hives to the forest above his town to allow the bees to find nourishment from different varieties of trees as they come into season, thus creating differentiated honeys as derived from certain blossoms (separated according to the time period in which the bees were feeding). The honey is sold at the local markets as well as in stores, but it is difficult in Moldova to have a good and steady income from honey sales alone so Petru realized that diversification was important. The candle making side of the business entails many steps, starting with finding a steady supply of good wax. Petru wants to generate more of his own high-quality wax since the stock he recently purchased was in large part impure and brittle, but doing so will take some time and require expansion; he would like to work up to a larger scale, hopefully with around 100 families of bees. He works with his family, especially with his daughter who loves painting the finished candles with special paints to make them even more ornate, and sells the candles at stores specializing in crafts and decorative goods. Many local churches also buy tall alter candles from Petru since they know that he only uses high quality wicks and that the candles will burn well. Petru would now like to purchase more hives, to buy a stock of sugar-derived nutrition for wintertime feeding and to buy a supply of finer wax to ensure superior candles for his customers to use in the holiday season.

His father is retired, his mother is a housewife. His younger sister is a college student. Anton is the sole breadwinner in the family. Anton is also a college student and he pays his college fees himself. \r\n\r\nAnton is honest and hard-working. He is very creative and full of new ideas. When Anton was working in the sphere of furniture production and assembly, he was dreaming about starting his own business in this industry. However, he didn\u2019t have sufficient capital and he realized he had to provide for his family and cover household expenses. That is why he opened a kiosk selling bakery items. Previous loans in \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped him to buy plastic windows and a door, do all the reconstruction work inside the kiosk, and invest in the inventory.  \r\n\r\nAnton is requesting the above amount to reconstruct his kiosk into a little store and build up a stock of provisions. This loan would give him a chance to buy a larger assortment of goods, such as sugar, flour, vegetable oil, and cereals, which sell extremely well in winter. Anton is also planning to hire a second salesperson providing a stable source of income for one more family in the community. He believes the loan would boost his economic activitity and help him generate more profits. It will not only help him grow his business but also give his family a better quality of life. Anton\u2019s dream is to open a small furniture production factory. He believes financial assistance in combination with his zeal, perserverance and diligent work will someday help his dream come true.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u2013

Married and mother of three children, she is an apprentice dressmaker. The trade has become very competitive, because of the high number of the dressmakers, everyone does not succeed in gaining income from it. Thus, Mrs. A. passes the weeks without being visited by the slightest customer. The living conditions became very difficult in the family because her husband, an apprentice driver is without employment and thus unable to provide for the needs for the children. Conscious of the situation and after doing some market research in her village , Mrs A., decided to launch into the sale of  cement to have a securer source of income. But her means are very limited, she is obliged to supply the retailers, which is not at all profitable. In spite of her passion and her good faith, she is limited in her activities. She then decides to request a financial support to widen her cement trade. \r\n\r\nMrs A. requests a credit of $1000 which will be used by her for the purchase of cement and the hiring of a shop.

is married with eight children. She lives in the village of Sogi is close to the CBD of the capital Apia, located on a thin strip of land which has on one side of it a tidal mangrove swamp. Fishing is the main activity in the village. Some of Aiga\\'s sons fish for crabs in the mangrove. Usually they can make between USD 20 to USD 35 per day and they will catch about 20 to 30 crabs in a week.\r\n\r\nAiga is pictured in front of her house, with some of her children in the background. The house has no walls which is traditional in Samoa. It is elevated with a timber floor. She has accumulated alot of fill which is out of shot.

She learned about buying and selling even while going to school, and so she was able to start her own business selling kids clothing and traditional waist cloths right after dropping out.  Her older sister was already working in this field and helped with her modest display of items for sale.  Business is booming now, but according to customers, the range of choices she offers is limited.   \r\n \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMrs. A. has a plan to diversify her range of goods and to include groceries too, which is a very promising growth opportunity for our locale.  She is requesting a loan of $900 as capital for buying and selling clothing and food items.   \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMadame A.

She has two grown up kids. Her hobby is to take care of her grandchildren. Lyubov is a art school graduate. She is a professional dancing teacher. Lyubov used to give dancing classes for living. However, soon she realized that she lacked opportunities in her field. She borrowed some money and added her personal savings to start her own business. Today she became an entrepreneur running her small kiosk selling toys and games. \r\n\r\nLyubov is very generous. She has a kind and caring heart. Her love for children motivated her to choose this sphere of business. Being a sociable person, Lyubov manages to find common language with every client. Every time you pass by her kiosk you can see her talking to a new person who will definitely end up buying something. Lyubov has worked with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d since 2003. She has repaid 16 loans. She is always telling others about lending services \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d can offer to small business owners.\r\n\r\nLyubov needs a loan of $800 to increase on stock for Christmas season (December 25th \u2013 January 14th  in Ukraine).  She wants to buy stuffed toys, table games, Barbie dolls, puzzles, construction pieces etc. in bulk from wholesale distributors. Lyubov has worked in this business for over 3 years. She knows exactly what kids will like and how to make a child happy. She doesn\u2019t have to advertise her trade stalls because attractive toy displays and bright colors draw potential clients to her kiosk. Being a good steward of the money she receives, Lyubov will manage the loan efficiently and repay it in time. Financial assistance will not only help Lyubov expand her commercial activity, it will also fill so many homes with joy and happy smiles this Christmas season.
