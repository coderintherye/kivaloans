He says the dairy cow will provide milk for use in the hotel and help him pay his children's school fees from its additional income. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he will be focusing on buying a pick-up to transport his produce to the market.\r\n\r\nDaniel says the challenge in farming is a lack of quality dairy breeds and general low produce from the farms. He is full of praise for Juhudi Kilimo for providing agricultural loans to farmers.\r\n

She began this business 30 years ago, when she used to work in a sewing business in the French zone of Barranquilla. Her decision was influenced by the fact that she needed to manage her own time due to her familial responsibilities, especially to her 20 year old son who she has helped to get ahead and who has motivated her to buy a home, applying all her energy to work and saving for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's sixth loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With them, she has been able to improve her living conditions and has also gotten help in supporting her son start up another business. Her biggest challenge was to cover all the costs of her home after she separated from her husband, but she realizes that with time her efforts have been reflected in what she has been able to achieve today with her tenacity and discipline.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Isabel dreams of adding a store to her home, to separate the work space from the family space and give her more peace.  She also works to manage a profit margin of no less than 24% and to make that grow.  Currently Isabel is applying for a Kiva loan that she will use to buy fabric borders that have been offered at a good discount price, and she will take advantage of it to increase her profits on every garment that she makes.

Margarita will also buy compost to fertilize her crops so that they will develop well.

She is a widowed woman that has 3 children of the ages from 11 to 17 years, which she hopes to see become successful professionals and who are her daily inspiration in her work.  Since the year 1998 when she started her business with a loan that her husband took out, she has not stopped for a moment.  She sells clothing for ladies chiefly and, in a smaller proportion, clothes for men and children, which she distributes by means of orders from among her clients.  She offers them a moderate credit so they can agree to buy articles that would not possibly be within their reach with cash.  Currently she is applying for her fourth loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which she will carry out improvements of her housing conditions: steaming and adapting the bathroom and kitchen.  With her previous loan she managed to supply her business with new merchandise, which has resulted in a slight increase in the family income.  Her dream is to manage a stationary business in a commercial location where it would be seen as a great store.  Her most  important challenge is the small amount of working capital that she currently handles, and that many times she does not have enough to respond opportunely to her clients.  In the meantime Marleth continues working to multiply her average net profit margin of 12%.

She has lived there in a 2-room brick house with her family in the area of Rasheed Park for the past 30 years. She is a widow and had a very difficult time after the death of her husband. She relied on house rent income which she used to raise her children. Now her children are grown up and have started working. So Nusrat spends most of her time at home doing her household responsibilities. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of two sons and two daughters. Her elder son has a motorbike rental business and her younger son operates a grocery store in the market. Her daughters stay at home and help their mother in her housework. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the improvement of her younger son\u2019s grocery store business. With the loan, he will buy daily use items such as cooking oil, sugar, salt, etc. which will enable him to make more sales and earn larger profits. He has been doing this business for the past 10 years and Nusrat is hopeful that an investment will bring even  more profits to him and she will be able to save some profits for her daughter\u2019s marriage.   \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application. She has proved herself a responsible client by paying her installments on time in the previous loan year. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Nusrat.

He is married and the father of a family with 8 children, of whom 3 are still in his charge. Manuel is a farmer with 40 years in this activity. Now he plants coffee and raises cattle.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 15 he began helping his father. Manuel studied only to the 4th grade of primary school because his parents were very poor and he was one of 9 children. They couldn't pay for schooling for all the children, so he had to help his father to work and bring food to his home. At the age of 22, he decided to marry but it was difficult. He had to work twice as hard for 2 months to be able to afford a wedding dress for his wife. Then, his father sold him a small piece of land to work and he made it count, with the help of his wife. Later, he sold this piece of land to buy a larger plot and plant coffee, and also, raise cattle. Thus Manuel and his family have survived until the present. He hopes to sell his coffee directly to buyers in the United States.\r\n\r\nManuel requests a loan to maintain his 4.375 acres of coffee, to pay laborers, and to buy manure. This will help him to keep his harvest in good condition, and obtain a better production of coffee. He intends to buy more land in the future for planting coffee, using a highly technical system that will produce organic coffee. Among his short-term  goals is to sow 5.25 acres of beans and 3.5 acres of corn.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":749269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"TO FERTILIZE AND MAINTAIN 4.375 ACRES OF COFFEE TREES","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-04-12T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1172.86,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1172.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":1172.86,"processed_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242752,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-19T13:00:12Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":289685,"name":"Juan Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Juan dedicado al servicio de transporte durante  siete a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s gracias al sacrificio que realizo durante ese tiempo pudo comprarse su propio veh\u00edculo con el cual actualmente se encuentra trabajando y sosteniendo a su familia  con los ingresos que genera.

He is originally from Pueblo Nuevo in the city of Estel\u00ed.  Luis is a farmer by trade.  He started helping his father at the age of 12 and gained more experience ever since.  When he turned 20 years old, he went to work on a vegetable farm where he planted approximately 0.8 acres of tomatoes.  This enabled him to earn some income so that he could continue working. Afterwards he decided to leave Nicaragua to go work abroad in order to continue accumulating capital for his work.  Luis studied through the fourth year of high school, taking courses in computer science and electronics.  However, he decided to work alone in the fields because he could not continue his studies due to a lack of financial resources.  Even though the work is hard, he moves forward with his farm work since planting is one of the activities he enjoys most.\r\n<p>\r\nLuis is requesting a loan to maintain and plant flowering tomatoes.  This will enable him to cover expenses such as labor, gasoline for his motorized plow, supplies, and fertilizers.  He hopes to have a good harvest.  In the future, Luis wants to buy his own land and a house.  His main goal is to achieve the best crop of tomatoes since this is the season for planting vegetables.  He wants to acquire another piece of land so that he can plant more.

Y. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to purchase tools and other equipment to expand the business. The loan will be her third from SEDA.

She lives in her own house with her family in Reque District in northern Peru.  The zone where she lives is rural and does not have the basic service of potable water; it only has electricity.  Water for her consumption comes from a well.\r\n\r\nShe raises livestock like turkeys, chickens and cattle.  She has ten years experience in this line of work.

At the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 2001, Altantsetseg had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make her business more stable. As a result of her hard work, today she has 1,600,000 MNT in her working capital and she sells children\u2019s clothes. \r\n\r\nAltantsetseg is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT).

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20203050013) is a 30-year-old woman who lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, H\u00e0 owns and operates a furniture-making business in the manufacturing sector.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.  H\u00e0 has been engaged in her business for more than 5 years and earns approximately 6,000,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) a month from business activities.\r\n\r\nH\u00e0 joined SEDA in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She successfully repaid a previous SEDA loan of 7,840,000 VND, which was used to purchase tools and other equipment to expand her business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 8,736,000 VND, which will be used to purchase raw materials to expand her product offerings.  This will be her third loan from SEDA.  H\u00e0 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for its Field Partner to allow it to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH\u00e0 Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20203050013) l\u00e0 30 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20203050009) is a 24-year-old woman who lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, U. owns and operates a furniture-making business in the manufacturing sector.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.  U. has been engaged in this business for more than 4 years and earns approximately 6,000,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) a month from business activities.\r\n\r\nU. joined SEDA in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  U. has successfully repaid a previous SEDA loan of 6,944,000 VND, which was used to purchase raw materials to expand her product offerings.  U. is now requesting a new loan of 8,736,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  This will be her 3rd loan from SEDA.  U. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for its Field Partner to allow it to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nU.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Mamajon is 52 years old. He is married and has 3 children. Mamajon is the sole breadwinner for his family, and his only income comes from raising large livestock and selling them at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from farms in the adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n\r\nToday Mamajon is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd is not enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest a loan of 7000 Somoni into his business. In order to obtain this amount, Mamajon has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her first activity was realted to a small business selling merchandise via catalogues, or specialized product guides. Then, inspired by her parents activities, also a part of the Foundation's programs, she added the activity of selling beverages such as beer from a small cooler. She still has the cooler and has added making frozen food. These activities continue generating her income and she dreams of making them grow more every day to continue improving her quality of life. At present, her small freezer is not in the best condition and she needs to replace it soon. That is why she is turning to Kiva loans to buy a new cooler to go from small scale beer selling to providing a larger quantity for stores and other establishments.

Dayra still recalls, when she started up, how they brought merchandise to her house, under a credit arrangement.  She would sell cologne, perfume, clothing.  Now she buys directly, and her earnings are higher, because her prices are lower, and she can choose what she needs, and the quality she wishes to offer her customers.

Dayra recognizes that, with her loans from Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she has gradually been achieving her goals, but through very hard work and strict discipline.  Thus, with her second kiva loan, she will buy cosmetics, women\u2019s clothing, small appliances, accessories, and footwear, which will increase her sales and bring her new customers.

And in one of the most rural areas, Angel and this group of 15 members are taking loans for their businesses, this group is named Desarrollo para el Progreso 1, 2 & 3 (Development to progress).\n\nAngel requires a loan to buy a coconut tree to sell coconuts all over the city and on different beaches. This is his second loan with Esperanza International, and he decided to take out a loan with us because he feels comfortable with the payments and especially because these loans are for businesses. He is very excited to belong to this group of neighbors doing business for the improvement of their families and the community. He will take a step toward having one of his dreams come true \u2014 having his own business \u2014 and he knows that by working hard, he will improve his business and be able to save and provide any help his children require.\n\nAngel says that his favorite thing is to work, especially in the land, by planting different trees and seeding. He hopes that the profit from his business will be enough to buy his own vehicle and to have a business without debts.

Las chacras de Claudia son las mejores y las tiene bien cuidadas, todos los d\u00edas  es la primera en levantarse de la cama, prepara el alimento de sus hijos y enviarlos luego al colegio, mientras su esposo va preparando las herramientas que utilizar\u00e1 durante el transcurso del d\u00eda; Claudia cultiva plantas de caf\u00e9, cacao y plantaciones de barbasco, productos que posteriormente lleva a comercializarlos a los centros de acopio situados en las ciudades de San Francisco y Kimbiri. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la libertad que tiene para pasear por los verdes campos de su poblado, lleva 15 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es cuidar sus cultivos de la plaga de insectos quienes se encargan de da\u00f1ar  los capullos de las plantas. Por lo cual ella solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de insecticidas para luego realizar la fumigaci\u00f3n respectiva y as\u00ed combatir las plagas que aquejan sus cultivos. Con el tiempo, desea comprar m\u00e1s tierras para incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Este es su quinto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, sabe que tiene que pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente si quiere acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito posteriormente.

Con los 3,000 mil nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 insecticidas para combatir las plagas que da\u00f1an sus cultivos. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"34-year old Claudia is a simple, hardworking woman who lives in her own home with her 37-year old husband Benjam\u00edn and their three beloved children for whom she wishes to provide a better future. Her fields are of good quality and well cared for. Every day she is the first person to get up, prepare food for her children, and get them off to school. Her husband, in the meantime, is getting ready the tools needed for the day\u2019s work.\r\n\r\nClaudia grows coffee, cocoa, and barbasco (a native Peruvian plant) which she later sells in the warehouses of the towns of San Francisco and Kimbiri. She enjoys the freedom of spending her days in the green countryside around her home and has been farming for fifteen years. The hardest part of her job is keeping insects away from the fresh growth on crops. For this reason Claudia is asking for a loan to buy insecticide to spray on the plants and keep the bugs at bay.

L\u00ea D., age 28, lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. To make a living, H. operates a furniture making business.

He and his wife have two small children. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services. He wished to help improve his living situation and increase his ability to engage in business activities. H. has successfully repaid his most recent previous loan of 8.288.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand his product offerings.  \r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 9.184.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and employed as working capital.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by this borrower from SEDA. H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\r\n  \r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in the rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20209040036) is a 35 year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 1 school-aged child.  To making a living, H. works in someone else's business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing construction services to local community members.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2.600.000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2009, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to invest in renovating the business.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND which will be used to invest in constructional material to meet the demand of customers.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to supplement the family's income.\n\n\nAbout SEDA:\n\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nH.

Chu Th\u1ecb, age 47, lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. To make a living, L. raises livestock, specifically cattle, to offer for sale. L. has been engaged in this business for over 18 years and earns approximately 2.800.000 VND a month from these activities. She and her husband have one school-aged child.  \r\n  \r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. L. has successfully repaid her most recent previous loan of 8.288.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. L. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business.\r\n \r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in the rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nL.

She has been engaged in her business for over eleven years and earns approximately $38 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Divina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to add capital to her business. \r\n\r\nDivina is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials for nipa production.
