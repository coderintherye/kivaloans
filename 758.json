","en":"Aigul was born in the Kyzyl-Tuu village in the family of shepherds.  All of her childhood was closely tied with breeding livestock because her parents were involved in taking 500-600 small livestock to pasture during the season.  After finishing salespeople training in the capital, Aigul began to work as a salesperson at a store.  She got married in 2009 and, together with her husband, Batyr, returned to her native village in 2010.  During the initial years after the move, Aigul's family experienced difficulties, as they were unable to expand their business and get a job, but, with time, they leased a hectare of land and started to grow potatoes.  Then, to expand her business, Aigul became involved in animal husbandry by buying a cow and selling milk.  The profit from the sales amount to about 4,500 som (KGS) today.  In order to further expand her business, Aigul requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a cow and fodder.  She plans to invest the profits into increasing livestock headcount and to start a large farm in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":983684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle and fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Tuu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aigul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T14:58:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381419,"name":"Renel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Renel has owned a engaged in farming business for eight years.

is aged 64 and has been in active farming for 17 solid years. Her farm currently produces bananas, arrowroots, paw paw, maize and avocados which are all sold within the local market. Her farm is currently run with the help of two farmhands.\r\n\r\nMagdaline had previously acquired two loans of 45,000 KES and 60,000 KES respectively, both of which were repaid promptly. She is currently requesting a loan of 90,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to build a zero grazing unit for her dairy animals at 50,000 KES, and to improve her farming by installing an irrigation system in her farm for her banana plantation, which requires consistent irrigation.

In 1985, after finishing school, she was accepted to the Medical college in the city of Kyzyl-Kiya.  In 1986, when Risbu completed her first year of college, she was stolen to marry (an old tradition of \"stealing brides\" that has existed for a long time and is currently persecuted by law up to a criminal responsibility).  Because of the marriage, Risbu had to stop her education and become a housewife.  Her oldest son, Toktaaly, was born in 1990, and her youngest son, Begaly, was born in 1993.  In 2000, Risbu and her family moved to the Chuysk region (northern part of the country) to the Rovnoye village, where they rented a shepherd's house.  This is when a difficult period for Risbu's family began - her husband did not work, and Risbu became disabled after an operation.  In 2009, Risbu started her own animal husbandry business to provide a source of income for her family after purchasing one dairy cow.  Today, the monthly profit from sales of milk products amounts to about 4,500 som (KGS).  Thanks to hard work and persistence, Risbu and her husband were able to purchase a used car, and Risbu's husband began providing a taxi service.  In order to further develop her business, Risbu requested a loan in the sum of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a dairy cow.  This will allow her to increase milk sales and her profits.  Risbu plans to invest the profits into building a house for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":134.84,"image":{"id":983790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T02:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Risbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3196},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2968},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3045},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3124},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3204},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3287},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3372},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3459},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3548},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3640},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3734},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3423}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.91},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":69.91,"local_amount":3196,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3273.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125493,"comment":null},{"amount":64.93,"local_amount":2968,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3040.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250649,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T10:59:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381476,"name":"Oumar","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur OUMAR est n\u00e9 vers 1972 \u00e0 FARAKOBA.

Petrovka. She was born in the Osh region (south of Kyrgyzstan) in a farming family, and from the early years was involved in growing fruit and vegetables that were then sold at the local market. At the same time the family raised calves, sheep and goats for sale, and this constituted their main source of income.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Aida graduated from hight school and began to study for a job as a seamstress. Upon completing her studies, she worked for two years in the \"Ak-Kuu\" sewing factory. Over time, her close relatives began relocating to the Chuisk region in the north of the country. This was caused by the fact that in the area where they had lived, very little land was allocated per family member - a family would have 6-10 hundredths of a hectare (roughly one quarter of an acre), which didn't allow to produce sufficient harvest. Meanwhile, agriculture was the main source of income in the countryside where manufacturing and industry were not developed.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Aida's family moved to the village of Petrovka in the Chuisk region, where they live to this day. Having moved to this new location, the family experienced many difficulties - living in a rented apartment, they engaged in farming, cultivating watermelons, peppers and tomatoes. After two years, Aida's family could finally buy a house. Today, Aida is engaged in raising cattle - she keeps two cows and sells the milk to producers of dairy products, which brings her around 10,000 som per month. In order to expand her business, Aida has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase more cattle. Aida plans to use her revenues to repair the house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":983824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Petrovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T11:25:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381499,"name":"Moureen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moureen is a mother of 3 children, aged between 11 and 16 years, all in schooling.

At 29 years old, he has managed a business of fruit cultivation for ten years.  Thanks to the business he generates the necessary income to pay for the household expenditures in which he lives with his wife and his four-year-old son.  He has experienced great difficulties in his life and he aspires for his son not to suffer the same circumstances.  This is why he works hard everyday so that his son will have a stable economic future and can obtain the best education possible.  Thanks to his good work, his business has had large orders placed by his customers therefore he has had to hire more workers to meet the large orders placed by his customers.  Since his customers pay him some months after placing the orders, he is looking for a loan that will allow him to pay for the labor contracted and to buy inputs required such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.  He aspires that with his loan he can pay these expenses without having to wait for his customers to make their payments and in this way not have to stop the current rhythm of production of his business.  He says that if his business continues with the current rhythm of production, he will be able to increase considerably his income and in this way fulfill his big dreams of giving the best quality of life to his son and his wife and buy land to cultivate his fruits and in that way not generate so many expenses from the

Margarita and her husband support their son. Margarita started to work on her parents' crop fields at a very young age, and now, she is an expert in cultivation. She is a farm worker who grows coffee plants. She has been working for over 10 years on her own fields, and during the harvest, she has the support of day laborers so that they can pick the crops at a much faster rate. What she likes most about her job is harvesting because she feels compensated for all those months of arduous labor with high-quality produce. She considers the most difficult aspect of her job to be transporting the produce from her farm to the stockpile centers located in the city of San Francisco, where they offer the best prices for her produce. Her difficulty is not having enough income to pay the day laborers in advance, which is why she turns to MFP for a loan. This will be her first loan, and she knows that it will help her a lot with her work. With the 1,000.00 PEN, she will hire day laborers who will help her with the weeding and harvesting.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":984115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day laborers.

Al principio Nora Elena tuvo que superar grandes adversidades como la de conseguir un proveedor de calidad y de buenos precios, pero a Nora Elena no la aplac\u00f3 nada y consigui\u00f3 un excelente proveedor con excelentes precios. Ahora, Nora Elena comercializa sus productos por las tiendas de su sector y a algunos particulares les vende unas cantidades peque\u00f1as, a tal punto que a Nora Elena le hacen m\u00e1s pedidos de los que puede producir. Es por esto que Nora Elena comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s moldes y m\u00e1s materia prima para la producci\u00f3n de sus chocolates, sin embargo, actualmente no tiene el capital disponible para ello puesto que sus clientes le pagan a cr\u00e9dito, por lo que Nora Elena aspira a que con un pr\u00e9stamo pueda adquirir los moldes y la materia prima que necesita y su negocio siga creciendo para que genere mas ingresos. \n\nNora Elena tiene un gran sue\u00f1o y es el de tener una gran f\u00e1brica de dulces, y que su hijo de 10 a\u00f1os pueda heredar todo lo que ella con tanto esfuerzo ha buscado. Adem\u00e1s, Nora Elena aspira a generar empleo muy pronto, y contratar a personas de bajos recursos que requieran de unos ingresos, as\u00ed le mejorar\u00e1 la calidad de vida tanto a su hijo como a las dem\u00e1s personas que lo necesiten.\n","en":"The best way to describe Nora Elena is \"entrepreneur.\" Her sister-in-law taught her to make chocolate candies and Nora Elena saw a great business opportunity, so she began to make chocolates and found stores in her area where she could sell them. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Nora Elena had to overcome great adversities, such as finding a supplier with quality goods and good prices, but Nora Elena refused to give up, and found an excellent supplier with excellent prices. Now Nora Elena markets her products in the local stores and sells a few to individuals, to the point where Nora Elena has more orders than she can fill. This is why Nora Elena wants to purchase more molds and raw materials for producing her chocolates, however right now she doesn't have the necessary capital for this since her customers pay her on credit. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Nora Elena's goal is to acquire the molds and raw materials she needs, and to continue the growth of her business in order to generate more income. Nora Elena's grand dream is to have a large chocolate factory, and for her 10 year old son to be able to inherit everything she has built through so much effort. In addition, Nora Elena hopes very soon to create jobs, and to hire people of little means who need some income. In this way she will improve her son's quality of life, as well as that of other people who need it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":29.98,"image":{"id":984145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase molds and raw materials for making chocolates","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Tamesis","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":54501},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":56035},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57612},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":59234},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60901},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62615},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64378},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66190},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68053},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":69968},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":71938},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":73962},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":76044},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":78185},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":80384}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.98,"local_amount":54501,"processed_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":55095.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362173,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T13:04:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381663,"name":"Marddy Elieth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Marddy de profesion estilista,  poco realiza sus trabajos, ya que ahora labora en ventas en un cafetin en donde venden variedad de alimentos y golosinas, ubicados en una cotran.\nDesde hace a\u00f1os es madre soltera, de una hija el cual cursa la secundaria, tambien tiene el ingreso del alquiler de cuartos, el cual se ayuda en su economia.

She would also like to have business premises which are separate from her house, so that she can work more comfortably.  Jacqueline lives with her husband and her two children who are 8 and 2 years old.  Her dreams, on a personal level, are to become well known in her business and for her business to make her more profit so that she can provide her family with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nJacqueline is happy and grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza have given her as it will allow her to invest in her business.  She says that her community bank is responsible.  \r\n\r\nOsorno is a city which is located in the southern part of Chile, in Los Lagos region.  It is an important agricultural center which is known as Chile's 'homeland of milk and meat'.  Chief among its farming activities is the production of wheat and oats, cattle raising (both for meat and milk) and the manufacture of farming equipment.  Osorno is home to the only soccer stadium in Chile to have a roof: the 'Rub\u00e9n Marcos' Municipal Stadium.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1799.78,"image":{"id":984092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Osorno","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T23:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1292580,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":80216},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88032},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":88875},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89724},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":90574},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":91439},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":92320},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":93192},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":94088},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":94982},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95894},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96804},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":97729},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":98711}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.8},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1053.56,"local_amount":528860,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":530258.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180833,"comment":null},{"amount":746.22,"local_amount":374582,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":375572.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315291,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T05:17:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381687,"name":"Naftaly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naftaly owns a mobile money transfer shop; the business has been in operation for one year.

secundaria. Alicia como buena peruana le encanta el conocido platillo \u201cArroz con Pollo\u201d, ella nos comenta que no hay nadie que la pueda igualar en la preparaci\u00f3n.\n\nAlicia es muy buena cocinera y trabaja vendiendo uno de los platos bandera de nuestro pa\u00eds El Ceviche, trabaja alrededor de 7 horas diarias; ella vende su producto en un triciclo al cual le ha adaptado un mostrador para colocar all\u00ed el ceviche y mantener la comida con higiene, tiene muchos clientes puede atender en un d\u00eda alrededor de 30 clientes y a veces tanta es la acogida que se agota muy r\u00e1pido y muchos clientes se quedan sin ser atendidos.\n\nActualmente Alicia est\u00e1 muy agradecida con los prestatarios Kiva ya que gracias a su ayuda ella podr\u00e1 renovar su triciclo en el cual labora y tambi\u00e9n comprar uno nuevo, para que su hija tambi\u00e9n la pueda ayudar en la venta del producto, con esta mejora podr\u00e1 tener mayores ingresos ya que desean ambas ahorrar el suficiente dinero para que puedan cumplir uno de los sue\u00f1os m\u00e1s grandes que tiene Alicia y es: Darle la carrera de Enfermer\u00eda T\u00e9cnica a su hija\u201d y por el cual Alicia no descansara hasta ver hecho realizad su sue\u00f1o ya que desea que su hija sea mejor que ella.\n","en":"Alicia is a very tenacious woman who has worked hard and sacrificed a lot in order to provide for her 15-year-old daughter who is currently in the fourth year of her secondary education.  Owing to circumstances beyond her control, Alicia was left alone shortly after her daughter was born.  Alicia is very happy in spite of the setbacks that she has suffered.  She would have loved to have studied to become a nurse but, owing to her parents' limited financial resources, she was only able to study up to the fourth year of her secondary education.\r\n\r\nLike all good Peruvians, Alicia loves the well-known dish 'arroz con pollo' (chicken and rice).  She tells us that she has no equal when it comes to preparing this dish.  Alicia is a very good cook and her business is selling one of our country's most important dishes: 'ceviche' (a marinated seafood dish).  She works around 7 hours a day and sells her food from a three-wheeled vehicle to which she has added a counter where she can place the ceviche and keep it in hygienic conditions.  She has many customers.  Every day she is able to serve approximately 30 customers and sometimes the food is so well received that she runs out very quickly and many customers are unable to get served.\r\n\r\nAlicia is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to renovate the three-wheeled vehicle from which she works and also buy a new one so that her daughter can help her sell her food.  This improvement will enable her to make more income as both she and her daughter want to save up enough money to fulfill one of Alicia's biggest dreams which is to enable her daughter to study for a degree in nursing.  Alicia will not rest until she has seen her dream come true as she wants her daughter to do better than her."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":48.14,"image":{"id":981638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

What she likes the most about her job is the freedom that she has working on her crops, since she can enjoy their green fields freely.  She has been doing this activity for 34 years, and she thinks that the most difficult part of the job is taking care of the crops when they are plagued by insects that afflict her plants.  In the future, she plans to buy new lands in order to increase the crop.  This will be her 14th loan with MFP.  She has been very punctual in the payment of her dues, and she hopes to do now also.  With the 3,000 nuevos soles, she will buy more coffee seeds to be cultivated later and make a good profit from their fruits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":984317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":" buy coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T04:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T11:24:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381714,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Luisa de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, es comerciante y su marido es el se\u00f1or Sergio de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, quien es chofer de una empresa de ventas de materiales de construcci\u00f3n.

After finishing school, she helped her family on the farm, as there could be no talk of further education at that time. The main source of income for the family was growing of rice, work with livestock and field crop cultivation. \r\n\r\nMarrying a fellow villager, the young family was working in the field, growing rice as well. 28 years old went by, and the family went through many difficulties. It became harder and harder to live in the native village, the land was not enough for everyone, and Ashirgul and her husband were by this time raising eight children. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, the family decided to move to the Chuy valley (northern part). From their accumulated funds, the family bought a small house. The four sons helped the father with farming. Ashirgul grew vegetables on a plot of land, and sold the harvest at the market. Thanks to the income from the field crop cultivation, the family was able to buy a cow at the end of 2000. At present, Ashirgul and her family work 8.5 hectares of rented land, where they grow onions and other vegetables, and the farm has two dairy cows. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further expand her business, Ashirgul turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of fertilizers, because this raw material is cheaper in winter, and in the plating season the price rises sharply. In the future Ashirgul dreams of opening her own mini-farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":984739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alekseevka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T21:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashirgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T03:17:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381817,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.97,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a stock for wheat flour and sugar for her hotel","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.97,"local_amount":3512,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3568.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263368800,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T20:45:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381818,"name":"Geoffery","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geoffrey is 43 years old a mixed crop farmer, he is married to Winnie who is a farmer.
