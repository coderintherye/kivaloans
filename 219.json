Sanjar is 26 years old, married and has one child. His goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business activities by offering better service to his customers. His dream is that God will provide him with a long life so he can get ahead and fulfill his goals. He is a taxi driver and travels through the streets of Penjikent, Tajikistan in search of customers. He has owned his business for the last two years. Currently Sanjar\u2019s car needs repairs, and he wants to borrow $1,500 for 12 months. The financing will allow him to repair his vehicle and also buy parts he needs, including new tires. Sanjar thanks Kiva and all lenders who make this help possible.      \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is home to a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Y. is 41 years old. He lives in Penjikent town. He is married and has four children. Uktam processes and sells raisins in the central local market. He purchases raisins from local farmers wholesale and, after processing, sells them to his customers. Because he buys his goods wholesale, his prices are lower than regular market prices. He offers a wide assortment of goods for clients of different means. All this allows Uktam to make his business quite successful and provides a stable income for the family. Currently, he needs a loan of $800 to buy supplies so that he can continue to offer a good product to his customers. Uktam expresses his gratitude for everyone who is supporting him.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/p>\r\n<p>Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His parents taught him how to get by as an agriculturist, and he learned very well. Now that he is the father of a family he still works as an agriculturalist. Thanks to his parents Temurdjon now has the opportunity to move forward as a farmer, and he hopes to increase his agricultural products so that he can provide his loved ones a more promising life. \r\n<P>\r\nDespite being a good agriculturalist and worker he needs help to move forward and improve his production. This is why he is asking for a loan, so that he can buy more of the seeds and fertilizers he needs, which are very expensive, but without them his production will not improve. With the part of the loan he will also buy young cattle. You can help Temurdjon keep moving forward with his development plans.    \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He tells us that he comes from a farming family and that he does very well financially because he takes good care of his land.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ram\u00f3n believes that the success of his business is because his main consumers are farmers and because he generally works on the highways where the large farms and villages are located and with the small farms, located far from the city and therefore the people do not have easy access to stores and that is the reason why Ram\u00f3n takes his merchandise to the area and sells it fast. Therefore he wants to buy a vehicle to be able to move around faster and more comfortably. He has 4 loans with MFP and he likes to work with his group as all the members get along well and are responsible with their payments. The requested money will be invested in buying more veterinarian medicines and garments to increase sales.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":321578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-21T17:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":378.24},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":390.49},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":408.99},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":425.34},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":439.93},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":457.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.82},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.82,"local_amount":378.24,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":380.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596278,"comment":null},{"amount":128.86,"local_amount":390.49,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":392.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990558,"comment":null},{"amount":134.97,"local_amount":408.99,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":410.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211669,"comment":null},{"amount":140.36,"local_amount":425.34,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":427.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641190,"comment":null},{"amount":145.18,"local_amount":439.93,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":442.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080630,"comment":null},{"amount":150.81,"local_amount":457.01,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":459.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996755,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-22T01:38:56Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109296,"name":"Soledad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Soledad tiene 29 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su pareja, quien trabaja como operador de m\u00e1quinas pesadas y tienen 2 hijos que est\u00e1n estudiando, la casa que habitan es propia.

Her children are all now independent and no longer live with her. Saturnina lives in Atalaya, a small jungle village on the Carbon River that serves as the main entry point into Manu National Reserve, one of Peru's biggest tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nSaturnina runs a very small neighborhood grocery store in the Atalaya, where she sells basic food supplies, drinks, coca leaves and canisters of natural gas (used to power gas stoves). Atalaya is the starting point for tourist boat expeditions into Manu National Reserve so, though it is a very small town, there are always many people passing through. Saturnina, or \u201cSatuca\u201d, has had her store for the past three years, and has been a member of the Arpia de Atalaya Village Bank for almost as long.

She resides with her sister and children in Sanoubougou I, a working-class district of Sikasso City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Having lacked the chance to continue with her schooling due to societal reasons, she was soon introduced to income-generating work, notably buying and selling bed sheets, children's clothing, Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), embroidered fabrics, etc.  She is in high demand by her customers (composed essentially of women) for the quality of her products.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about doing better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  After two solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area (Association JEKAFO de Sanoubougou II) and two individual loans, all correctly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.  This loan will be used to buy four dozen outfits for children, six sets of bed sheets, four outfits of embroidered fabrics, and bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>.  Supplies are gotten in Bamako, and sales are made at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, while going door-to-door.  Her customers are composed essentially of civil servants and private company employees of Sikasso.  \r\n\r\nShe envisions using this loan to realize a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":321654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy bed sheets, cloth, embroidered fabrics, and children's clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nouke\u00efssa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":51800.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020267,"comment":null},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":25900.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243022,"comment":null},{"amount":53.15,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":25900.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678833,"comment":null},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25900.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112632,"comment":null},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25900.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028199,"comment":null},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25900.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873536,"comment":null},{"amount":53.09,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":25900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763279,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-01T14:14:12Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109342,"name":"Hannah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hannah A. started her fish sales four years ago at Dorma in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana.

Este es su 4to pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y lo que le gusta de trabajar en su banco comunal es que todos sus compa\u00f1eros y compa\u00f1eras de grupo son cumplidos con sus pagos y muy organizados para realizar las actividades se\u00f1aladas por su asesor de cr\u00e9dito. El dinero que viene solicitando es para comprar m\u00e1s pescado e incrementar sus ventas y ganancias.","en":"Uldarico is 49 years old and lives with his wife, Flor, who helps him with his business.

She always tries to lift the spirits of those who are dear to her and help them get ahead and reach their goals.  Gladys and her husband are examples of perseverance.  They have been able to get a house so they can give their children a secure place to live. \r\n\r\nGetting married has not stopped Gladys from working in the field that has given her much satisfaction since she was a young woman.  She studied cosmetology and has developed professionally in this field for ten years.  She has a place in the local market where she works every day from ten in the morning until ten at night.  Luckily it\u2019s close to her home so she can fulfill her roles as mother and wife.  She always tries to distribute her time adequately so as not to neglect any of her activities.  But there are times when her job is very busy and she needs time to finish serving her clients.  This is why she began to fix a space, which is near completion, in her house for a salon.  She will move into her new home salon with the goal of having her family\u2019s support, as well as not having to pay rent for the space in the market.  \r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP and she hopes to continue working with the same responsibility that she has so far with her group.

So she has become an option for people who can't pay much for medication and can't move far to get them. She wants this business to grow up to be a pharmacy and she would like to become a certified pharmacist. \n\nPlease help us to continue supporting this Kiva loan. \nThank

If this were not the arrangement, Nelly would not be able to enjoy the company of her children, who also help her attend to clients when she needs to leave the house.  Even though the business is going well, Nelly stills thinks about the future, and she has a goal to increase her business this year by adding a small library.  Nelly found out about MFP 5 years ago, and this is already her 10th loan.

Purchasing a home has been one of her greatest achievements, and now her three children have a place to establish themselves. To increase her income, Rita began to sell construction materials 6 years ago, and became the business manager three years ago. In order to improve every day, Rita strives to provide full-time attention, because the business is located in her house, which allows her to manage the business without neglecting the care of her children. \r\n\r\nBut in recent months, the price of raw materials has increased, which reduced the supply of her business.  However, Rita tries to buy in small quantities so that she does not risk losing her investments to her competition. This is Rita's thirteenth loan with MFP, and she feels that the 7 years working with her partners have passed very quickly.  Nevertheless, Rita has gained considerable achievements due to her good work and commitment to the institution. Rita is asking for 1500 Peruvian Soles to invest in the purchase of more materials, in order to meet outstanding orders placed by different clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":321769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"To purchase raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-21T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":226.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":232.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":242.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":255.47},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":277.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.4},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.98},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.16},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.4,"local_amount":226.2,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":229.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596292,"comment":null},{"amount":77.38,"local_amount":232.14,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":235.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990572,"comment":null},{"amount":80.98,"local_amount":242.94,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":246.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211683,"comment":null},{"amount":85.16,"local_amount":255.47,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":259.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641204,"comment":null},{"amount":88.71,"local_amount":266.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":270.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080644,"comment":null},{"amount":92.37,"local_amount":277.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":281.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996769,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-22T03:43:30Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109400,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa es una mujer de 47 a\u00f1os, desde que contrajo matrimonio se dedic\u00f3 en brindar las mejores atenciones a su esposo y sus 8 hijos, quienes en su mayor\u00eda ya est\u00e1n casados y ahora s\u00f3lo vive con los tres \u00faltimos.

It is a large neighborhood on the northern limit of Santo Domingo. The brand new Santo Domingo Metro (subway train) has a station right at the entrance of Guaricanos; however, modern improvements haven't reached many of our borrowers' homes. All services, especially water, are scarce. Finding employment is difficult, which is why many people, especially single mothers like Nereida P., find that they need to put their skills to work in order to support their families. Nereida is thirty-six years old and has two children. She didn't complete middle school, but went to beauty school and received a certificate in beauty culture. She set up a salon where she works alone. Peak days are Saturdays and Sundays. She explains that things are not easy lately. \"People come less often than before,\" she points out. Even so, she's been able to build a faithful clientele that will still come to get their hair done at least once a week. Nereida knows they pay not only for the service, they also pay to have HER provide the service. She will use this loan to buy specific hair products so that she can offer \"special services\" to her customers. When you wash hair with brand name products you can charge more, and Dominican women are willing to pay well to have their hair well taken care of. She will also buy a few new brushes, rollers and pins. This beauty salon is this inspiring young woman's sole source of income. Please help us continue to support her and her work with this Kiva loan.

Ever since she was very young she has enjoyed taking care of the household chores.  Then her mother encouraged her to learn to cook and over time she realized that it was a gift that she had, most of all because of the delicious seasonings she has.   Yavi does the shopping every day in order to prepare the various dishes requested by her lodgers who are working on various construction sites.  In spite of having difficulties with some of her customers making their monthly payments, Yavi manages her money properly with the aim of saving some money and being able to achieve her dream of opening a restaurant in her house.  This would increase her income without having to make deliveries to various locations in order to sell her meals.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and during her time with her communal bank, she has been taught teamwork and how to be properly organized to meet one's objectives.

El credito tiene como fin el inyectar capital de trabajo para su taller de confeccion y para su tienda de abarrotes lo cual le generara mayores ingresos. Juvenal ha tenido un buen comportamiento de pagos en todos sus creditos demostrando responsabilidad y organizaci\u00f3n.","en":"At age 57, Juvenal is married to Cinda and they have three children, and none of them are dependent upon their parents since they are older now. Juvenal has his own home which is well-located on an asphalt avenue and in a populated area between Villa 1ro de Mayo and La Pampa de la Isla. In their house, they have a grocery store that is well-stocked and well-located since it lies on a corner and visible to the neighborhood. Juvenal is a veterinarian by profession and has his small office in his house. In addition to these activities, they are also making clothing for women in collaboration with one of their daughters, who carries the products to the border. In their neighborhood they have competition for their grocery store, but there is no other vet nearby. The loan's goal is to increase working capital for their clothing shop and for their grocery store, which will generate the most income. Juvenal has had a good record of making payments in all his loans demonstrating responsibility and organization.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":321841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-05-22T05:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juvenal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":58.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":59.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":64.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":65.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":70.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.72,"local_amount":52.72,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52955795,"comment":null},{"amount":54.04,"local_amount":54.04,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":54.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63173090,"comment":null},{"amount":55.39,"local_amount":55.39,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":55.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73598579,"comment":null},{"amount":56.77,"local_amount":56.77,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":56.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87034156,"comment":null},{"amount":58.19,"local_amount":58.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":58.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946377,"comment":null},{"amount":59.65,"local_amount":59.65,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":59.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788161,"comment":null},{"amount":61.14,"local_amount":61.14,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":61.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678344,"comment":null},{"amount":702.1,"local_amount":702.1,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":702.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072901,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-24T11:52:53Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109439,"name":"Efren","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Efren S. vive junto a su familia en la comunidad de villa carmen caluyo provincia aroma, desde hace 43 a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s.

L. is from the town of Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling frozen meat products. Rosita earns an income of 6,000 Php monthly.\r\n\r\nRosita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP (US$225), which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be taken out by Rosita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines committed to serve the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the town of Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. \r\n\r\nLorna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP (US$150), which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be taken out by Lorna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines committed to serve the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is from the town of Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. \r\n\r\nGemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP (US$125), which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. The loan will be a big help in providing the necessities of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines committed to serve the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a retail business selling variety of cooked snacks like grilled meat. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from her snack vending.\r\n  \r\nVirginia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP (US$150), which will be used as additional working capital. This loan will be taken out by Virginia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines committed to serve the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. \r\n\r\nRubilyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rubilyn is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP (US$250), which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be taken out by Rubilyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines committed to serve the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Aval is 46 years old. He is married and has four children. After getting married, he arduously dedicated himself to the livestock business. When he recognized the need to invest in his work, Aval decided to construct a place to start an animal breeding business. He started only with one cow, but now he has two cows and three sheep.\r\n\r\n<P>Now, Aval wants to expand his business and to buy two cows. Trustingly, he has sought a loan from IMON, believing that his loan request will be granted, and he will be able to move forward in his work. Your support will really help to Aval and his family to get ahead.<\/P>      \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His marriage has been blessed with 2 children, aged 9 to 14 years; they are Bifeni and Yosafat. As a farmer, Yustinus is only able to generate income in a small amount. The income is unstable, depending on the season and crops. To generate money, Yustinus usually sells bananas and areca nut in the market. His wife also helps him to generate money by selling vegetables. The hardship that Yustinus faces in financing his family motivates him to find another alternative to support his family life. This is the reason why Yustinus is intereseted in joining TLM Cattle Fattening Program. <p>\r\n\r\nYustinus is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,200,000 from TLM to buy cattle to be fattened over a 12 month period.

Supporting 4 children at school with an unstable income is not easy for Margen and his wife. They can only eat rice with salt without any side dish when the income generated is small. Margen works hard to generate as much income as possible to meet his family needs and his children's education needs.

Most of the community members living in this area lean upon the agricultural sector to support their lives. \r\n\r\nOliftataf 44-A is led by Fret P., a 46 year old man. Fret is married and has 4 children. The children are: Mayesti, who is 19 years old and studies at the university in Jakarta (supported by Fret\u2019s relative); Randy, who is 13 years old and in the 1st year of Junior High School; Desy, who is 9 years old and in the 4th grade of Elementary School and Tomy, who is 7 years old and in the 1st grade of Elementary School.  \r\n\r\nFret has a background as a poor farmer who usually sells his crops (bananas, coconuts and areca nuts) to meet his family's needs and to finance his children's education. His wife always helps him in supporting their family. Working as a farmer is challenging work. The main challenge for Fret and many other farmers in this area is the low price offered for the crops that they sell. As a result, he is only able to generate a small income from his crops. It is not easy for Fret, because he has to finance the education of three of his children. This situation and a hope for a better future for his children motivate Fret to find a way to increase his income. He then heard about the TLM Cattle Fattening Program and became interested in joining the program.\r\n\r\nTogether with 7 other farmers in Riumata Village, they formed a group to apply for a loan from TLM. Fret is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,500,000 to buy cattle to be fattened over a 12 month period. He hopes that this loan will help him improve his living standard.

He leads a group of eight farmers called Oliftataf 44-B in Riumata Village in the Kupang District of the East Nusa Tenggara Province. Just like many other communities living in rural areas, the community of Riumata Village also relies on agriculture for income to fulfill each family's needs.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Yerdi is married with two children. Ari is seven years old and attending the first grade of elementary school, and Natalia is five years old and in Kindergarten. To earn money, Yerdi usually sells his crops in the traditional markets. The nearest market is about 20 minutes drive from his village. The road in Riumata Village is bumpy with many holes and it's hard for public transportation to serve in this area in the rainy season.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though he has worked hard, Yerdi feels that his income is not enough to fulfill his family needs, and it is usually unstable. He really wants to provide nutritious food to his children because they are in a growth period and need adequate nutrition. He dreams of sending his children to the university so they will have a bright future. Not many children in this area are able to have a better education because of their parents' economic difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This situation drives Yerdi to increase his income with another business by joining the TLM Cattle Fattening Program. By joining the program, he will be able to earn a profit from selling fattened cattle. Yerdi is requesting a loan from TLM for IDR 3,400,000 to buy cattle to be fattened in 12 months. The other members of Oliftataf 44-B are also requesting loans to buy cattle to be fattened.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Note: Yunus A. and Anderias P. were replaced by their family members in the group picture.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":322013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang, Riumata","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-05-19T11:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yerdi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yunus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barnabas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anderias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fransina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melkiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jublina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27400000,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":27400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2311.5,"local_amount":23900000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":24030129.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144788477,"comment":null},{"amount":338.5,"local_amount":3500000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-26T08:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3519056.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151970090,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T03:39:50Z","paid_date":"2010-08-26T08:52:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109494,"name":"Marievic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Marivic D. is 32 years old and resides in Hinaplanan, Claveria, Cagayan de Oro  City.

Parmon is 53 years old. He is married and has six children. Parmon is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults thanks to his example.\r\n\r\nParmon is a manufacturer. With the help of his son (pictured), he produces wooden doors and window frames. His workshop is located in his house. Working in this business for 39 years, Parmon became a rather experienced master and now he has apprentices.\r\n\r\nBy producing goods of good quality at acceptable prices, Parmon has many customers. He sells the doors and window frames from his house. At the same time there is a trading place located in the local market.\r\n\r\nIn general, Parmon\u2019s business is very successful and generates stable incomes for the family. Now Parmon is planning to purchase the additional equipment required for expansion of his business. With this purpose in mind he requests $3000 for the term of 12 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Not having gone to school due to societal reasons, this woman was introduced to an income-generating business, the dyeing of cloth.  She learned this trade in Bamako (capital of Mali) from ANTOU, a local celebrated dye expert.  \r\n\r\nMariame enjoys a solid reputation in this business and receives many orders, especially for ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, holidays, etc.).  But her own resources cannot allow her to meet the demand.  And so, she's requesting a collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso, with which she is on her fourth individual loan, after having correctly repaid all the preceding ones.  She intends to buy five bolts of white damask fabrics, ten bags of caustic soda, and ten containers of dyes of different colors.  Supplies are gotten from wholesalers in Bamako for her raw materials (white damask, caustic soda, and dyes).  The white damask is put into different colors and then sold, either in cash or credit transactions, to customers composed of women in her area. \r\n\r\nWith this fourth loan, she intends to realize an average monthly profits of 300,000 francs CFA that she'll use essentially for her personal expenses, for helping to cover family expenses by helping her husband, for making loan interest payments, and for bolstering her dye business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

With the current loan, he intends to buy piston rods, camshafts, pistons, rims, etc.  The merchandise (spare parts) comes from automobiles disassembled locally and is resold in a store located within his garage. \r\n\r\nHe envisions using this loan to realize a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment his working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in his business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":322168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy used spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243024,"comment":null},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112634,"comment":null},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873538,"comment":null},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152085,"comment":null},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021250,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-15T03:25:50Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109582,"name":"Juneper","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juneper F. is 27 years old and is married.

Thus, she decided to become specialize in making and selling \"djafarana\" powder about 17 years ago.

After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association of her area, she is on her second individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  With the current loan, she intends to buy three sacks of millet, eight sacks of \"djafarana\" seeds, and 30 kg of shea nut butter.  Supplies of the seeds, millet, and the butter are gotten in towns surrounding Sikasso City (Loulouni, Lobougoula, Gnangasso, etc.) by special order. \r\n\r\nHer business cycle is very rapid, and she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used to ensure that certain expenses are covered, to help her husband support the family, to make loan interest payments, and to

He opted for commerce in clothing, more precisely in second-hand clothing, a business he learned from his father, who is an elderly vendor in the city.  He has been in this business for over 30 years and is much in demand by his customers for the quality of his goods \r\n\r\nTo satisfy his burgeoning customer base, Drissa decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago.  He is on his second individual loan.  His preceding loan was repaid ahead of schedule.  With this loan, he intends to buy a ball of jerseys and one and a half balls of shoes.  The clothing is purchased locally from city wholesalers and is resold at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of women and men. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment his working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in his business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":322181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy second-hand clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Drissa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84721.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678841,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84721.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873541,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84721.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991011,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T19:30:16Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109595,"name":"Kate","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Divorced with two children who are working, Kate Boabeng is 51 years old.

She makes her purchases from wholesale merchants of the city and then resells them door-to-door in Sikasso.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":322194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy cloth, embroidered fabrics, and damask ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":26223.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020271,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":26223.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243027,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26223.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678845,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":26223.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112637,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26223.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028204,"comment":null},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":26223.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873542,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-01T10:19:28Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":109607,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia T. is 34 years old; she is married and the mother of two children.

The women all live in the Bamanan Kin district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali), and they know one another through ties of marriage and membership in the same traditional women's association in the area.  Thanks to the correct organizing of this traditional association, they've benefited through the NGO ROCAM from training in the dyeing of cloth, literacy, sanitation, and organizing micro-credit tontines banks with an interest rate of 10% a month.  This group does commerce in various goods, such as toys for children, cakes and cookies, soaps, firewood, juices for beverages, Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), etc.\r\n\r\nIn their search for supplemental financial resources, the women decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their fourth solidarity loan, after having repaid the preceding ones.  This new loan will be used to buy 28 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, 57 cart-loads of firewood, 2 sacks of sugar, a box of flavorings, 25 kg of dried hibiscus flowers, and 25 kg of tamarind.  \r\n\r\nThe group members resupply themselves with different goods at the grand marketplace of Bamako, from the fair vendors of Sansanding and Thien Bamanan, in Diamarabougou, and on the banks of the Niger River.

Sla\u0111ana wants to provide more income for her family in case her husband loses his job.

She lives in a nuclear family with her husband and children in the Darsalam district of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  She began in commerce in early childhood with her two parents, who were both merchants.  After several years of apprenticeship among her loved ones and having an improved command of the inner workings of commerce, she started to work in business on her own, earning an income by selling clothing, shoes, and kitchen utensils and by making juices for local soft drinks and ice cream. \r\n\r\nTo make her soft drinks, she uses 5 kg of sugar, 1 kg of ginger, 2 kg of tamarind, 20 bags of vanilla sugar, and 4 bags of juice powder (banana, mango, and orange).  It is all mixed in 1.5 liters of water in order to obtain the taste desired, and then it's put into carefully-washed drums.  These drums of non-alcoholic juice drink are put into the refrigerator to cool down for hours. \r\n\r\nConcerned about boosting her working capital, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso four years ago.  After four solidarity loans and two individual loans, correctly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan, which she intends to use to buy two sacks of sugar, two boxes of juice powder, and 20 sets of bed sheets.  Supplies of raw materials for the drinks are gotten in Bamako (capital of Mali); for the bed sheets, in Burkina Faso.\r\n\r\nMs. B. makes her sales to customers composed of women and men, cash or credit accepted.  With this loan, she plans to realize a monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan payments and to enhance little by little the house in which she lives. <br

She lives in a traditional family with her husband, children, and several families in the Darsalam district of the city of S\u00e9gou  (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Not having gone to school due to the refusal of her parents, who thought schooling is wasted on girls, she began working in small-scale commerce with her mother, who used to sell cotton clothing.  Upon marrying, Fatoumata switched to working in her husband's restaurant business. With some experience in this field, she finally opted 15 years ago for selling non-alcoholic juice drinks and ice cream. \r\n\r\nTo make her drinks, she uses 10 kg of sugar, 2 kg of ginger, 2 kg of tamarind, 30 bags of vanilla sugar, and 2 bags of juice powder (banana and orange).  It is all mixed together in three liters of water to obtain the desired taste.  Carefully-washed drums will be filled with the juice and put into the refrigerator to chill. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of bolstering and diversifying her business, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso.  She has been associated with this institution for 36 months.  After four solidarity loans and one individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.  She intends to use this loan to buy a new refrigerator, locally in S\u00e9gou. \r\n\r\nFatoumata makes her sales out of her home and at the grand marketplace of S\u00e9gou to customers composed of men and women, cash or credit accepted.
