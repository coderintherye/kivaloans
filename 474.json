They are now grown and live separately. Valentina is a successful entrepreneur from Kahovka, Kherson region in the south-east of Ukraine. She sells footwear in one of the local markets and she has been in this trade for 14 years. Economical crisis and high unemployment rates forced her to launch a small venture and to take the financial risks that come along with it. Valentina managed not only to survive in highly unfavorable surroundings but also to make her business sustainable. Currently, she has about 40,000 Grivnyas in stock. Her monthly net profit is little over 7,000 Grivnyas. \r\n\t\r\nValentina says she is happy to be able to provide for her family and realize they have everything they need for normal life. Moreover, she enjoys working with people on a daily basis, learning to serve her customers better and getting more experience along the way.

is part of the communal bank \u201cLuz de Esperanza\u201d (The Light for Hope), and lives in the city of Concepci\u00f3n.  Isabel is a cobbler, which involves sewing shoes with a special shoe machine. Isabel has spent the last 20 years perfecting this craft. At first, Isabel worked in a factory where she learned the craft, but for the past eight years Isabel has worked independently from Monday to Saturday in her house.\n \nIsabel uses a borrowed machine as her machine was lost during the earthquake of February 27, 2010, which also caused havoc to her home which was assessed by the government as uninhabitable.  Despite this, Isabel, her husband and two children (aged 18 and 16 years-old) still live in the house, occupying only a single room, as they have no other place to go.  The Chilean government has identified Isabel\u2019s families need for a house and through emergency fund programs will provide them a dwelling in approximately the next two years. \n\nIsabel dreams of owning a shoe repair shop. With this loan Isabel intends to purchase the shoe repair machine needed and return the one she has borrowed.  At this point Isabel\u2019s earnings are the only source of income for the family.  \n\nIsabel has enjoyed working with Fondo Esperanza, as the entrepreneurial training provided on business management is helpful.  Also, Isabel enjoys the companionship of her group, as meeting with them and her loan officer are her only distractions. \n\nConcepci\u00f3n is located at the mouth of the Biobio River, one of the country's largest rivers, in southern Chile's Biobio region. This is a historically important area, as it was the site of some important battles and settlements, especially during the War of Arauco, as it borders with Mapuche territory. The city is currently witnessing important economic and demographic development, and is considered to be one of the most important urban, administrative, financial and commercial nuclei of Chile, after Santiago and Valparaiso. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":614878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a sewing machine for shoes.

Her husband sells vegetables in the Portoviejo central market.\r\n<p> Mar\u00eda has a small restaurant in her home and says that she cooks very well and that is why two years ago she decided to have her own business making breakfast and lunches Monday through Friday from 5 a.m. until 2 p.m. but Saturdays and Sundays she works until 7 p.m. she also prepares diners. During the weekends her daughter helps her and she has many customers who prefer the food that she makes since it has better flavor.\r\n<p>This loan will be used to buy more products to make the food and to buy some pots since the ones that she has are too small and makes her work harder. This is her second loan with the communal bank and hopes to have more in the future.\r\n<p> Mar\u00eda\u2019s dream is to have a great restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":615018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy groceries and pots.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388843,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683045,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422169,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195840950,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283409,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-10T20:08:13Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237586,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

It is located in Mexico, in a place that is characterized by the ranch, La Purisima, which is the rest place for those that visit and a source of work for a few inhabitants of the community. The group is made up of 10 members.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is named Socorro Irene L.. She is 53 years old and studied up to the pre-college level. She tells us that her studies helped her get a job and thereby helped her parents pay their expenses. Up until the time when she got married, her job was a great help for her to get ahead, but after awhile she had to leave it. However, she refused to remain idle and decided to begin selling desserts, fried food, gelatin, and pork rinds to sustain her family and take care of her necessities. Socorro currently sells pork rinds and desserts. Generally, she sells the pork rinds outside a school near her house, and she sells desserts by request from her neighbors, people that she already knows, and sometimes by recommendation. Her dream is to have a location that allows her to have better sales and to be successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":615025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

At the time of this loan request, she is very enthusiastic about having a new machine that will give her better results with all she sews. \r\n\r\nMrs. Alicia Alc\u00e1ntara is another member of this group. She is 33 years old, studied up until high school, is from the middle class and has two children ages 8 and 4.  For the past for years she's been selling tamales. She used this loan to buy ingredients for her tamales, which are very appreciated among her clients. At the time of this loan request, she is very happy because this will enable her to add more flavorful choices to her tamales.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":614995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To invest in their clothing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tula, Hidalgo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-10-14T15:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Patricia Libertad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ailed Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Adriana Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gretchem Sacnicte Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":43000,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2207},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2264},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2322},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2381},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2443},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2505},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2570},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2636},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2703},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2773},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2844},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2917},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2992},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3069},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3147},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3227}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.59},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.52},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.71},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.29},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":226.53},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.31},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":628.77,"local_amount":7894,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7895.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177387592,"comment":null},{"amount":695.91,"local_amount":8737,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8738.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182525488,"comment":null},{"amount":1453.08,"local_amount":18243,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":18247.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660031,"comment":null},{"amount":647.24,"local_amount":8126,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":8127.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403300,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T19:34:06Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237594,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

They have six children who range in age from 14 to 28 years old. Two of their children have their own families, one is employed, two are looking for jobs and the youngest is currently going to school. The family lives in the barangay of Talavera, a part of Toledo City on Cebu island. Maria runs two businesses: a sari-sari (general) store and a ready-to-wear clothing shop. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, thus lifting the family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her sixth loan cycle, she is borrowing 16,000 PHP which she intends to use to buy more ready-to-wear clothes to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and help her youngest finish school. Maria L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They are on a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon\u2014a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her increase her monthly income to 10,400 PHP, thus lifting the family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her fourth loan cycle, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and her children's education. Pilargen R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Myrna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past sixteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myrna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5200, improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventeenth loan, she is borrowing PHP 17000, which she intends to use to buy more inventory to sell in her general store.  With the increased income, she will continue to save up for the future education of her child. Myrna J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Purok 1, Brgy. San Juan, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts working hard in her business. She is gradually making her family more economically stable; she now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7000. Margarita is now borrowing PHP 19500 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her business. This will be her fifteenth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Margarita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

 P. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Maasin, Brgy. Gargato, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a food vending business. Her husband Joel P., who is 28 years old, works as a driver, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is five years old. Ronavic joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to achieve something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ronavic has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 4000 increased her monthly income to PHP 6000, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to stock her general store so that she may continue to save up for her child's education. Ronavic P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

S. is a 45-year old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures, an eatery and an oyster vending business. She lives in Purok Su-ol, Brgy. Nanunga, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her Eatery and oyster vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12000. Gleceria is borrowing PHP 19000 so that she may fund operations of her eatery and oyster vending businesses. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Gleceria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is a single woman who lives in  Brgy. Lipayo, Dauin, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a general store and a house rental business. Adela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to achieve something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to restock her general store so that she may continue to save up for the future expansion of her businesses. Adela A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of 18,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock to sell in her general store so that she can continue to sustain her daily needs, pay for her maintenance medication and save up for her future security. \r\n\r\nJulieta A. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Josefina has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.

This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

Gomez is a native of Sabanalarga, a place where they say \"intelligence is endemic.\"  He has a fruit stand where he also offers calling services and sells lottery tickets.  It is located in a public place very close to a bus terminal, and the business is going very well because there are constantly people who are traveling and inter-departmental (long-distance) buses that are arriving.  Their passengers buy the delicious fruit to start their trip with and make calls through an operator, and they also buy lottery tickets, dreaming that some day they will become millionaires or have a few more pesos that they can enjoy.\r\n\r\nHis life has changed a lot, and he says that it changed 360 degrees since he became involved with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and got his first loan, which he was not able to do with any other institution.  This Kiva loan is his 5th loan; he wants to buy fruit at wholesale which he will turn around and distribute to other traders, and he also wants to make some improvements to his kitchen.\r\n\r\nGumercindo is a hardworking man and an exemplary father.  He began in the business that his father taught him; he was selling lottery tickets from the time he was 17 years old.  For some time this was his main activity and source of income.  Sometime later he worked selling newspapers.  He had assistants who did not bring back the money that he had to pay the company, which he had to deposit daily.  But this did not cause him to lose his enthusiasm to continue working and dedicate himself to his business.  Through the business he managed to educate his children and today some of them are working in companies in the city and others work in commercial activities with the advice of their father.  As he has been a good saver, he bought a lot with his earnings and built his house in the Carrizal neighborhood, thanks to his sacrifice and his will to get ahead with his family.  For this reason, he now feels content and will continue to work to further improve his income and his standard of living.\r\n

Merlita has been engaged in her business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merlita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Merlita is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Merlita from ASKI.

F\u00e9lix feels very grateful to God because He has given him the wisdom needed to administer his businesses well and with this he has been able to cover the family expenses and school fees for his two oldest children.  One of the difficulties of his business is that there are times when there is little work to do, but the advantage is that he also has the grocery store and this helps him to support his family.  The problems he is facing right now are the deterioration of his work tools and that his 15-year-old son had and accident and this is incurring medical bills.  He is requesting the loan to expand a part of his workshop and for this he needs to buy construction materials like cement, rebar, blocks, sand, etc. With this he will be able to improve the appearance of his business and attract more customers.  His dream is that his business will grow each day so that he can give his family a better quality of life.

By the grace of God, Teresita has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store where her main products are mostly school supplies. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a few pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rates.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries, beverages, and school supplies to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business.

This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from MUK.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNi Wayan Suwitri 0 (0) merupakan 40 tahun wanita.

Besides this business, she also has a container which she rents out to other people to use as a shop. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she faces is competition from many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers. She says that there are other people in Kitengela who are well established and own big hardware stores and even provide transport facilities. However, she works very hard to keep her business going well. She is using her loan of KES 30,000 to buy more bags of cement to expand her business.

B. is 51 years old and lives with his wife and two children in their own ger, a traditional housing tent, in Uvs province, Mongolia.  Both his children are students, currently working and studying in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His wife operates a clothes making business in their home, by sewing a variety of traditional clothes according to customers' orders. Choijid has been operating a car repair center for the past 7 years and has since built a stable operation. His monthly revenue is around 150,000 MNT. He has purchased 8,000 bricks and is planning to build a garage that will be used as a workplace.

Rosalina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosalina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosalina is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Rosalina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives with her husband and their children in Mancourani 1, one of the working-class districts of the town of Sikasso (the Republic of Mali's third administrative region).\r\n\r\nHaving had many unsuccessful businesses, Mamina has been carrying out this business, buying and selling clothing (coloured damask fabric, \"pagnes wax\" - which are typical West African highly decorative and colourful pieces of fabric - shoes, embroidered material etc.) for more than ten years. She buys her supplies in Conakry (in the Republic of Guinea) before reselling them on a door-to-door basis, to a customer base made up essentially of housewives. She also has a fridge and uses this to sell ice-cream and fruit juice. She is in great demand from her customers for the quality of her products.  \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy ever increasing customer demand, she decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, more than six years ago. Having had several group loans as part of a women's association in her neighborhood, of which she was president, she is now on her first individual loan. All the previous (group) loans were repaid in full. This first individual loan will allow her to buy four coloured damask fabric outfits, five pieces of \"pagnes wax\", two outfits in embroidered material and five pairs of different shoes.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 90,000FCFA, which will be used essentially to increase her business, contribute to family expenses and pay the interest on her loan.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":616351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy coloured damask fabric, \"pagnes wax\", shoes and embroidered material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-11T11:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":42232.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476892,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":42232.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613604,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":42232.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752035,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42232.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606283,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":42232.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917945,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-11T13:51:50Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237879,"name":"Erdenejargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erdenejargal C. is 30 years old and lives with her husband and 4-year-old son in her own \"ger,\" a traditional Mongolian nomadic home tent, in the Songinohairhan district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

P. is from the village of Pinamulaan, Banisilan, South Cotabato. She is 38 years old, married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Florentina owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food and daily use products in the local community. Florentina has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Florentina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Florentina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. This will be the second loan that Florentina has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives with her husband, his two other wives and their children in Hamdallaye, one of the working-class districts of the town of Sikasso (the Republic of Mali's third administrative region).\r\n\r\nHaving had many unsucessful activities, notably village farming, she began her business buying and selling calabashes (fruit grown on a vine which can be dried and used as bottles or utensils) and other items more than ten years ago. \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy her ever increasing customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso's loan program about five years ago. After six group loans, as part of an association of women from her neighborhood (Hamdallaye's Benkadi Association) she is currently on her third individual loan. All her previous loans have been repaid in full. She is thus requesting a third loan to buy ten parcels of calabashes in the Tona area of S\u00e9gou (Mali's fourth administrative region) before reselling them on a retail basis at the large market in S\u00e9gou near to the town hall at the centre of the town, to a customer base made up mainly of women and above all miners. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of 170,000FCFA, which will be used primarily to expand her business, contribute to family expenses and pay interest on his loan;

Teo, aged 47, says she has mostly naively glossed over the things she does unwittingly that have led to groundbreaking improvements in her retail shop business in Kyaliwajjala-Mukono over the past 25 years. Having achieved that longevity, she says complacency may be playing a part. She, for example, has not often taken into account the fact that being cordial to clients is a 'stars and stripes' magic formula to lure more prospective or actual clients. \r\n\r\nThis happily married mother of four exhilarating children says her good natured way of operating her business has got her more than she bargained for.

M. is from the village of Tumbao, Banisilan, Cotabato. She is 52 years old,  married, and has nine adult children. To make a living, Teresita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Teresita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":616423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. Asadu has been in his commercial motorcycle business in Bwaise-Kampala for one and a half years now. By and large, his circumstances have been a mixture of good and bad. Bad given the increasing competition that directly translates to frustration, especially on days when clients are few. Good on the basis that at least he is able to make ends meet. Often he has had to begin with a new slate after some disappointing days at work. \r\n\r\nUpbeat tenacity, courage and perseverance stand out as his winning attributes. 50,000 shillings as weekly profits is quite modest but he remains optimistic that with this loan he can make a lot of headway in his trade. At his young age Asadu is already married with four high-spirited kids. \r\n\r\n Asadu looks back with nostalgia at the time when he was a builder.  It is with money saved from building houses that he was able to purchase his motorcycle. With this Kiva loan, he says he is going to buy another motorcycle that he says will go a long way toward enabling him to earn more profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":548.98,"image":{"id":614676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"The purchase of another motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-10-12T14:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.02,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asadu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.92,"local_amount":242000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":249562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605863,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":154687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744918,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":123750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191483044,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":123750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195909727,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":123750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352235,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":123750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211293878,"comment":null},{"amount":116.88,"local_amount":255000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":262968.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216573870,"comment":null},{"amount":32.43,"local_amount":73000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":75281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.02,"payment_id":222022250,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T11:14:31Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T08:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237930,"name":"Thekrayat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thekrayat is a young woman from Jenin city.

is married with two children. Their family lives in Isfara, Tajikistan. Abbos owns a small enterprise selling dried fruits like dried apricot, raisins, pistachios etc. in the local market. His business is well known in the marketplace for reasonable and affordable prices and so attracts many customers. Abbos has been in the trade for 10 years and has learned a lot about making his business a profitable one. <p>\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of $1000 USD to increase his turnover capital. With this, he intends to generate additional income to be set aside for the education of his children, who will soon need to start thinking about college. As Abbos is an experienced businessman and a responsible father, we believe the current loan will benefit his small venture and assist his family. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a widow with one daughter in her care: Sonia Saraos H., age 19, and a grandson who has lived with her since he was little, Alde\u00edn, age 9. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy merchandise and stock her clothing business with items such as pants, shirts, t-shirts, children's suits, blouses, and dresses, among others. She sells these items in the communities near her village. She has done this work for nin years, and it is going well for her, since she has been able to obtain a good income for her household. \r\n\r\nWhat motivated her to start this activity was her family, since she is a woman alone and had to find a way to obtain an income and help her family get ahead. \r\n\r\nWith the earnings she obtains from her business, she will buy more merchandise of better quality, so that her customers will be motivated to buy more. With this, she will be able to earn better profits and expand her business. \r\n\r\nThe dream that Fe de Luz has is to be able to save up enough to build a store where she can display her merchandise, so the people from nearby settlements can buy her clothing while she goes out to sell her merchandise in other communities. Thus, she would obtain income from both sides of her business. However, the most important thing for her is that her daughter continues her studies and finishes her degree so she can become a doctor. \r\n\r\nShe formed the group with two other women who have already worked with a loan, and they comment that it is going well for them. The group is called \"El Crucero\" [The Crossing], and the reason for the name is that one of the members has cross the highway which divides the area from other towns, so they decided to choose this name. \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of three women, each with a different activity: \r\n\r\nOfelia G\u00f3mez Jim\u00e9nez will invest the loan in buying Tupperware plastic items, such as plastic boxes, pitchers and cups, among others. \r\nFe de Luz H.

They were provided with water from wells from the surrounding areas, but the quantity of water needed and the distance it had to go was too much for the wells. \n\nThe proposal to form the commission was the idea of Sivlerio R., who is a local and one of those affected by the lack of water. He organized a meeting where he proposed that everyone get together and carry out some kind of activity to raise funds so that they could afford the construction of a good artesian well. Later, professionals from the Municipality advised them, and they received a donation from the local government of a water pump, plumbing, faucets, etc. to have good distribution of water among the families. \n\nThis idea gave them great enthusiasm. News spread, and right away more families joined. They organized soccer tournaments, barbeque chicken sales, raffles, bingo, and playing card tournaments all to raise the necessary funds as quickly as possible. Thanks to their dedication, determination, and hard work, they raised enough money to pay for the construction. Everything was a success, due to the enthusiasm of the inhabitants and their desire to work together throughout all the events to achieve their goal.\n\nRight now, they have an artesian well, a 30,000 liter tank at a good height, pipes connecting to all the families, and good and abundant pressure of potable water, benefitting a total of 180 families. \n\nThe Saguazu Sanitation Committee continues to be active with the upkeep of the potable water system, including maintenance, cleaning, paying for the electricity consumption, and finding solutions to ordinary problems in the whole water distribution system. \n\nThey are interested in purchasing a spare motor. During the summer the motor is used much more. This way, when they need to conduct maintenance, they can use the backup. \n\nAbout Water Installation Loans\n\nFundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya recently launched this exciting new loan product with the help of Kiva. Ikatu Agua loans are designed to provide communities without access to drinking water the money they need to dig wells, set pipeline networks and install water meters. The loan is given to a group of community leaders, who form a Sanitation Board in representation of their entire community. Members of the Sanitation Board are responsible for contracting builders, overseeing construction and collecting small, regular contributions from all community members. These contributions are pooled and returned to Kiva lenders in the form of loan

They decided on this name because all of the members are of the Catholic faith and they are very devoted to the Virgen Mary. The story told here is about Victorina D. R., one of the members of the group. She is 39 years old; she is  married with Juan Carlos and they have 4 children together: Abel, 19 years old, Joaquin, 16  years old and in high school, Paola, 13 years old and in grade 8, and Jesus, 10 years old and in  grade 5. She sells snacks for a living. \r\n\r\nShe started out the business because she wanted to find a way to better contribute with her husband towards the household expenses and their kids' education.  In the village where she lives there are no businesses that sell foods in the afternoons and besides that, she loves to cook. The loan that she requests will be used to purchase ingredients and merchandise such as:  cooking oil, salt, tomatoes, napkins, plates, spoons, tortillas, meats, and chili peppers. She will be able to keep cooking her delicious foods.\r\n\r\nThe profits that she earns from her business have been a great advantage to her because she is able to support her children and significantly improve the quality of their life. She is able to support her husband fully with the household expenses, and with their kids' tuition. \r\n\r\nBut the business is also a benefit to the members of her community because it is the only food that is sold, so when people don't have the time or the energy to prepare their own meals they come to buy from her. \r\n\r\nVictorina has set a goal for herself to provide her children with a quality education so that they will train for a career and have a good profession and a better future. She also wants to see her business grow much more and eventually have a restaurant where she set herself up indefinitely and obtain better profits.\r\n\r\nShe says that the other members of the group are very responsible individuals, always complying with their commitments and they all enjoy their work. They like to improve themselves and overcome any difficulties. They have all known each other for some time and they are all financially responsible individuals, not being people that defraud others from the trust that was imparted upon them. \r\n\r\nVictorina is grateful on her behalf and on that of her FRAC (Kiva Field Partner) family and to Kiva. It was with their help that she was able to change her life and that of her children. They will benefit from a better quality of life and a better education. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group and their businesses are the following: \r\n\r\nBaltasar Antonio S.: grocery store\r\nArtemia Florentina Lo\u00f3pe: chicken sales\r\nMayra Crisitina A.

The group is located in the Municipality of Ribera Guadalupe in Coapilla, in the state of Chiapas in Mexico. The name of the group was chosen because it is the first time that any of the members have ever requested a loan from Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner). They are very happy for the support. \r\n\r\nThe name of the individual interviewed is Mr. Bernal P. S.. He lives together with his partner, Evangelina Jimenez Vasquez. Together they have six children together. Two of their kids are already married but four still remain in their care: Jesus is 23 years old, Daniel is 22 years old, Israel is 20, and Sandra is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nHe was inspired as a very young man to start up his own business. He learned the trade from his father-in-law who is a carpenter. He started out working with him but later he wanted to set up his own carpentry shop. He has 25 years in the business now and with its help he has been able to support his family.\r\n\r\nWith the profits he earns from his carpentry business he has been able to support their children in their studies. He has always saved money for whenever they have an expense, always wanting to provide them with the best and help them achieve their goals. He also purchases materials for his business. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to see his four youngest children complete their studies and grow up to be well established individuals and be able to support themselves. He also dreams of buying a car to transport the furniture he makes to the communities where the orders originate and to stop having to pay transportation expenses. \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of three individuals: \r\n\r\nMaria Dulia P. E.: she will invest her loan in the purchase of ingredients to make tamales: chili peppers, banana leaves, meats, etc. \r\n\r\nGerardo P. S.: he will invest his loan in the purchase of mazeca flour to resell in his community. \r\n\r\nBernal P. S.: he will invest in the purchase of wood to make furniture such as closets, chairs, windows, and dining room sets. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":613231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To purchase wood for carpentry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T15:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Garardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1871.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1947.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2045.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2134.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":152.1,"local_amount":1871.99,"processed_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415407,"comment":null},{"amount":158.25,"local_amount":1947.69,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1962.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554983,"comment":null},{"amount":166.19,"local_amount":2045.37,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691473,"comment":null},{"amount":173.46,"local_amount":2134.95,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2151.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430657,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T17:30:43Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238035,"name":"Amour Divin Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronald L. is the coordinator of his group Amour Divin or \u201cDivine Love\u201d.
