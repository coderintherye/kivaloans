S. is from the village of Pigsag-an, Cagayan De Oro City. She is 25 years old. Melenda is married and has 1 infant-aged child. To make a living, Melenda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The primary--but not only--source of income for this business comes from selling a variety of different products to the local community. Melenda has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos (or about $250 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Melenda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Melenda is requesting a loan of 5000 pesos (or about $125) which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Melenda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Rahima lives in Dushanbe, Tajikistan with two children. She has been selling women's clothing in one of the local markets for 5 years. Due to her highly motivated entrepreneurial spirit and meticulous survey of the market, Rahima has found her niche and customer base. Her unique ability to market her inventory and meet her customers' needs is contributing to the rapid growth of her business. However Rahima believes her venture has only started to grow and there is still great potential for further expansion. She would love to open more vending facilities. Her strategy is to increase her stock and generate additional profits which will then be reinvested in her trade. That is why Rahima is asking for a loan of $500 US to purchase new inventory and help develop and upgrade her small business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

N. is a 45-year-old widow who lives with her three sons and one daughter in Arhangai province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. His children's ages range from 19 to 26. Oyunchimeg is a very entrepreneurial woman. Since 1992, she has been involved in many types of small business. Her first business was importing cheap clothes from Ereen, China, a border town from where many cheap Chinese products are imported. Since 2004, she has been selling cut wood to local carpenters. Within five years, she expanded the business, with her business capital increasing from 1,000,000 MNT to 3,400,000 MNT. \r\n<p>\r\nNow Oyunchimeg would like to open a small internet cafe to offer internet services and computer games to local people. She sees a great market opportunity as many local young people are really getting into internet surfing and computer games. She is committed to making the internet cafe a success as her private businesses are the sole source of family income. All of her children are top students at their respective high schools, and Oyunchimeg wants to make sure that they all continue their studies at the universities of their choice and pursue their dreams. She says that she works very hard to make all this come true. \r\n<p>\r\nOyunchimeg is requesting a loan to purchase computers and internet access for her new internet

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He has managed to send all his children to school. He has been a carpenter for four years now, and carpentry is his main source of livelihood. Andrew is very hardworking and dedicated to his work. He owns a carpentry shop where he manufactures all kinds of furniture, such as chairs, wardrobes, beds etc. However, because he lacks adequate working capital, he is not able to pre-finance most of his customer orders. This slows his work down because he has to wait for funds from his customers before any work can begin, often resulting in delays.

When she joined CCT in 2005, she was able to keep her store going and growing. The store, located at the heart of the Habitat and near the school, caters to customers from all over. Sittinona took advantage of its location near the school by adding school supplies to satisfy the high demand from elementary students at a nearby school.

They use their combined income from the store and the jeepney's daily income to support the education of their three children. Sittinona dreams of acquiring another vehicle to transport her inventory from the market.\n\nAbout CCT\nCCT is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started with a meager capital of Php 7,000 when she opened her business four years ago. She now earns approximately Php 5,000 a day.

She has applied for a Php 12,000 loan from CCT. She will use the loan proceeds to purchase additional grocery items to sell in her bakery\/grocery store and raw materials like flour, sugar, and lard used in bread production. She dreams of owning a delivery van so she can also sell her bread and pastries in nearby towns.\n\nAbout CCT\nCCT is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

The demand for transportation in their community picked up with the establishment of Habitat for Humanity Community Housing. In the same year she purchased her first motorized tricycle and then had to purchase a second one.  She joined the CCT Credit Cooperative in 2004, at that time she was only managing two pedicabs (a manually operated tricycle with no engine).  She disposed off these manual tricycles in 2005.\r\n\r\nJust recently, she bought her third motorcycle.  Her son is now test-driving this with a sidecar is mounted to it.  She has just finished paying off her CCT loan of Php 10,000.00 which she used to pay for the down payment for her third motorcycle.  She took a new loan in the amount of Php 12,000.00 to purchase and refurbish a second-hand side-car to be mounted on her newly purchased motorcycle.\r\n\r\nNoraida is very proud of having been part of the CCT Credit Cooperative.  She is even delighted to see her neighbors taking rounds in driving her motorized tricycles for a living.  She dreams of owning a taxicab someday. \r\n\r\nCCT is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered on the Lordship of Jesus

They named their group Frozen Fish Mongers, picking a name that reflects their trade. They are all local entrepreneurs in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. This is not their first loan from Kiva through SMT. They all previously received several loans from Kiva through SMT. Each member of the group received a loan of Le 1,200,000 during the last loan cycle. That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees.  They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans.  Today, they are requesting a loan of Le 1,300,000 each to buy more cartons of frozen fish to add to their businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nKadiatu (back row, right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-five years of age. She was born in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a businessman and the couple has four children. Two of her children are in college and two are in secondary schools. Kadiatu has been a businesswoman for over twenty years now.\r\n<p> \r\nKadiatu, like the rest of the group members, sells frozen fish. With this new loan, she will expand her business. She will be able to buy about ten cartons of frozen fish. She usually travels to Freetown to buy the fish. The fare to Freetown is Le 12,000 and she usually pays a delivery fee of Le 1,000 per carton. In Freetown, the price for a carton of fish ranges between Le 65,000 to Le 95,000 depending on the type and quality.\r\n<p>\r\nSo far, Kadiatu faces no serious challenge in her business that are worth noting. Business is going fine and well. She enjoys what she does for a living. To Kadiatu and her colleagues in the group, an increase in profit means making their lives better. They will be able to take good care of their children, specifically their educational and nutritional needs, and save some money for emergencies.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":354313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy additional frozen fish to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T12:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":6500000,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":395,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1301526.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87103083,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97020094,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864939,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754744,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118143761,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123981187,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129012256,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136736627,"comment":null},{"amount":197.5,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":650763.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144770048,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-19T19:07:02Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:59:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":123244,"name":"Nanoor Godaguene Ii Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nNanoor Godaguene II  est un groupe de femmes habitant pr\u00e9s du village sandiara localit\u00e9 situ\u00e9e \u00e0 25 km de la ville Mbour .Elles s\u2019activent dans l\u2019agriculture,  le petit commerce et l\u2019embouche.

You can help improve the quality of life of Halimajon\u2019s family. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and is a father of 6 children.  His wife is not employed.  She stays at home, does domestic work and feeds livestock.  Ubaidullo is involved in feeding and selling livestock.  Summer time for Ubaidullo is the season for purchasing livestock because livestock and animal feed prices are cheaper during the summer.  And he does not need to spend very much on feeding livestock.  Livestock eats mountain grass, allowing Ubaidullo to save on livestock feed.  At the onset of winter, Ubaidullo sells some of the fed livestock, but he does not buy new livestock.  He buys animal feed for the remaining livestock.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":354818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Livestock feeding and sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ubaidullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":123260,"name":"Asana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asana is a 54-year-old woman.

Mar\u00eda tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene cinco hijos de 9, 7, 5, 3 a\u00f1os y la \u00faltima de un mes de edad, los tres primeros hijos los cuales son varones est\u00e1n estudiando en la escuela de Ceraturo. Antes de ser socia de la Fundaci\u00f3n trabajaba conjuntamente con su esposo en una hacienda la  Victoria del Portete  como peones, sacando leche de las vacas, en labores del campo, su horario era de 6 AM. A 6 PM. En esta hacienda los jefes eran algunos buenos y otros malos, pero lo que no le gustaba a Mar\u00eda era que no los consideraban ya que deb\u00edan ser cumplidos con su trabajo que no hab\u00eda ning\u00fan justificativo para faltar, no les importaba hijos ni enfermedades. Es socia m\u00e1s o menos desde el 16 de Junio de este a\u00f1o, un vecino del barrio les hizo conocer de la fundaci\u00f3n y les invit\u00f3 a que ingresen, pidi\u00f3 $110 de pr\u00e9stamo para comprar cuyes y hierba, para de esta manera salir de la hacienda en donde ella trabaja porque el tiempo no le alcanza para cuidar a sus hijos.

Ella tambi\u00e9n se encarga de los quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos de su propia casa. Suele trabajar desde las 7:30am hasta las 5pm. Est\u00e1 pidiendo este cr\u00e9dito de $220 para comprar productos de Avon, porque vende a cr\u00e9dito. Aveces la empresa hace promociones, entonces para ella le conviene cubrir los costos en estos momentos y recuperarlos despu\u00e9s. Ella toma pedidos de sus clientes para cada quincena, y suele recibir $100-$120 en pedidos cada quincena, de los cuales un 25% es ganancia para ella (la ganancia se desminuye entre 5% y 10% despu\u00e9s de tomar en cuenta sus costos). Este es la primera vez que ella ha sacado un pr\u00e9stamo.

This region experiences extreme cold while fog develops in the afternoons, making it difficult for people to travel through the streets and preventing them from leaving their homes.\r\n<p>\r\nMember Mar\u00eda Tr\u00e1nsito P., for the past 3 months, has been living in the house of her sister-in-law who currently resides abroad.   Mar\u00eda is 23 years old, married, and has 5 children (ages 9, 7, 5, 3 and 1 month).  Three of the children attend school in Ceraturo.  Before joining Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she and her husband worked on the Victoria del Portete Estate as farm laborers.  They milked the cows and worked in the fields.  Their work schedule was from 6am to 6pm.  At the estate, some of the supervisors were good and while others were bad.  However, none of them liked it whenever Mar\u00eda had to miss work or leave early to take care of her children whenever they became sick.  She became a member around June 16th of this year when a neighbor told her about the Foundation and invited her to join.  She is requesting a loan of $110 so that she can buy guinea pigs and grass, enabling her to quit her farm job so that she can spend more time caring for her children.  Her goal is to start breeding more animals, not just guinea pigs, but also cows, pigs and chickens so that her family can get ahead and become self-sufficient.\r\n<p>\r\nMember Rosal\u00eda C. is 36 years old, married and has a 16 year old daughter.  Her husband works in an auto body shop, repairing and painting cars.  Meanwhile, she works as a domestic helper and also sells Avon cosmetic products and other brands as well.  Her clients are primarily neighbors, friends and acquaintances.  She has been selling cosmetics for 8 years.  When she was younger she previously worked as a temporary employee, a salaried employee, and also in restaurants.  She also takes charge of the domestic duties for her own home. Rosal\u00eda works from 7:30am to 5pm.  She is requesting a loan of $220 to buy Avon products because she sells on credit.  Sometimes the company has promotions, so she can pay for the products now and recoup the costs afterwards when customers make their payments.  She takes orders from her customers every two weeks, which totals between $100-$120, of which 25% is profit.  (That figure is reduced between 5-10% after taking into account the costs of the products.)  This is the first time she has taken out a loan.  In the future she would like to open her own business, such as restaurant, because she enjoys cooking.\r\n<p>\r\nAll members have promised to pay their loans on time and in a responsible manner.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

R. is 46, is a single mom and has five kids, whom she lives with in the same house, for a few years she has worked in selling dairy (cheese, cream and milk curd), products that she travels to purchase to Chontales, where she buys them at a lower price.\r\n\r\nWith this business, Mrs. E. has been able to provide for her children's studies and cover her home expenses, because of her academic level (she can't read nor write) it is difficult for her to have a job that makes enough for her expenses.  This is the second loan with Kiva and the previous one was paid back on time and in full.  She indicates being content with the people that have helped her finance her loan, which allowed her to purchase more product and make more profit.\r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan to purchase the following dairy products: 300 pounds of cheese at $1 US\/pound, 300 pounds of cream at $0.60 US each and 100 creamy milk curds at $0.70 US per pound.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Las  ventas las realiza durante la ma\u00f1ana y por la tarde se abastece nuevamente de mercader\u00eda. Para un futuro cercano, Vilma quiere mejorar su puesto de venta con nuevos cuchillos, una balanza nueva y una vitrina de exhibici\u00f3n. Esta es la primera vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, por lo que se compromete a ser  responsable en la devoluci\u00f3n de su cr\u00e9dito. El dinero que viene solicitando ser\u00e1 destinado a la compra de mayor cantidad de carne.","en":"Vilma is a 41-year-old woman who lives with her husband and children in their own home.

L\u00f3pez, and Patricia Edith Gait\u00e1n L\u00f3pez.\r\n\r\nThis is the solidarity group B., from the city of Masaya, who are known for their hard work.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Maribel del Socorro P. is the group coordinator. The members chose her for this term. She sells vegetables in the market during the morning and works as a seamstress in the afternoon, making clothing in her home. She does this work with her mother as a secondary source of income. She has two adolescent children who are in a local school. They also help with sales in the commmunity and make deliveries to some clients. She is unmarried and has worked in order to support her children.\r\nShe will use the loan to buy vegetables and offer her clients a variety of celery, lettuces, tomatoes, bananas, etc.\r\n\r\nDon Ascensi\u00f3n B. has been a member of this group since it began. He lives near the other two members and sells food, soft drinks, candy, and other products. He is unmarried and has no children, but he helps support four young nephews, whom he's put through school. They are 12, 15, 16, and 17 years old, and they help him with his business. He dreams of continuing to support them and pay for their schooling so they can obtain university degrees.\r\n\r\nPatricia Edith Gait\u00e1n is the last member of this group. She makes clothing at home and also sells candy, soft drinks, etc. She has three children, 12, 10, and 7 years old. She is unmarried and doesn't receive financial support from anyone else.\r\nShe needs the loan to buy materials like fabrics, thread, notions, and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe members make payments on Mondays. It's the best day to make payments because sales are better on the weekends.\r\n\r\nThey work with Adim because of her clients encouraged her to join a solidarity group, so she formed a group with two close friends and obtained a loan. They are happy because they feel that the institution trusts them, and they say they intend to be prompt with their payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea

The sale of gas has helped Juana\u2019s progress a great deal, and she has seen how her situation has improved over time.  Her store is on a major street in the city of Juliaca, and she is one of the most well known fuel distributors in her area.  Her charisma and good humor have turned her into an excellent saleswoman.  What she most enjoys about her work is that it allows her to still have time to tend to her family and home.  She has been in this business for a year, and finds the most difficult aspect to be making sure her gas cylinders are in perfect condition so she doesn\u2019t run any unnecessary risks.  She hopes that her business will continue to grow, and that she can turn it into a larger enterprise.

The thing she likes best about her work are those times of boredom when she can enjoy watching one of the movies she has. Vicky has been doing this business for 15 years, and the thing she thinks is most difficult is having to endure the intense cold in the area, which is more than 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) above sea level, but she knows that she has to put 100% of herself into the business in order to succeed.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, Vicky hopes to have a store where she can better attend to her customers.

Hern\u00e1ndez y Ana Mar\u00eda R. M\u00e9ndez.\r\n\r\nThe members of the united group, El Buen Pastor, are from the city of Masaya in the La Reforma region.  They have worked with Admin for several loan cycles because they feel that is an institution that has believed in them.  They feel like part of the Admin family.  All of the members of the group have sold clothes as street vendors for many years.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Felix has been the group\u2019s coordinator for years.  She has known the turns her business takes.  She has seen how each loan has led to having a bigger inventory.  She is a mother who raised her children by herself.  She taught them how to work.  For many years she has been selling fruits and vegetables.  She buys them in the Masaya market, and she sells them for a better price in the Oriental market.  Everything that she has achieved motivates her to keep working and doing well with Admin.  She lets her group know this.  She is in charge of going and leaving the installment to be sure of its punctuality.\r\n\r\nSabina de los Angeles P. sells tamales and corn, etc.  She makes them in her house.  Very early the following day she sells them in the Oriental market.  She has done this for over ten years.  She has one young son who works.  Her son and her husband help her with the household expenses.  She dreams of improving a part of her house that needs it.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda R. is a very hard working woman who sells clothes.  She has one son who lives with her.  With the income from her work, she raised him without help from anyone.  It is clear to her that a loan is based on trust, and she must be punctual with her payment.  She sells clothes and cosmetics; this helps her receive more income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

The women have their own businesses and depend only on themselves. They are well known for their work in their neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nMarisol has a small women's sandal-making shop, which she runs with three workers, her father and her children. She is the mother of four children who are seven, nine, 10, and 13 years old, all of whom study and help her at the shop. Her husband helps her with household expenses; he works for the radio. She said that the business is her own, and she buys what she wants for herself and her children. She dreams of improving her business, thus improving her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nLydia Isabel is an older woman with a family of three teens who attend the neighborhood school. They help her with her chicken-selling business, but her strongest business is selling clothes on credit. She sells pants, shirts, shoes, etc. Her husband works in a parts shop and helps her with household expenses. Through her business, Lydia Isabel takes on extra household expenses such as clothes for the kids, school notebooks, etc. Her business guarantees income for the home, and because of this, she plays an important role in making household decisions. Lydia is the leader of this group; she was elected because she is very responsible.\r\n\r\nElsa del Carmen Jarqu\u00edn, aside from being the final group member, owns a small women's sandal-making shop. She has one permanent employee, and the rest of the business is run with the help of her children and husband. She also makes and sells baked goods out of her home.

They live humble lives and work with Adim because they like that they trust them. They are neighbors that trust each other since they have known each other for many years and are very united.\r\n\r\nMrs. Teodora del Socorro Jarqu\u00edn is the coordinator of the group. She was elected because she is a very responsible person. She is a widow, and she has a small grocery store that is well-stocked with products. She has a 15-year-old daughter, who is in school. She dreams of improving her business and someday of having a general store so that her daughter can study and have a job.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lesbia Johana is a young woman, who sells chicha (a type of beverage) in bags and in bottles. She distributes this to vendors, who offer her drinks in the neighborhoods and in the market. At present, she has two vendors. In her house, she also sells them individually. She has pursued this activity for more than 4 years, and she has taken her family forward. Her husband helps her with the expenses for their three children. He is a teacher. She also sells clothes on credit as a second job. She dreams of providing for her children to attend university. Her children as 16, 15, and 14 years old. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mar\u00eda Teresa S\u00e1nchez is a young woman. She has an eight-year-old daughter, who attends a school near her house.

She has one son, who is an adult. Her husband works as a security guard in a business in Managua. She began her business 5 years ago. At first, she was working in a salon in the market. The loan is needed to buy materials like liquids for perms, shampoo, cosmetics, etc. She dreams of having a more complete salon, to improve her house, and to separate her salon from her house.\r\n\r\nThis group has promised to make their payments punctually, and this is how they continue to get loan from Adim. She are certain that with this loan they will go forward because they will be able to increase their sales and, therefore, their incomes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah,

She is 23 years old, married and has 3 school-aged children. Sarrah Mae owns and operates a specialized retail store where she sells native wine made of coconut juice commonly known as \"tuba\" in the local community. Everyday Sarrah Mae and her husband patiently go around the community to sell \"tuba\" which she has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2006, Sarrah Mae joined PMPC to improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sarrah Mae successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. \n\nSarrah Mae is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which she will use to pay for a short-term lease on coconut land in order to have additional trees to cultivate. From there, she hopes to produce more \"tuba\" to sell. This loan will be her 6th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve her family's general living conditions.\n\nSarrah Mae is shown in the picture with her plastic jugs of \"tuba\" she personally delivers -- by riding on the back of a motorcycle -- to her customers.\n\nAbout PMPC\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\nNote\n\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She hopes to give their children the best education to give them a better life someday. \r\n\r\nDespite the hardship of life, they still have the strong determination to support the education of their children and to save for their future. Her husband manages their watch-repair shop in the Public Market while Flor sells different products like vegetables and some cooked snacks. Due to lack of business capital, she came to propose a loan of PHP 10,000 for the maintenance of their watch business in their place.

smiling face in the accompanying photograph is Mrs. Chhun Y., who is 51 years old.

She is 45 years old. Elba is married and has eight school-aged children. To make a living, Elba does traditional gold mining. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling gold per gram. Elba has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elba joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elba has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. Elba is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for \"pamiling\". This loan will be the third loan taken out by Elba from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and farm financing. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. R. is from the village of Mansabay Bajo, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. She is 28 years old. Marites is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Marites owns & operates a business selling fish to local community members. Marites has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. Marites is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to buy a fishing net. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Marites from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga D. Sur, Lanao D. Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is from the village of Tumapagon, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 33 years old. Gina is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Gina owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling viands, binignit (a local delicacy) and barbecue (grilled meat) in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business and some funds were used for their daily needs. Gina is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering and engage in the buying and selling of gold dust in their local community. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Gina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Parveen baji is applying for a loan to buy timber to grow her husband\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nThis loan consists of two additional people: Elizabeth baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle) and Irshad baji wants a loan to buy goats for her butcher shop. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible. \r\n\r\nNote: Parveen baji is seated in the middle of the bajis.

Kav C., however, is lacking equipment to fish and that is why he requested a loan to purchase nets, traps, and other tools for his fishing operations.\r\n\r\nThere are three other borrowers who have requested a loan as follows:\r\n\r\nMrs. S. will be using her loan to better support her fishing business.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. makes a living by fishing and is asking for a loan to buy a boat engine to improve her business.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. will be using the Kiva loan to buy more nets and traps to fish better. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":355776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase nets, traps, and other tools for his fishing operations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Siem Reap","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.366667 103.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2009-07-20T13:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kav","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Duong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73616749,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87054686,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96969563,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103814494,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110706493,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118099113,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123935206,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128969308,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-20T17:47:19Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:13:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":123595,"name":"Daniel Nyantika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel O. is 51 years old and married to Christine.
