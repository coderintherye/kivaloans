With the money he saved, Rustam rented a store at the market called Panshanbe and began selling drinks and alcoholic products. Producers deliver goods that Rustam carries in his store.

The second location is where Muhsin's sales person mostly sells shoes. Muhsin works for an Italian company called Katri that produces fabric for making clothes. However, his salary at Katri is insufficient for supporting his family. <p>\r\n\r\nHis neighbor recommended that Muhsin apply for a loan at Microinvest in order to expand his business. Now is a season for summer clothes, and Muhsin needs to purchase goods for resale. He hopes to obtain a loan from Kiva via Microinvest in order to expand his business by purchasing seasonal men's and children's clothing.\t<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva

D. is a citizen of the Shahrinav area. He lives with his family, is married and has 4 children. He works as a veterinarian, but also is engaged in a small business. In his home he has opened a small shop where he trades food and economic goods. He has been engaged in this kind of business for 14 years. Currently he wishes to increase his assortment by increasing his commodity circulation. However this can only be achieved by receiving a loan, and that is why he has asked Kiva for help. He wants to receive a loan in the amount of 2500 somoni and plans to repay the loan within 15 months. He lives in a secluded area, therefore by increasing his business he can help the people of his region.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva

But the tranquil image is shattered by the reality of the poverty confronted in the small town of Imbert every day.  Grisel works everyday to provide meals and school materials for her three children (and a 4th on the way).  With her two small barbecues, she sets up shop at a popular intersection in town, where she sells Chicharrones (deep fried pork) and other meets.  With this loan, Grisel intends to purchase propane, paint for her BBQ, and a supply of raw meet and oils.  While her current business is selling food, she dreams of one day owning her own boutique clothing store.  \r\n<p>\r\nGrisel is the leader of a 10 person micro bank Mujeres de Fe, which means \"Women of Faith\".  Each of these unique Dominican entrepreneurs unite in solidarity, allowing them to access funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.  The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting, as the others members gladly help cover one another's payments in order to receive their next loan together.  As these 10 women embark upon their first ever loan from Esperanza, we are confident that they will all succeed in bettering their lives and the lives of their families with this loan.  One of the women in the group just began a small general store, one owns a small hair salon, and several of the others plan to sell clothing.\r\n<p>\r\nOn behalf of Grisel Yocast, the Mujeres de Fe group, and the entire team here at Esperanza International, we thank you for your support and awareness of the global issue of poverty, in which your efforts are helping to make a difference."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":181685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase paint to decorate a barbecue, propane, and pork to be sold on the street.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-08-01T19:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grisel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Altagracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crusita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Louise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-26T17:40:46Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":246,"local_amount":8338.98,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":8436.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338120,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":246,"local_amount":8338.98,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8436.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371945,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Esperanza International, a partner of HOPE International - Oct 26, 2008)"},{"amount":245.5,"local_amount":8322.03,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8419,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312788,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930335,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854909,"comment":null},{"amount":245.84,"local_amount":8333.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394191,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-12T17:40:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:13:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":56770,"name":"Luisa Elena","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"A few years ago Mrs. Luisa used to sell vegetables, now she sells clothing (sweaters, track suits, trousers, t-shirts, stocking, underwear,etc.) at the Campo VerD. market, in Yunguyo every day of the week.

To supplement the family income he also grows wheat and other grains. Mahmadnazar wants to take out a loan to finance the purchase of seeds and fertilizer for the next growing season. He also wants to purchase fuel for his equipment. The loan will guarantee that Mahmadnazar will be able to buy the best quality seeds for his fields and collect a quality harvest next year.

She has already successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan), which she used to purchase an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle) for her oldest son's business. Now, she is applying for a loan for her younger son, who is 25 years old and who wants to drive an auto-rickshaw.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe is joined in her loan group by the following individuals: (1) Khursheed baji, who wants a loan to buy vegetables; (2) Hanifan baji, who seeks a loan to buy masonry tools; and (3) Fozia baji, who requests a loan for her husband, a tailor that is in need of an over-lock machine (a type of sewing machine). <p>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. As such, the loan proceeds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. Further, the members mutually guarantee each other's loans; therefore, if one member does not repay her loan, the other members are responsible for the arrears."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":181778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

G. is among the early clients of VFC. He was born in 1979 in Eastern Province, Bugesera District. He is married and stays with his family in Nyamata Sector\/ Nyamata-city.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, G. started a small-scale business trading shoes. His business was conducted in a small house he was renting for three thousand per month (Rwf3,000). He was living in the same room with 4 orphans (2 boys and 2 girls) as a child-headed household family.  After joining VFC, his business grew, and he started to inject the small loan he obtained to purchase other items.

F. D. J. has a wonderful heart and ambitions for the growth of her business. She has used her loans to start a hair salon that has been functioning for about three years now with the help of loans. When asked about her business, she kindly smiles and offers to give me a haircut in the near future. Ms. B. F. D. J. has used her loans for purchasing materials for daily operation such as mirrors, scissors, clippers, chairs, and hair accessories. She is married with six children, three of whom live at home with her. She enjoys spending her free time with her grandson and visiting with people in her neighborhood. When asked about her favorite food, she laughs and says that she\u2019s Dominican so she must like \u201cla bandera\u201d, which is a traditional dish consisting of rice, beans, and meat. Also, when she\u2019s not working in her shop, she dedicates her time to her church and the upholding of her home. Ms. B. F. D. J. would like to see her business grow in the future to help proviD. for her and her family.<P>\r\n\r\nMs. B. F. D. J. is one of a group of 5 persons, 'Grupo 1', that is part of a micro-bank called Miramar Femenina which consists of 35 members (other members of Miramar Femenina are seen in the photo). Her story is just one of those of a list of men and women who are improving their quality of life through the help of the micro-credit loans of Esperanza. Together, this group has united with a common vision of a better life, with faith and hope in their hearts and an unbreakable spirit. The concept of group lending is to have loans repaid in a group to reduce the risk of any one person defaulting, as others pick up where a person may lag so as to receive the next loan. Each of the associates in this bank has a similar business whether it is a barbershop or a restaurant. Thank you for your support and awareness of this issue.

She has 3 children, 2 of whom are going to school. Before her participation in TYM program, her family faced many financial difficulties because the finance depended only on farming and they did not have money to invest in businesses. In 1999, she borrowed money to invest in raising pigs. For 9 years, thanks to her intelligent use of the loans, the family\u2019s business has been expanding. At the moment, they are taking care of 10 pigs and 100 chickens. She plans to borrow the next loan of 7,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to renovate the farm and buy more pigs and chickens.

Thi Thuoc, 54 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 1999. Before that, her family's income came mainly from farming. Therefore, she used the first loan to invest in raising livestock. However, the income from that project did not bring about a significant increase in income. As she is skillful and sensitive in doing business, she discussed with her husband and decided to borrow and invest in growing decorative plants. Together with raising livestock and farming, this project has brought about increasing income. Currently, she has many decorative plants with high values. This time round, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to grow more decorative plants to sell in the coming Lunar New Year.

Thi An is the owner of a general store. She is 45 years old and has been a member of the TYM Fund for 5 years. She has 6 children, 2 of whom are adults. Previously, her family's income came mainly from agriculture. After joining the Fund, she decided to invest in a general store. At first, she only had a small store with limited goods as she was new in the business. However, until now, she has expanded her store and added in a wide variety of goods to satisfy the local people's demand. Together with her family's income from agriculture, the income from the general store has improved her family's economy. This time, she would like to borrow 16,000,000VND (975USD) to invest in her general store.

Besides managing the store, her family also raises livestocks, thus the family's economy has increased over time. This time round, mrs. Hang would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to invest in her general store.
