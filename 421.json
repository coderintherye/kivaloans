Melagros is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Melagros from HSPFI.

G. is from the village of Sugarlan Valencia City. She is 32 years old. Chona is single and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Chona owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling used clothing, or ukay ukay, in the local community. Chona has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Chona joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Chona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Chona is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Chona from HSPFI.

C. is from the village of  Barandias, Pangantucan Bukidnon. She is 46 years old. Jocelyn is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Jocelyn owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Jocelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She is a single mother of four children whose ages range from 24 to 32 and only one of which, the youngest, is still in school. One of her daughters is married.\r\nShe started selling cassava in 1978 with a capital of 30,000 francs. Because working with cassava is so hard, she started selling fruit.\r\nThe sale of fruit is good business because in her country, each season produces fruit. During the rainy season there are mangos, avocados, granadillas and many other wild fruits. During the dry season there are oranges, mandarins, grapefruits and bananas.\r\nShe would like to use the current loan for a cash purchase of stocks and to buy exotic fruits, which are very expensive (e.g. litchis, mangosteens and apples.)\r\nHer daily revenues reach 35,000F during high-activity periods and decrease to 15,000F when sales slow down.\r\nIn the future, she plans to get one of her daughters started in this profitable business and to help her youngest child pursue his studies in the best conditions.\r\nHer vision is to save money and become wealthy enough to buy land where she would plant fruit trees.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

Unfortunately, he lacks the financial means to satisfy these requests. He therefore decided to join Soro Yiriwaso where he has already been granted two loans, both repaid in full.\r\nWanting to satisfy an ever-increasing customer base, he is requesting a third loan to buy 30 bags of sugar peas, one ton of corn, 5 bags of millet, and 10 bags of shea nuts.\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies from villages in the vicinity of Sikasso and stockpiles them to start with at his store in the new area of M\u00e9dine in Sikasso. He then transports the products to Abidjan (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), in response to orders from factories producing sugar pea juice and shea butter. He sells grain crereals both wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nHe hopes this loan will enable him to reach monthly earnings of 315,000 FCFA, which will be used to cover most of his own expenses, those of his family and to pay the loan interest.

D. is from the village of Kinura, Kalilangan Bukidnon.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She also sells vegetables. Helen has been engaged in her business for more than six years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Helen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen is requesting a  loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This  will be the first loan taken out by Helen from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Her long term dream is to see her children become good and successful adults as much in the spiritual way as in the material way.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":560772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Invest more in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Villa Nueva","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.526944 -90.5875","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-06-25T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.92,"local_amount":820,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":847.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159753632,"comment":null},{"amount":109.09,"local_amount":844.6,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":872.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166836912,"comment":null},{"amount":112.36,"local_amount":869.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":898.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172712531,"comment":null},{"amount":115.74,"local_amount":896.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":925.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396294,"comment":null},{"amount":89.5,"local_amount":692.92,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":715.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534848,"comment":null},{"amount":121.9,"local_amount":943.71,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":975.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137513,"comment":null},{"amount":120.49,"local_amount":932.83,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":963.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414936,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T15:19:56Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211131,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una alegre y trabajadora mujer de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, comparte su vida con su pareja y su hijo Jes\u00fas de 11 a\u00f1os en su casa propia.

She lives, together with her husband and her 11 year old son Jes\u00fas, in her own home.  For more than 2 years, Maria has been running a business selling ceviche (a typical Peruvian dish) from a stand she had built next to her house. When Maria obtained her first loan, she was able to expand her business and now prepares many other dishes requested by her customers, in addition to ceviche.  She really enjoys the meticulous process of food preparation and the challenge of working to obtain precise flavors that all of her customers will enjoy. In the future, Maria wants to continue expanding her business and in time hopes to have her own restaurant.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she has assured that she will continue being very responsible with the payments.

To make a living, Divina owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Divina has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Divina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Divina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Divina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Divina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is the mother of five children, all of whom have been educated.  Only three of her children still live at home.  Ganiatou is a widow who lives on her own with her three school aged children.  She has lived in the Finagnon quarter of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, for about fifteen years. Ganiatou has never been to school. \r\n\r\nGaniatou manages the household on her own, thanks to the income from her business. She sells assorted merchandise (pasta, canned tomatoes and sardines, milk, mayonnaise, butter, soaps, vegetable oil, salad dressings, etc.) out of her home.  Ganiatou buys her stock in Dantokpa, Benin's international market.  Ganiatou has been a client of ALID\u00e9 for some time, and has paid back her previous loans.  Because of increasing competition, Ganiatou wants to grow her business so she can have a bigger client base and generate more income.  This is why Ganiatou is requesting another loan from ALID\u00e9. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eileen Jessop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":560808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy assorted merchandise (pasta, canned tomatoes and sardines, soaps, oil, milk, etc.) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-06-27T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ganiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":190000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576219,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954733,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-29T09:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056388,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347923,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482951,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617766,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-26T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361142,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":19948.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779841,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":38000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":39897.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401647,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-27T02:55:38Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211156,"name":"Demba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Demba D. est un soci\u00e9taire  de 42 ans  de la caisse de Baye Laye qui habite dans la localit\u00e9  de Daroukhane.

She has sold tamales three times a week for two years. She sells tamales in her home and her customers already know her and seek her out. Her dream now is to raise her children and to give them a good life. \r\n\r\nBerta works selling disposable products in Ciudad Quetzal where she rents a small shop.

All of these activities proviD. her family with an income, because she sells everything in a disciplined manner with the objective of gaining income.  Andrea lives in the city of Cartagena and has a 43 year-old daughter.  She is separated and still makes an effort to work with joy and enthusiasm.  She started her business with a loan that she was given from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and thanks to this and the training she received she was able to organize and restructure her small business.  At first, she sold only miscellaneous goods.  Later, since she wanted to have more income, she also began to make empanadas, arepa (a kind of corn griddle cake), and other fried foods, which she makes very early in the mornings.  Finally, as she is a person who is aware of opportunities, she realized that selling coal was another good business, and she added that on as well, taking advantage of the fact that in the area around her home there are many fast food businesses and roasted meat sellers that need this product in order to operate.\r\n\r\nAndrea has been involved with the  Fundaci\u00f3n for 11 years.  With her loans, she has been able to get ahead along with her daughter, who she was able to proviD. with an education and who now supports her in her business.  Her goal is to always work, not only to be successful with the business, but also so that she can pay off the loans and always have her doors open.  She also wants to continue to care for her mother who depends on her economically.  She is currently applying for a loan in the amount of $1,000,000 Colombian pesos, with which she will buy coal in bulk, because in the rainy seasons it becomes scarce.  She will also restock her glass display case with cosmetics and miscellaneous products, and she hopes to make this money go far.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

They live together in their own home.  Since she was very young, Teresa has worked as a clothing-maker. At first she worked in workshops where she received a fixed salary.  This work gave her excellent experience in this field, eventually enabling her to start her own clothes-making workshop in her home, where she continues to work today.  Working from home enabled her to make dresses while also watching over her children.  Teresa makes her clothing to order, making things like jeans and pants from other materials, as well as blouses.  Lately she is only making clothes in warm fleece fabric on account of the cold winter weather.  These clothes are often sent to the interior of the country.  Depending on the amount of clothing orders she has waiting to be completed, her daughter Carmen will occasionally help her to make the clothes; although Teresa has passed her clothes-making knowledge on to her daughter, what Teresa wants most is for her to go to school to learn a profession.  In the future Teresa hopes to expand her workshop, purchasing machines and hiring staff, and herself assuming the role of a businesswoman running her own small company.  This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she has always shown herself to be very responsible with her payments.  With the loan that she requests, she will purchase material to complete the clothing orders that she has pending.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva

She started this business with her husband because she was unemployed and had just moved to San Juan Nepomuceno from another town in Bolivar.  Since receiving her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Fanny says her life changed because she had to go to Venezuela for work because she had racked up several debts.  That occurred five years ago, and now all of that is in the past.  She managed to pay off all her obligations and is now able to purchase items for her home.  By capitalizing on her innovative designs, her business has become the only one of its kind in the area.  \r\n<p>\r\nFanny is applying for her seventh loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in the amount of 2,000,000 COP in order to buy rubber, protective soles, and accessories for making new designs of sandals that are up-to-date.

She has a strong character, and this has helped to her make the decisions in her household and ensure that her children completed their education. She has two children: Oswaldo, age 23, and Nicol, age 21, and they live together in their own house. For Carmen, the role of mother always came first in her life. She only had to raise her children and make sure that they never lacked food or clothing. Today, her children are adults and have their own jobs; she is only able to enjoy being with them at lunch time. Therefore, taking advantage of her free time, she decided to dedicate herself to selling beauty products. She has done this work for the past three years, and the business is paying off well for her. She has been able to attract customers and make new friends. She very much enjoys her work; however, the only difficulty is having to walk a long way to collect the payments from her customers.

She lives with her husband and their two small children in San Jacinto, a town in the department of Bol\u00edvar.  The town is well known for producing hammocks, backpacks, and the most beautiful crafts in Colombia, and that is precisely what Noredis does in her business.  She learned this trade as a family tradition, and her job now allows her to help her family improve its quality of life.  Through her job and the help she has already received, Noredis is working so that she can purchase her own house and provide a decent life for her children.  She is also a social worker who belongs to the farmers and artisans cooperative, which has industrial sewing machines for the use of its members.  \r\n\r\nThis is Noredis\u2019s second loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.   She has participated in its programs for a little less than two years\u2014her first loan was cancelled because she invested a large part of the capital in purchasing a plot of land and had to wait to recover more of her investment.  She is now seeking a loan of 2,000,000 Colombian pesos so that she can purchase supplies such as yarn, ornaments, and lining for making handbags and yarn and ornaments for making hammocks.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house with premises for her business, and for her business to grow so that she can ensure her children\u2019s future.  The biggest challenges that Noredis faces are above all her relations with her family, since there are few employment possibilities in the town where they live.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Her life has been dedicated to raising and educating her children.  Carola earns a living as a seamstress, making all kinds of clothing for women, men and children.  16 years ago,  Carola finished studying fashion design and decided to learn a business where she could use her skills and her creative potential.  When she started, she first made clothes for women, and then gradually learned more and expanded her business to include many diverse garments.  This has given a big push to her personal and professional growth.   The income from her business has gone to cover most of their household costs.  This is her first loan with the foundation Mario Santo Domingo, and she plans to use the money to purchase various fabrics, accessories and a button machine.  Carola's dream is to have a boutique where she can show her beautiful designs and increase her income.

She has been a member of the credit union for 4 years and has already repaid 2 previous loans. She is the type of girl who likes to earn a living for herself, which is why she has spent the past 3 years running her own food stall and working in a food outlet. \r\n\r\nShe is a mobile fruit vendor who sells oranges, bananas and apples that she procures from the Sandaga market.  She also works in a food outlet, where she took over from her younger sister selling lunches. Her wish is to continue developing her business. She is therefore requesting a loan of 200 000 frs  to buy a fridge in order to store her left over fruit and keep it fresh. It will also give her the opportunity to devote her time to preparing Thiakry (sweetened snack\/dessert made from grain and fermented milk) which she will be able to sell in the evening. For Miss D., the growth of her profits will allow her to improve her savings, to better respect her commitments in regard to the tontines, and also to acquire gold jewellery.\r\n\r\n<br

He is a mason by trade. But, at the same time, he sells bricks and food products. He also rents out timber formwork and drums for water. He is the head of a family who must earn his keep and manage his family's needs, and that is why he has so many different business activities.

P. is 23 and married with no children.  She owns a business selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Epifania has 2 years of experience in this business.  Epifania needs a loan of WST$1500 to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nEpifania joined SPBD in 2009.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Epifania's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

K. is 31 and married with 2 children aged 5 and 10.  She is starting a business venture selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam). Vanimonimo needs a loan of WST$1000 to buy raw ingredients for her cooked foods. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Vanimonimo joined SPBD. This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vanimonimo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

A. is 57 and married with 8 children.  She owns a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Tiana has 1 year of experience in this business.  Tiana needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tiana joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Tiana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She plans to use the earnings  (estimated to be 450 talas or $188 USD per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Atulia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.

V. is 51 and married with 7 children (ages 3 - 21).

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Siline joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.

Fruen is 41, married, and has six children between the ages of 12 and 27.  She owns a business venture selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Mile has four years of experience in this business.  Mile needs a loan of 2,900 WST to buy raw ingredients for her cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or $208 USD per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mile joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Mile's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 57 years-old and married with seven children (aged 15 to 32 years-old).  She owns a business venture which is running a shop in her own village.  Fenumiai has four years of experience in this business.  Fenumiai needs a loan of WST $2,900 in order to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve and expand the business.\n\nIn 2005, Fenumiai joined Kiva partner SPBD.This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fenumiai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD:\n\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii andTonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 34 years-old and married with four children (aged two to 18 years-old).  She owns a business selling dairy products in the local community.  Maina has two years of experience in this business.  Maina needs a loan of WST $1,250 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maina joined Kiva partner SPBD.    This is her second loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii andTonga.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Falefou joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.

P. is 50 years-old and married with four children.  She owns a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Salome has many years of experience in this business.  Salome needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to financially support the immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Salome joined Kiva partner SPBD.  This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Salome's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii andTonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 29 years-old and married with one child.  She owns a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Penina has two years of experience in this business.  Penina needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Penina joined Kiva partner SPBD and this is her first loan with them.  SPBD loans are Penina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii andTonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 55 years-old and married with six children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 560 talas or US $233 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Susana joined Kiva partner SPBD and this is her second loan with them.

The group is made up of six members who know one another and are neighbors.  Ms. Emelia invited them to get together and they agreed to request their first loan from Fundacion Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe representative of this group is Ms. Adela B. R..  She is 40 years old and educated through the third year of secondary school.  She has four children (three boys and one girl).  Cesar is 19, Soledad is 14, Francisco is 12, and Alexis is 6 years old.  Adela sells shirts and napkins.  She is requesting this loan to buy shirts and napkins.  She started this business six years ago out of economic necessity and in order to send her children to school.  \r\n\r\nHer uncle makes crocheted tops and napkins from yarn.  She sells the merchandise in her community of Hueyapan by going from house to house offering her goods.  Her daughter helps her to collect payment from customers who owe her money.  The business has helped to feed her family and to pay her children's school expenses.  With her earnings, she buys more tops and napkins.  She would like to improve her kitchen, as she currently has only a provisional kitchen with just a roof.  She hopes to achieve this by selling more shirts and napkins.\r\n\r\nIn her community of Hueyapan, the climate is cool and there are many fruits, such as pears, chokecherries, peaches, and plums.  There is a lot of vegetation like trees, pine trees, and very beautiful flowers.  There are also many animals, like lambs, goats, etc.  Ms. Adela B. R. thanks Kiva and Fundacion Realidad for lending to her and for having confidence in her.  She hopes she will not let you down.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie Kavanagh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":560196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy blouses and napkins","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"HUEYAPAN MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-28T05:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Altagracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":129.69,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1644.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899599,"comment":null},{"amount":648.44,"local_amount":8125,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639947,"comment":null},{"amount":518.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6577.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854229,"comment":null},{"amount":518.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6577.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121126,"comment":null},{"amount":129.68,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1644.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415171,"comment":null},{"amount":129.69,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1644.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415172,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-29T06:55:33Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211376,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex M. is from the town of Sto.

She is 56 years old and has 3 children. She lives with her daughter, who is 14 years old and attends the local secondary school. Ymelda's other two sons have already left home. \r\n\r\nFrom Monday to Friday she sells popcorn, pork rinds and sweets outside the secundary school her daughter attends. The activity has enabled her to support her three children. Her husband left for Tijuana 12 years ago to work and support his family but he never came back and forgot about them. Ymelda started off by working in shops until she saved enough money to set up her own grocery business from home, but due to the competition she lost her customers and her shop. She then decided to invest in a different line of business and started to sell pork rinds and popcorn. She sells a bit of everything. On Saturday and Sunday, when there is no school, she makes stuffed chiles and sells them in town. She uses a tricycle to transport materials and produce to sell. \r\n\r\nShe requests the loan to invest in ingredients such as seeds to make popcorn, dough to make pork rinds and sweets. She would like to have a fixed business rather than be out and about as it is dangerous. She hopes to continue in this line of business because she wants to improve her house, which at the moment is largely made of cardboard. She would like to thank Fundacion for having trusted her and sent through her loan request, alongside those of the remaining members of the group. \r\n\r\nThe 11-person group is called Gardenias because the patio where they meet is surrounded by flowers of this kind and their pleasant smell caught their attention. The other group members are: Patricia V. C., who learnt to make pi\u00f1atas and handicrats for parties two years ago and has had her own business since; Irene Caba\u00f1as H., who makes snacks in her home on Saturdays and Sundays; Maria Luisa C. J., who also makes snacks; Melissa G. V., a young girl who started a business from home selling ice lollies and jelly; Mercedes C. V., who raises and sells pigs; Felicitas G. S., who sells shoes to her friends through a catalog and is getting orders in every week; Benita I. C., who sells clothes to her friends; Angela S. G., who sells sweets outside her home and tamales to her friends; Silvia H. L., who sells snacks in the school from Monday to Friday; and Elda V. F., who sells shoes through a catalog. \r\n\r\nThe Gardenias Group aims to be always on time with their payments and to keep on working as they have done until now. Although some of the members are on their own, with no help from anyone else, they support each other as friends and are glad that Fundacion is also on their side.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alba Sort , Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":560724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy ingredients for her products, such as sweets and seeds to make popcorn to sell outside the school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-28T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ymelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":37000,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":548.44,"local_amount":6937.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6953.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899600,"comment":null},{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":9250,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9271.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639948,"comment":null},{"amount":717.77,"local_amount":9079.52,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":9100.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854230,"comment":null},{"amount":927.54,"local_amount":11732.98,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":11760.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121127,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-28T21:25:49Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211383,"name":"Rodelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodelyn P. is from the town of Sto.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. First, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer youth a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and to target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

Ruth is 18 years-old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has one child who is seven months old.  Ruth has a business running a retail and grocery shop which sells small goods and food items in Kyotera.  \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Ruth is requesting a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more inventory and food  which Ruth will sell at her shop and grocery.  Ruth hopes to expand her business and sell more types of items which can draw more customers and benefit her and her family. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. First, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

Out of her income from the pigs, she was able to start a small sari-sari store where she sells food and daily use products. One of her wishes for the future is to have her three children finish college and find appropriate jobs for themselves.\r\n\r\nJenny joined Kiva partner CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jenny has successfully repaid a previous loan  from CEVI. Jenny is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jenny from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but also savings, insurance and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":561499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase livestock feed and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto Ni\u00f1o, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12823.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523872,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T15:32:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:38:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211399,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther L. is currently in the business of selling fresh and dried fish at the market and is requesting a loan to stock tomatoes and Irish potatoes to sell.

F. is from the town of Sto. Ni\u00f1o.  He is 51 years old, married and has 5 children. He still has children who go to school and he does his best to sustain their education.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Eduardo owns and operates a business raising pigs for fattening and sale. He also tills a one-hectare rice field. He says that his farm can produce 80 sacks of rice. He hopes to improve his business so he could also earn better and sustain his family.\r\n\r\nEduardo joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eduardo has successfully repaid a previous loan  from CEVI.\r\n\r\nEduardo is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase feed, baby livestock to raise and sell in future, and also farm inputs (fertilizers, etc.).

She is married to Pierre Tchenadon.  Augustine has three children, all of whom are in school.  Augustine hasn't been to school.  Augustine's family has lived in the Cocotomey quarter of Abomey Calavi for about ten years.  Together, the couple manages the needs of the household.  \r\n\r\nTo meet her family's needs, Augustine sells charcoal from her home.  She buys her coal stock in Cocotomey.  She has had this business for about fifteen years and has received one previous loan from ALID\u00e9.  Augustine repaid her first loan on time.   Now she has more clients and Augustine would like to increase her coal stock to meet their needs.  This is why Augustine is seeking a second loan.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eileen Jessop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":561523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy bags of coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-06-28T09:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Augustine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576220,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954734,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056389,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347924,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482952,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617767,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361143,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779842,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401648,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":15451.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206089340,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":30903.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211160225,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-28T10:30:38Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:30:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211410,"name":"Justine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":559275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The couple have three children who are all attending school. The family settled in the Bazounkpa neighborhood of Cotonou (the economic capital of Benin) approximately 5 years ago. Rose helps her husband and together, they cover the economic needs of their family. Rose only attended primary school. For the last four years, she has been selling cosmetic and hair products from her home. As a second source of income, she also sells a variety of products (liquors, couscous, soaps, sardines, vegetable oil, mayonnaise, toilet paper, sugar, rice, etc) from her home. The revenue from this activity allows Rose to live her life. She purchases her products from Dantokpa, the international market in Benin, as well as from Lom\u00e9, in Togo. Rose previously received a loan from ALID\u00e9, and re-paid the loan on time. She is asking for a second loan in order to enlarge her store and attract more customers in order to make more profits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, Kiva

She has had to summon up a lot of hard work and dedication for her business to make some much-needed headway.

He has fifteen hard years of experience in an apprenticeship.  He has been a member of the Baye Laye credit association since April 2006.  At present, he has noticed a slowdown in business, and this is the reason for his request for a loan of 100,000 francs in order to start up a business that will enable him to manage when his work is slow.  He is unmarried, but the revenues that will be generated from his business will allow him to help his parents and also to support himself financially.  He also intends to develop his savings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":561642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-06-29T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"El Haddji Djibril","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10595.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708777,"comment":null},{"amount":10,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5297.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708778,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922802,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189317,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484736,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620975,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758547,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495449,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923419,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365838,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206230889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-29T23:49:32Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:52:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211470,"name":"Sunday","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sunday G. is currently in the business of selling weaving materials and treating hair at the beauty salon and is requesting a loan to stock more weaving materials.

opened a little restaurant 20 years ago. She prepares local dishes like 'sakasaka', made with manioc leaves; three parts, a mixture of smoked or salted fish with 'coco' (a kind of vegetable from the Conglese forest) and peanut butter. To that she adds grilled chicken thighs or wings and meat on a spit. Her daily receipts are from 25,000 to 50,000 francs. \r\n\r\nAs her restaurant is situated in a marketplace and not far from the bus station, her potential customers are travelers and market sales people. With the loan, she intends to buy some provisions wholesale such as cartons of chicken wings and thighs, condiments to season her dishes, tins of cooking oil, sacks of onions and garlic. Also, she is thinking about repainting her restaurant and getting new tablecloths and dish towels. \r\n\r\nIn future, she is thinking about opening a big restaurant and putting aside savings so that she can build a house for her family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

groceries and bread almost 10 years ago. Very young and having no one to support him, he opened up a stall with 50,000 francs that he had saved up by selling bread. His sales amount to 15,000 to 25,000 francs a day. His strategy is to get up early and buy warm bread from the bakery, then go from door to door, calling out his wares, in the back streets of his community. At 8 am he opens his kiosk where he sells the remaining loaves of bread and other foodstuffs. \r\n\r\nWith the loan that he is counting on receiving, he is going to buy cartons of powdered milk such as \"la belle Hollandaise\" and \"Nido\" milk, a sack of 50 kg of sugar, tinned foods, and various detergents and bath soaps. \r\n\r\nHis ambition is to open up a real grocery store, to get married one of these days, and start a family. In his neighborhood everyone has known him since he was a child. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva
