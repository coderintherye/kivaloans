Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People who live there also face the cold,  difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<P>\r\nBCR \u201cHuklla Llamkasun\u201d is located in the community of A\u00f1ancusi in the district of Acoria, province of Huancavelica. The translation of the Quechua-name of the group is \u201cLet\u00b4s work as if we were one\u201d. The main activities of the population are growing tropical fruits at lower altitudes and corn, potatoes and wheat at higher altitudes. At still higher altitudes, the people are dedicated to raising bulls and cows, with alpacas and lamas at the highest altitudes. But the size of the community and its (limited) access to public transport has brought more commerce to the village; every Tuesday there is a local market where people sell and buy most of what they need.<P>\r\n\r\nThis bank has been formed recently by 17 female borrowers and therefore has no history yet\u2026. It has only just started to create history in its community! The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating from now on is for investing in their business or for the education of their children, whether it is buying school uniforms, supplies, books or even to pay the fees for entering primary or secondary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough many women dedicate their time to similar businesses, they require different loan amounts because of the differences in the size of the business they run \u2026. The loans range from 200 soles, 300 soles, up to 500 soles; the total of the loans of the 17 members is 5,400 soles (US$ 1925).<P>\r\n\r\nOne of the group members, Lucila R. Nolberta, sells fruit at local markets. Another business she runs is raising small cattle. As is the case in most families, besides her business, she dedicates most of her time to the cultivation of potatoes, wheat, and oca (a root vegetable), which she uses for home consumption. With her 200 soles loan she will be able to buy more fruits. When asked about her future, she tells us that her dream is the education of her children so they can be professionals and go on studying. She simply wants to make her life and that of her family better. With her (future) savings she plans to buy more chickens and pigs, to sell when they have grown big.<P>\r\n\r\nJuliana D. Mar\u00edn, who sells clothes and shoes in her small shop, tells us a slightly different story.  Like Lucila, Juliana grows potatoes, wheat, and other crops for home consumption. With her loan of 500 soles, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business. With more merchandise, she will be able to earn a little more and therefore save more. Her dream for the future is to live a good life with her family and her children. Her expectations in working with FINCA Peru are to learn to work harder and be more responsible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":141802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"expanding their various small businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-26T18:01:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Quetita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romualda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-10T19:54:51Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5400,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2008-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2008-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2008-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2008-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":320.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":321,"local_amount":900.47,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":902.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206677,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":321,"local_amount":900.47,"processed_date":"2008-06-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":902.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234525,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":321,"local_amount":900.47,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":902.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263244,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":321,"local_amount":900.47,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":902.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":292115,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":321,"local_amount":900.47,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":902.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322551,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":320,"local_amount":897.66,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":900.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":354898,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-03-27T19:54:51Z","paid_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41653,"name":"Kim-Ean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kim-Ean S. and her husband, Van Keo, have been married for seventeen years.

S. lives in Yavan, Tajikistan. He is 48, married with 10 children. He has no education and no regular job outside his house and raises livestock at home. He usually buys a few young bull-calves, raises them for 40-45 days and then sells them at a fair market price. After selling one or two bull-calves he buys another one or two, starts to raise them, while trying to sell the rest at the local market before they grow too big. This is one of the most popular businesses in the countryside which is especially profitable in spring and summer. Jafar has been doing this for 15 years already. Due to the bad weather this winter his business was slow and he needs a loan to buy one more bull-calf. It would help him to restore the business and to provide the income which his family needs so badly. He is planning to repay the loan in 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Sheyner, Kiva Volunteer<b><p>\r\n\u0421\u0430\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0414\u0436\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440

U. lives in Tursun-zoda, Tajikistan. She is 38, married with no children. She has a high school education and works in the private sector. She buys raw nuts (pistachio and almonds) from farmers, dries them, sorts them out and roasts  them in the oven. After this she sells nuts at the market, where she rents a sale kiosk. In spring when there is no new crop yet, prices for raw nuts are higher, so Pardahol needs more money to buy them. A loan would help her to support her business and to keep the current price of her product, which in turn would help  to keep her old customers  and to attract  new ones. Her customers would be able to buy a healthy product at an affordable price. This is why Pardahol is asking for a loan and plans to repay it in 8 months.     \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Sheyner, Kiva Volunteer<b><p>\r\n\u0423\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430

A. lives in the town Yavan. He is 24 years old, married, and has one child. He is not employed, but he is occupied by cattle breeding, which is the single source of income for his family. He usually purchases cattle, feeds it for 40 to 45 days, and then resells it for the meat market. He saw an opportunity to increase his turnover by using a loan so he turned to MLF HUMO. The loan will help him to purchase more cattle and derive an additional income that is so needed for his family. Apart from that, his customers will be able to purchase more cattle and provide the local residents with more meat. He plans to pay off the loan within 10 months. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432

She owns a small business - she bakes pastries at home and sells them in large quantities to distributors, who in turn sell her products in markets. In addition, people place custom orders and she bakes for them, as these types of products are in high  demand. In small towns and villages, people often organize celebrations and fully serve the guests. For this reason, they often buy baked products. This helps them to save money and time. Currently, Karima has one oven, which is not enough. Lack of the second oven becomes a bottleneck and prevents her from producing more. <p>\r\nShe decided to purchase a large oven, and for that reason, is asking for a loan. The credit will help her increase the volume of production and sales. Karima will be able to collect earnings earlier than before. Even a small extra amount of income will help her family improve their standard of living since she is the sole provider for her family.

A. lives in the town of Quargan-Tube. He is 37 years old, married, and has one child. He has secondary eduction. He works as a taxi driver. He owns a car, on which he plans to install natural gas system with help of a loan. This will help Mahmadi to avoid paying for gas, which became more expensive lately and made taxi business unprofitable. Moreover, he has to raise his rates. In case Mahmadi will be able to install gas system, he will decrease his rates and give residents of the region an opportunity to use taxi at affordable prices. He is planning to pay off the loan within 12 months.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432

S. lives in the town of Vahdat in Mehron. She is 46 years old, married, and has 2 children. She has secondary education and is not employed. However, she desperately wants to help her husband. Currently, her family has a cow and a calf. The cow hadn't had milk for a long time. For this reason, Gulsifat wants to obtain a credit to purchase a milk cow. This will help her increase family income since she will be able to sell milk to her neighbors. In addition, her neighbors will have an opportunity to buy fresh milk at low prices. <p>\r\nAfter she pays off the credit, she will still have a cow, that she will use for breeding to further increase the amount of cattle that the family holds. She plans to pay off the credit within 12 months.   \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430

She sells nuts (almonds and pistachios) and dried fruits at a market \"Dehkon\". She purchases the products from wholesalers and resells it in smaller quantities. She has been in this business for the last 5 years. She needs financial help to purchase the inventory. Since the new crops are not yet ready and the old crops are soon going to be all used, the prices for old crops are raising every day. Zumrad wants to obtain a loan so she could purchase enough products. This will help her keep the same prices, continue receiving steady income, and give local residents a chance to purchase her products at affordable prices.

N. lives in Gissar district.  He is 26 and married with one child.  He does not have a formal education, but he works as an on-demand apartment repairman.  This job allows him to earn money, but the work is seasonal and there is not always demand for repairs.  The money he earns is not enough to feed his family, so he also raises livestock.  He keeps a few calves which he fattens and then sells back at the market for their meat.  Umedjon has been in this business for three years.  At the moment, he needs money to buy another pair of calves and increase his sales.  He hopes to receive a loan and plans to pay it back within 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432

H. lives in Gissar district.  He is 47 and married with four children.  He does not have a formal education, but he works as an on-demand apartment repairman.  This job allows him to earn money, but the work is seasonal and there is not always demand for repairs.  The money he receives is not enough to feed his family, so he also raises livestock.  Sangimurod buys calves, fattens them over 40-45 days, and then sells them on at a profit.  He has been doing this for ten years.  This business is popular and widely accepted in rural places, and for this reason it brings him income.  At the moment, the amount of money Sangimurod can put into his business has decreased and he needs a loan to purchase more livestock.  This will allow him to re-establish his business and bring his family needed income.  He plans to repay the loan within twelve months.\r\n\r\n<b><p>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0425\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432

H. lives in Gissar district.  He is 34 and married with three children.  He does not have a formal education, but he works as an on-demand apartment repairman.  This job allows him to make money, but the work is seaonal and there is not always demand for repairs.  The money he receives isn't enough to feed his family, so in addition, he raises livestock.  He buys calves, fattens them over 40-45 days, and then sells them back at a profit.  He has been doing this for eight years.  This business is popular and widely accepted in rural places, and for this reason it brings him income.  However, due to the cold winter in Tajikistan, the amount of money Mahmadsharif can put into his business has decreased. He was forced to sell several calves in order to buy food for the others.  He needs a loan in order to buy more livestock.  This will allow him to re-establish his business and bring his family needed income.  Mahmadsharif plans to repay the loan within twelve months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer. <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0425\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432

H. lives in Gissar distrct.  He is 40 and married with three children.  He does not have a formal education.  He owns a store that sells food products.  He has been in business for about six years.  However, the store alone doesn't provide enough income for his family, so Mahmurod also raises livestock.  He buys calves and fattens them for 40-45 days, then sells them on at a profit.  This business is popular and well accepted in rural areas and for this reason, brings Mahmurod income.  At the moment, the amount of money he can put into his business has decreased, and he needs to increase the number of calves in his care.  He needs a loan to do this.   This will help Mahmurod re-establish his business and get the income his family needs.  He plans to repay his loan within twelve months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\u0425\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432

N. is a resident of the Abdurahmon Jomi region.  He is 53 years old, is a widower and has 4 children.  He has a high school education.  Because he lives alone, he carries all of the household responsibilities on his shoulders.  He needs to work a lot in order to support his family.  Abdusammad sells fruits and vegetables and has been in this business for 6 years.  He earns a small income because he has a small amount of working capital.  He is applying for a loan to increase his working capital and his income.  This will allow him to increase his income, which is so necessary for his family.  Abdusammad will pay back his loan over a 10 month period.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u041d\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432

Z. lives in the Abdurahmon Jomi region.  He is 42 years old and has 5 children.  He has a college education and works at a branch of \u201cAgroinvestbank\u201d In addition he works in agriculture.  He has a plot of land where he grows wheat and potatoes.  He has been in this business for 6 years.  <p>\r\nQuality seeds and fertilizer are necessary for planting and he does not have the resources to purchase them.  This is why he is applying for a loan.  After reaping a quality harvest, Nabijon will be able to supply the market with quality products, attract new clients and earn a good income.  In addition he will be able to supply his family with flour and potatoes for a long time, as the main food sources for the population are flour (bread and baked goods) and potatoes.  Nabijon will pay back the loan over a 10 month period.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

Thus encouraged, Sarah is requesting  a loan of Le.1,000,000 to expand her farm so that it can produce enough crops and vegetables to support her family and provide them with a sufficient income.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":142078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-03-23T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-07T00:55:12Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-05-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":203506,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":230748,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259826,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288641,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318925,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350831,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345762,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968322,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884732,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104115.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434201,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-24T00:55:12Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:54:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41817,"name":"Muhamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muhamed C. is 70 years old, but is still strong enough to do farm work.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People there have to contend with the cold, difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.<P>\r\n\r\nCommunity Bank \u201cVencedoras\u201d is located in the community of Locroja in the district with the same name, and province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are growing corn (lower altitudes), potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes) and raising cows and bulls, guinea-pigs, pigs, and chickens. <P>\r\n\r\nCurrently this community bank has completed its first loan-cycle and just half a year of existence with 11 female borrowers and a total loan of 2,500 soles (about US$ 900). The individual loans range from 100, 200, up to 300 soles. Besides repaying their loans, the group was able to save over 2,100 soles (about US$ 750) during their first loan-cycle and will continue to save in the future. For all members, the main use of the savings is for investing in their business or for the education of their children: to buy school uniforms, supplies, books, and even to pay for entering primary or secondary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nDuring their first loan-cycle, the members have learned many things: to be responsible, to save for future investment, and have received training in a variety of issues. Another thing they like is practicing values like punctuality, responsibility and solidarity.<P>\r\n\r\nOne of the group members, Nieves Aurora B. A., sells vegetables, fruit, and clothes. To earn a little more money, she also raises guinea-pigs and pigs. With her 300 soles loan, she will buy new supplies for her small business. When asked about her future, she tells us that her main dream is for her family to have a better quality of life, that she will be saving for the education of her children so they can be professionals, keep studying, and maybe in the future, even work for an institution like FINCA. What she has learned until now in FINCA is to give a name to her savings, making it easier to save more because she knows exactly why she is saving.<P>\r\n\r\nAna Marcela B., who has a small grocery store in the community and also sells clothes tells a slightly different story.  With her loan of 300 soles, she will be also able to buy more supplies for her store. Her dream for the future is for her children to study and become professionals. Besides that, she wishes to move to the city of Huancayo and build a house there, where she can have a bigger store and earn more. With her savings she wants to buy more supplies. In FINCA she has learned to respect and to be respected by the others, and has learned to save."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":142089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchasing new supplies for their various small businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-26T18:01:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Biviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nieves Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aquelina Prudencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vitaliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emperatriz Yusara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-10T03:38:20Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206678,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234526,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263245,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":292116,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322552,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":354899,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-03-27T03:38:20Z","paid_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41822,"name":"Erlinda's Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Erlinda, Estilista y Sarita have been members of the Sonrisa (Smile) Community Bank for three, three, and four months respectively.\r\n<p>\r\nErlinda, a 30 year old woman, shares her home with her four children.

They know each other well, raising their families in the same neighborhood of Chimaltenango.  The ten women represent various aspects of modern and traditional Guatemala, both in their dress and their businesses.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>About half of the women hold tight to their traditional upbringing, wearing the \"huipiles\" (traditional Mayan blouse) that they also weave to sell.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>They will use their loans to invest in buying thread in bulk, something they have not been able to purchase before. Until now, every time they receive an order for a huipil, they must travel to the market and purchase only enough thread for the one blouse. This raises the cost of the thread, because they don\u2019t receive a bulk discount, and it also is very time consuming.  Now they will be able to purchase a large amount of thread that will serve them for many months.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>These women also have small farms where they grow corn and beans, as well as raising pigs, cows, and chickens.  With part of their loan, they will purchase seed, fertilizer, and feed for the animals. <\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>The remaining women, dressed in jeans and button-down shirts, while remaining faithful to their Mayan upbringing, have also connected to the modern life in the nearby capital city of Guatemala. These women have small \"tiendas\" (shops) where they sell soft drinks, snacks, and daily necessities, such as shampoo and toilet paper. They also sell products from catalogs, mainly shoes, clothes, make-up and perfume. Their stores are a great outlet for selling from catalogs, because they already have a customer base that are coming to rely on them for other items they can order.<\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>Their loans will be used to restock their stores. They are very excited about being able to expand their variety and have full shelves. Now, they often run out of product and have empty shelves that don\u2019t look very inviting to passersby. They will also order popular items from the catalogs to have on hand in their stores, which will enable them to buy at a bulk rate and help to expand their on-hand inventory.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Whether dressed in jeans or woven skirts, the ten women have a common dream:  to better provide for their families.  They will work together over the next six months, supporting each other with loan advice and sharing ideas and best practices. While a bit nervous about taking on a new challenge, they are confident in their abilities to generate income with their new loan. They are asking for a group loan of 19,000 quetzales, about $2500 USD.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>The photo is of the ten women and their 'facilitadora' (loan officer) outside the office of Friendship Bridge in Chimaltenango."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":142133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase thread for weaving, seeds, fertilizer, and feed for animals, and inventory for stores","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-03-23T04:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafaela Maercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Norberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela Misel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-07T12:57:57Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":19000,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":416.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":417,"local_amount":3169.2,"processed_date":"2008-05-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3179.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":203470,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":417,"local_amount":3169.2,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3179.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":230711,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":417,"local_amount":3169.2,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3179.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259791,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":417,"local_amount":3169.2,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3179.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288604,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":417,"local_amount":3169.2,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3179.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318889,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":415,"local_amount":3154,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3164.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350792,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-03-24T12:57:57Z","paid_date":"2008-11-22T08:05:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41855,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Miriam is a member of Banco Comunal Juan Zaplana Belliza, and is located at Av.

De este modo desean seguir progresando y ampliar cada vez mas el negocio.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":142157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of merchandise, rice, pasta, oil, milk, eggs, baked goods, sodas, sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Luque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.266667 -57.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-03-25T14:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-10T20:03:21Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2008-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2008-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2008-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2008-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":454545.45},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454545.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-04-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193842,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-05-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221791,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-06-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250976,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279640,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-08-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":309201,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5317994,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9936513,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:47:12Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860133,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.45,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20401490,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":454545.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":458200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27093619,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-27T20:03:21Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T18:48:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41869,"name":"S\u00e9bastienne","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Born in COTONOU around 1975, Mrs O.

They will invest their loans in beads and string, which they purchase from a market in Solol\u00e1.

Mamadalieva who is 37 years old, is married and has two children. She has secondary education and sews and sells national Tajik dresses. Her husband went to the Russian Federation to find work so she now has the responsibility of the only caretaker in her family. She has a very big experience in this field because she has loved sewing since she was very young and it has been the main source of income for her family. F. started taking out loans at MicroInvest in 2005 and step by step began to purchase materials wholesale and make European clothing. In the future she plans to open a sewing shop and hire more employees. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva
