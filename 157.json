This service is always in demand in Wome as there is no electricity in this village and people must often travel further than walking distance.  Koffi has asked for this loan through Kiva, so that he can buy a new motorcycle. This would allow him to provide a better service to his customers.  With the profits he will earn from his business, Koffi can continue to send his children to school and provide for his wife and family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":234971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

He is a professional farmer and, from back when he started his business, he has always wanted to improve his business.<P>\r\n\r\n In the town where he lives, when any of the agricultural men face any difficulties, they come and ask IMON to help with their problems.

He is grateful for this loan process.

His wife is an agricultural engineer and works in MAGFOR.  For the past four years, Mr. C. has worked in the local municipality as Project Director.  He is requesting his first loan in order to improve his home, installing a ceramic floor since it is currently quite slippery; he would also like to put up blinds and glass in the windows as they currently only have bars covering them.  His dream is to improve his home since his children are growing, both physically and intellectually.  One will graduate soon in engineering, another is in his second year of college and the third is in his 3rd year of high school.  Mr. C. would like his children to feel fulfilled in their home and see it in good condition with comfortable accommodations.

She has two college educated children who are both currently priests.  She lives with her husband who works in BANCENTRO in Santo Tomas and must travel daily.  She is requesting her second loan from AFODENIC in order to improve her home by painting it and repairing the inside as far as the loan will allow.  If she can't afford it all with the loan, she will prioritize painting it and will request other loans to finish the rest.  She had never used loans before but now feels encouraged by her interactions with AFODENIC and she will continue to work with them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva

The fare to and from Freetown is Le 30,000 and a single bale will cost him Le 3,000 to transport back to Makeni.   \r\n\r\nThe only challenge Abdul is facing in his business is that of occasional slow sales. The people of Makeni struggle to generate the discretionary income necessary to purchase fresh bed sheets from Abdul. Also, a challenging rain or dry season can also impede sales. Apart from this, business is going well for him and he loves doing it. His goal now is to be able to buy a plot of land so that he can start building a house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":235165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy five bales of second-hand bed sheets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-07T05:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mahawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968677,"comment":null},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885060,"comment":null},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434518,"comment":null},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128902,"comment":null},{"amount":167.49,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025691,"comment":null},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611603,"comment":null},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008495,"comment":null},{"amount":167.51,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230838,"comment":null},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662610,"comment":null},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":503002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102845,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-18T22:04:36Z","paid_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78264,"name":"Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sr. Marlene tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en La Primavera, casada su esposo es conductor de trasporte pesado, tiene tres lindo hijos de 2, 18 y 20 a\u00f1os de edad, dos ellos estudian en un colegio de la capital.

It was founded in 1955 by the Catholic missionaries. Today, it has a total of 250 pupils with a staff of twelve teachers and administrators. This school is proud that they almost always earn a 98-100% pass rate on the National Primary School Exams (NPSE).\r\n\r\nRC Boys had never got a loan from SMT before.  They heard of SMT from colleagues in other schools who have benefited greatly from SMT\u2019s services. They decided to form a group and send in an application to SMT requesting a loan after hearing these other success stories. With the loan, some of the staff members will start a small business and those who are already run small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children's education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  \r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nFifty-nine year old Augustine J.

One is in class three, one in junior secondary school III (JSS III) and three are in senior secondary school III (SSS III). Augustine will use his loan to purchase house building materials, specifically cement for bricks. In Magburaka town, where he will do this purchase, a bag of cement will cost him Le 36,000. Augustine will use the loan to buy as many bags of cements as the loan can offer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":235357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"Purchasing house building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-07T11:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Augustine J.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry R.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brima ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacinta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Augustine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":13200000,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":440,"local_amount":1320000,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1321320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968681,"comment":null},{"amount":172.5,"local_amount":517500,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":518017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885064,"comment":null},{"amount":1147.5,"local_amount":3442500,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3445942.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128906,"comment":null},{"amount":440,"local_amount":1320000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1321320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025695,"comment":null},{"amount":1475,"local_amount":4425000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4429425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008499,"comment":null},{"amount":285,"local_amount":855000,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":855855,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662613,"comment":null},{"amount":440,"local_amount":1320000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1321320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102848,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-09T02:45:14Z","paid_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78297,"name":"Slmb Ii Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are teachers from the Sierra Leone Muslim Brotherhood (SLMB II) Primary school in Magburaka.

Three of his children are in primary school and three in secondary school. Francis will invest his loan in business. He has already been in business for two years now. He buys and sells palm oil, ground-nuts and rice. With this loan, he will invest all of it in palm oil alone. He is expecting to be able to get at least twenty-five \u201cbarters\u201d of palm oil (five gallons of palm oil make one barter). He purchases the palm oil in the nearby village of Makump, about nine miles round-trip from Magburaka.  A barter of palm oil costs something between Le 40,000 and 50,000. There are no constant prices; prices fluctuate depending on the season and the availability of the palm oil. Francis is very excited about this loan as the profit it will generate for him will make him \u201cfeel like I\u2019ve been a successful somebody in life.\u201d

I Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are teachers from the Sierra Leone Muslim Brotherhood (SLMB I) Primary school in Magburaka. It was founded in 1961 and named after its founding mission. The SLMB School is made up of classes one through three. They cater to children between the ages of six and eight.  SLMB II caters to children between the ages of nine and twelve (classes four-six).  SLMB I has a total of 225 pupils with a staff of fourteen teachers and administrators. \r\n\r\nSLMB has never got a loan from SMT before.  They heard of SMT from colleagues in other schools who have benefited greatly from SMT\u2019s services. They decided to form a group and send in an application to SMT requesting a loan after hearing these other success stories. With the loan, some of the staff members will start a small business and those who are already run small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects. \r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (though this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nFifty-one year old Brema S. K. is the deputy head teacher at SLMB.  He was born in Masoko, on the outskirts of Magburaka town. He is married with four children. Two of his children are in primary school and the other two have already finished their schooling. Brema will use his loan in the construction of a home. He plans to buy bundles of corrugated iron zinc for roofing, nails and bricks for a strong foundation. In Magburaka, where he will make these purchases, a bundle of corrugated iron zinc will cost him Le 210,000, a box of nails Le 18,000 and each brick will cost him Le 500.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":235363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"Purchasing roofing, nails and bricks for construction of a home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-07T12:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brema","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A.i.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abu Bakar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abu Bakar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":9500000,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":317.5,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":953452.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968683,"comment":null},{"amount":79.38,"local_amount":237500,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":238363.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885066,"comment":null},{"amount":873.13,"local_amount":2612500,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2621994.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128908,"comment":null},{"amount":317.5,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":953452.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025697,"comment":null},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":2375000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2383631.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008501,"comment":null},{"amount":158.74,"local_amount":475000,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":476726.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230843,"comment":null},{"amount":317.5,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":953452.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662615,"comment":null},{"amount":317.5,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":953452.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-08T19:10:44Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:21:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78299,"name":"Merilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A little \"sari-sari\" (variety) store is hoping to continually do well in Barangay Southern Poblacion.

She has worked as a caretaker at the Jacinto Hern\u00e1ndez Hospital for the past 19 years.  She is a single mother of two children.  Her older child is 16 years old and in the 3rd year of secondary school and her younger child, a daughter, is ten and in the 4th year of primary school.  Despite being a person of scarce financial resources and limited income, she has demonstrated herself as a very responsible, honest, and hard-working woman.  She feels very grateful to AFODENIC since, with previous loans, she has managed to improve her home which was in a state of disrepair.  Her wishes are to have a healthy family and to enjoy stable employment. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

is married to Nkain Cletus, and they are blessed with six children, two of which are below 15 years of age. They live in a three-room house in Nanga-Street, a quarter in Bamenda-NW regions in Cameroon. Immaculate has decided to work extra hard to assist her husband to address the needs of such a big family. She has faced so many challenges in life such as inadequate funds to sustain her business project and ill health. These challenges made life uncomfortable for her, until 18th September 2007 when she discovered GHAPE and became a member. In that same year, Immaculate received her first loan of 40,000FRS and her repayment was successful. The profit she made was plowed back into her business capital of buying and selling. \n\nGiven a loan, she plans to buy firewood for 50,000FRS, dry corn and groundnuts for 46,500FRS, two buckets of groundnuts for 16,0000FRS, koki beans for 21,000FRS, two bags of salt, and magi for 27,500FRS and transportation for 29,000FRS.  She plans to contribute 90,000FRS ($180 USD) of her own personal savings in order to carry out this business plan.  \n\nImmaculate will start repayments from the day the loan is disbursed.  She is quite convinced the business will succeed because of her manner of approach to her customers, the way she usually displays her goods and the experience she is already having in the business.

They live in a rented house with two nephews \u2013 one is 17 years old and the other is 6 \u2013 the oldest of whom goes to school.<p>\r\nChico has a salary of 4700 MZN and despite having a lot of expenses, he still manages to save 500 MZN a month and has managed to buy a piece of land in Boane with his savings on which to build his own house. However, due to the high cost of living he hasn\u2019t managed to begin the construction and in 2007 when he came across Hluvuku when they opened a branch in Namaacha and was able to obtain financing.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is Chico\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first loan, for 15000 MZN, was used to purchase construction materials to begin the building works and this second loan, for 20,000 MZN, will be used for the same purpose. He is confident that he will pay it back before it is due and will request another loan to build a stall at his house from which he will sell necessities in order to increase his family\u2019s income. In the future, Chico intends to complete his studies so that he can have a stable salary.<p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ines Teles, Kiva

She went to live in the home of her husband.  Years later she separated from her husband and consequently was able to arrange a job in a military music school.  She then found a place in the Ministry of the Interior.  In 1994 she was discharged and entered the police force.

He is 59 years old.  He went to school until the 2nd grade under the old system.  He is the father of 3 children with ages between 17 and 22.  The two oldest are at home, and the youngest is in school.\r\n\r\nAlbino began his studies when he was 15 years old, but after finishing the 2nd grade he had to interrupt school due to the bad treatment from his teachers at his school.  Of course he was not very assimilated because his ancestors did not have the financial conditions being that they were country folk.  He left Ch\u00f3kwe for Maputo in search of work.  Having arrived in Maputo he was able to arrange a job at the Hotel Rovuma as a servant and worked for 5 years.\r\n\r\nBecause he salary did not satisfy his necessities he abandoned his job after having had a proposal to work in the Hotel Libombos in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  He only worked there 2 years because it was not a very good work environment.  His colleagues alleged that he did not deserve the responsibilities he was given and he had to leave.\r\n\r\nBut with the funds collected and with the help of his mother who is a dressmaker, Albino started his own tailor and shoe shop, an activity that he learned from the sister missionaries when he was still attending school.  Today he is the owner of a shoe store and tailor called \"Chapo-Chapo\".\r\n\r\nHe works from 7:00am until 6:00pm except on Wednesdays and Saturdays because he goes to the informal market 2 times per week.  He makes more income from the shoes.  Of course many people need his services during the rainy season because the shoes become unglued frequently due to the muddy clay that made sense during that time.\r\n\r\nHe has had a monthly income of 5,000MT and is able to save 1,500MT because he is not responsible for anyone else.  He is the only one in his family that survived the 16 year war.\r\n\r\nThis is Albino's second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 5,000MT was used to purchase a machine to clean shoes, and he is asking for this second loan of 11,000MT to purchase a sewing machine because since the beginning of the year he has had many orders for school uniforms, and he intends to satisfy the necessities of his customers in full and bring in more money as well.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

Chegado a Namaacha continua com seus estudos e faz a 11\u00aa classe, porque o custo de vida sobe cada dia que passa , Hilario pede emprestado um valor no seu tio e comec\u00e7a a praticar o seu pr\u00f3prio neg\u00f3cio de venda de cal\u00e7ados no mercado informal da Namaacha (vulgo shoprite) que funciona 2 vezes por semana e consegue entao construir a sua pr\u00f3pria casa.

He studied until the 11th grade.  He is married and the father of 3 children:  the first is 8 years old, the second is 5, and the youngest is a new born of only 2 weeks.  The two oldest kids are students.\r\n\r\nHilario left V. for Beira with his parents who were in the miltary when he was only 2 years old.  He lived there for 15 years and was able to complete the 6th grade.  His father was transferred to work as a policeman in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, and he came with his family.  Arriving in Namaacha he was able to continue with his schooling and completed the 11th grade.  Since the cost of living was increasing every day Hilario borrowed money from his uncle and began his own business selling shoes in the informal market of Namaacha (known as Shoprite) that operates 2 times per week.\r\n\r\nHe was able to construct his own home.  Years later he was contracted to work in the Moseg as security of TDM in the same district.  Because of this he had to interrupt his business since his work schedule conflicted with the market days, and that caused him to go bankrupt.\r\n\r\nToday he is a worker for Moseg, and he earns monthly salary of 1,800MT working in shifts, one period of 24 hours per day 3 times per week.  He is unable to save any money because he earns so little.  In 2007 he found out about Hluvuku as soon as they opened a branch in Namaacha, and he had the opportunity to obtain a loan for 7,000MT.\r\n\r\nThis is Hilario's second loan through Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 7,000MT was used to purchase shoes that he would resell at the informal market before work, and he is asking for this second loan of 10,000MT to purhase construction materials.  He is confident that he can repay this loan before its term so he can request another loan in order to construct a stand in his home to sell various staple products.\r\n\r\n<br

from M. C. in Kigali city the capital of Rwanda! M. is 22 years old and married with two children, one adopted.\r\n\r\nM. C. started her business some time back with her capital of 300 Frws. She accumulated savings of 4500 Frws (8$) and started a new business of selling spinach (cassava leaves commonly called Isombe), avocados and bananas, carrying them on her head in the basket. As her business grew, she was able to switch to a more profitable business, selling shirts in the local markets as a hawker.\r\n\r\nShe is currently selling shoes in a closed shop. She buys them from Uganda in bulk since they are cheap compared to Rwanda.

Sekali panen I Nengah Widana mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 2.000.000.- setelah dikurangi seluruh biaya yang diperlukan untuk pengolahannya. Jadi selama 1 tahun I Nengah Widana mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 6.000.000.- Semua keuntungan tersebut dipergunakan untuk biaya kehidupan setiap hari, menabung, memperbaiki rumah dan membayar pinjaman yang dimilikinya. I nengah Widana merasa sangat mersyukur dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya karena penghasilannya bisa meningkat sehingga ia bisa meningkatkan kesejahteraan keluarganya.\nSaat ini musim hujan sudah tiba dan I Nengah Widana berencana untuk mendapatkan pinjaman kembali dengan jumlah yang lebih banyak karena ia berencana untuk menyewa lahan untuk ditanami jagung sehingga keuntungannya bisa meningkat.\n","en":"I Nengah Widana had already repaid the loan of the first phase.  That loan was used to purchase fertilizer and corn seedlings of superior quality.  Currently his cornfield has just been harvested.  The 1-hectare plot of land he owned is entirely cultivated with corn.  Within a year, I Nengah Widana is able to harvest 3 crops of corn.  Each harvest I Nengah Widana generate income of Rp. 2.000.000.- (about USD200) after deducting all payments needed for cultivation of the crop.  Therefore in a year I Nengah Widana generated income of Rp. 6.000.000.- (about USD600).  The entire mentioned income is used to pay daily living expenses, savings, for home improvement and repay loan he possess.  I Nengah Widana is very thankful with the loan he received as his perquisite continued to increase until his family\u2019s welfare improved.  At the moment is the rainy season thus I Nengah Widana planned to procure another larger loan as he planned to lease land to cultivate corn thus increasing his income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Pheng Tan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":236379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Lease land, fertilizer and superior quality corn seedlings (Menyewa lahan, pupuk dan bibit jagung kwalitas unggul)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T08:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Nengah Widana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":6000000,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":6139650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973922,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T11:37:17Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78486,"name":"Brooms, Foods Group","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb V\u1ee5, sinh n\u0103m 1957 (Ms:010105030041 ) tham gia vay v\u1ed1n m\u1ee9c 3.180.000 vn \u0111, ch\u1ecb hi\u1ec7n \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng m\u1eb9 ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 c\u00f4 con g\u00e1i l\u1edbn \u0111\u00e3 \u0111 l\u00e0m.

Selama satu musim tersebut, I Komang Sujana memperoleh cukup keuntungan dan keuntungan itu dipergunakannya untuk memperbaiki rumahnya, khususnya bagian dapur yang belum selesai direnovasi dan sebagian lagi ditabung untuk biaya sekolah anaknya. Karena selama satu musim menekuni usaha berjualan pupuk, lahan miliknya sendiri hampir terbengkelai dan tidak terurus. Saat ini sedang musim hujan dan waktu yang tepat untuk bercocok tanam. I Komang Sujana segera mengambil inisiatif untuk kembali mengerjakan lahan miliknya sambil tetap berjualan pupuk. I Komang Sujana memerlukan dana untuk biaya pengolahan tanah, karena untuk mengolah lahan seluas 1,5 hektar miliknya, ia memerlukan tenaga kerja tambahan yang dibayar per hari sebesar Rp. 25.000.- Biasanya memerlukan waktu selama 5 hari untuk siap ditanami padi. Selain untuk biaya tenaga kerja, dana tersebut dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit padi kwalitas unggul karena I Komang Sujana mengharapkan hasil yang maksimal. Dengan masa panen selama 3 kali setahun, I Komang Sujana optimis usahanya bisa sukses dan segala usaha yang dilakukannya untuk mensejahterakan keluarganya.","en":"In the previous year\u2019s growing season, I Komang Sujana was diligent in his fertilizer and pesticide-selling venture.  In the season mentioned, I Komang Sujana acquire adequate income and that income was used to improve his home, specifically the kitchen where the renovation is unfinished and the balance saved for the children\u2019s education expenses.  As during the season diligently selling fertilizer, his land is next to uncompleted and derelict.  Currently the rainy season is appropriate and suitable time for planting.  I Komang Sujana immediately take the initiative to resume working on his land while selling fertilizer.  I Komang Sujana require funds to pay for the preparation of the land, as to cultivate the 1.5-hectare land he owned, required extra labor costing Rp. 25.000.- (about USD2.50) per day.  Usually requiring a period of 5 days to complete planting with paddy.  Besides paying for the labor, the mentioned funds are used to purchase superior quality paddy seedlings as I Komang Sujana hope for maximum yield.  With 3 harvests per year, I Komang Sujana is optimistic his venture will be successful and all his effort expended to better the family\u2019s welfare.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Pheng Tan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":236393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Hire labor and purchase superior quality paddy seedlings (menyewa tenaga kerja dan membeli bibit padi kwalitas unggul)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T08:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Komang Sujana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":6000000,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6139650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973923,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T19:51:08Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78488,"name":"Phen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phen L., 76, is a widow and the mother of one daughter, aged 46, who works with her.

This is her first time participating in the Binh Minh fund.  She joined with a loan of 1,972,000 VND to buy bamboo to weave brooms.  Her husband works as labor for hire every day and gets paid daily.  Her family's average income is 2,500,000 VND per month.

Seluruh lahan yang dimilikinya ditanami dengan padi, karena pengairan yang cukup memadai sepanjang tahun. Selama 1 tahun, tanaman padi bisa dipanen sebanyak 3 kali. Sebelumnya, I Ketut Keder menanam padi dengan bibit jenis lokal karena harganya yang lebih murah. Namun, keuntungan yang didapatnya tidak maksimal, karena bibit jenis lokal mudah terserang penyakit. Dalam satu kali panen ( 4 bulan ), ia hanya mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 500.000.- setelah dikurangi semua biaya untuk pengolahan tanah dan perawatan tanaman. Hal itu dirasakan belum mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya, apalagi dengan kondisi ekonomi saat ini. Karena ingin meningkatkan taraf hidupnya dan keluarganya, I Ketut Keder mengajukan pinjaman ke Yayasan Dinari sebesar Rp. 6.000.000.- Pinjaman tersebut dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit padi kwalitas unggul sebesar Rp. 3.000.000.-, biaya pengolahan tanah dengan menyewa pekerja sebesar Rp. 1.000.000.- dan membeli pupuk serta anti hama sebesar Rp. 2.000.000.- I Ketut Keder sudah belajar dengan petani yang sudah lebih dulu menggunakan bibit kwalitas unggul sehingga ia tidak ragu untuk mendapat pinjaman, karena sesuai dengan kenyataan, bibit padi kwalitas unggul mampu menghasilkan hingga 3 kali lipat dibanding dengan bibit jenis lokal. Satu kali panen, bibit unggul bisa mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 1.500.000.- hingga Rp. 2.000.000.- Dengan terus didampingi oleh staf Dinari dan petani padi yang telah sukses dengan bibit padi kwalitas unggul, I Ketut Keder optimis yakin ushanya kan sukses.","en":"I Ketut Keder owns a land of 1.5 hectares (around 3.7 acres). Due to his land does not have a proper irrigation system, he uses his whole land for paddy farming. He can harvests his paddy farming 3 times a year. He used local paddy seeds in the past because they were cheaper. However he was not able to get a good result out of it. In one harvest season (around 4 month period) he can only get a profit of IDR 500 thousand (around USD 45). That was certainly not enough to make a living especially in this current economic condition. <p>\r\nI Ketut Keder wants to improve his family welfare and therefore he applied for a loan from Dinari foundation for an amount of IDR 6 million (around USD 550). He used IDR 3 million (USD 275) to buy high quality paddy seeds, another IDR 1 million (USD 92) was spent for hiring some men to clear and work the land, and IDR 2 million (USD 183) to buy fertilizer and pesticide. <p>\r\nI Ketut Keder has learned from senior farmers in farming with high quality seeds, hence he is confidence he can succeed this time. He can triple his revenue using this quality seeds, so instead of having a profit of UD 45 per harvest seasons, he can earn up to USD 135 - USD 180\/ harvest season. In addition he also gets a continuous support and guidance from Dinari foundation's field instructor so he is even more confidence that he will succeed this time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":236448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy high quality paddy seeds, fertilizer and pesticide B","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-12-18T22:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Ketut Keder","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":6000000,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6139650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973927,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-19T07:18:59Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78498,"name":"Theresia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Born in 1960, Mama B.

She is a grocer who owns a small store in the local market.  \r\n\r\nShe now wants to expand her business and improve her family's living conditions.  Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to purchase grocery goods.  \r\n\r\nHer husband, Mr. Ouk Sanh, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate both rice and vegetables.  Mrs. Suor C. is 51 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom is a farmer while the others are attending the local school.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans.  Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.  These five members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

For now, he's living with his in-laws.  He's worked in farming since he was a boy.  His father died when he was 13 and he's supported his mother since by working in the fields.  Since starting his own family, he works for his mother part of the time and for his own family part of the time.  The happiest days for him are market days because he can sell the potatoes that he grows and collect the money that he's earned.  He then returns to plant again.  The rest of his time is spent growing, harvesting and sorting potatoes.  He would like to rent a space in the main market.

Beatrice believes the loan would help her increase her savings towards the welfare of her two children who are in school now. She is a member of the group called Boldness. Members in the group agree in unison to guarantee for each other to repay the loan. She does not sell on group meeting days and her picture was taken during her group meeting.

She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location (right on the main road), the quality of her products, and her reasonable prices. She buys in bulk which causes the price to be minimal and sews things herself with the help of her husband. She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \r\n \r\nPart of the profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of M.'s children.

He plants potatoes and other produce, but she didn't want to plant potatoes because it requires such a large investment and the market price is not satisfactory. But this season, at least, the price of fertilizers has fallen from 215 to 185 soles, and she hopes the price will hold steady so she can recoup her investment.

She has always worked in agriculture.  Years ago, together with her husband, she grew potatoes in large quantities on the coast and in the mountains.  When they had enough money saved up, they bought a car to transport their products.  But then came some bad times when their production didn't mature because of insects, or the rains affected their plantings and they lost them.  Most recently, they have had to deal with the increase in the price of fertilizers, so this year they have grown very little.  She also is raising cattle, and she already has a good number of them.  She considers them more profitable than growing crops.  She only has to grow oats in large quantities to feed the animals, and with what she has, she has enough to last a long time.  Also, in the market in her area, she sells the milk that her cattle produce daily and cheese that she makes.  This is her seventh loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She is a client who pays back her loans in a punctual manner.  With the money she is requesting, she is going to purchase cattle of a good breed, so she can capitalize on the larger quantity of milk they will produce, and therefore make a larger quantity of cheese.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":236681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of cattle of a good breed so they will produce more milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-13T20:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210683,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-14T21:06:08Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78610,"name":"Yaroslav","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaroslav sells household items, such as dishware, disposable goods and plastic bags, in one of the local markets of his home town of Zaporozhye.

Currently, his daily profit is about 250 Grivnas.  \r\n\r\nSergyi realizes his bus needs maintenance. At the moment its running gear has to be fixed. Moreover, Sergyi would like to buy winter tires and an accumulator unit. That is why Sergyi is requesting a loan of 6,000 Grivnas to fix the problem. One of his long-term plans is to continue improving living conditions of his family and provide for their basic needs. Sergyi is hoping to repay this loan in twelve months.

She has enjoyed sewing since she was very young.  She had the opportunity to study dressmaking, which she does from home with her neighbours as her clients, who also refer her other clients.  Her husband works buying and selling fruit and when he is not home because he needs to get more fruit, she stays to sell them.  She tells us that she does not like this business very much because it is risky travelling from one place to another, but that as in any marriage, they support one another in their endeavours.  Her husband's business is highly profitable, and so she supports him and the income it generates allows them to live very comfortably.  This is her 5th loan with Microfinanzas Prisma; she has shown that she is punctual in her payments.  She will use the loan to buy more fruit in bulk directly from the farms, as well as pay to make crates for the transport of the fruit.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva

In the future she wants to buy a grill to sell anticuchos (a dish with small pieces of grilled skewered meat) at night since her mother\u00b4s house is in a very high-traffic area.

This is 39-year-old Veronica Millinga from Kyela. She is married with 2 children, aged 11 and 13.

She buys crops from farmers and bring them to town where she can sell them at higher price.  She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by three family members. <p>\r\n\r\nVeronica currently earns about 150 USD a month from her business.

Veronica  thanks you for your support!\r\n \r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":236735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase 50 bags of rice in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T13:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica J.
