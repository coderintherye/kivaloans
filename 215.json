Th\u1ecb is a 44 year old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Minh is the group leader of a 7 member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02 \u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i (16.02.02).\r\n\r\nMinh is married and has 2 school-aged children. To making a living, Minh owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising cattle for sale. Minh has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 900.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Minh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Minh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Minh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Oa is a 46 year old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\n2.  N.

L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Th\u1eafm is a 26 year old female who is requesting a 3.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the food sector making & selling food.\r\n\r\n5.  L\u00ea Th\u1ecb B\u00ecnh is a 37 year old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\n6.  N. Th\u1ecb Xu\u00e2n is a 43 year-old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\nNote: Many FPW borrowers have expressed a desire to borrow larger amounts to make more significant investments in their businesses. In response to this, FPW has recently added a new loan product of 6.000.000 VND with a 20 month term to its Thanh Hoa City branch portfolio. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nMinh N.

Being a very hard working woman, Victorine has had to overcome some challenges in life such as her husband losing his job and the ill health of her children.\r\n\r\nVictorine runs a small poultry farm in her compound with the support of her children and husband. Besides this, her daughter is also a seamstress. She will invest in her workshop by buying her a sewing machine. With this loan, she plans to buy more fowls, feeds, oil, cocoyam, fish, and cultivate vegetables.\r\n\r\nThis will be Victorine sixth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2001.

She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \r\n \r\nPart of the profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of Victorine\u2019s children. The other part will be used for completion of her house for the family. Victorine does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments every month. She intends to start repayment in the fourth month after taking the loan. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

doing the gardening. He liked helping planting seeds and trees, and he especially enjoyed harvesting. Therefore, when he was young, he got involved in agriculture, an occupation which is still quite profitable these days. In addition to agriculture, he sells potatoes and carrots at Hujand's market. He brings the vegetables from Istaravshan. His brother and wife help him with the business. Hamrokul submitted an application for an eight-month loan of 1500 somoni. He would like to use the loan for planting onions, which he could later sell at Hujand market.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Oksana Buranbaeva, Kiva

It is very important to point out that his business requires a lot of effort, which is why he dedicates himself to growing potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. This requires a lot of exposure to the sun as well as moving the product long distances. The reason why Mirzoali is requesting a loan from IMON International is to invest in technological assistance in cultivation. With this loan he will be able to succeed and have better opportunities for the sale of his products after the harvest. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B.  is 53 years old. She is married with 9 children. Together with her husband (pictured) and sons Bibinor is running a manufacturing business. They are producing  wooden doors and window frames. The shop is located right in their house. Mostly Bibinor takes part in selling their production at the market. Working in this business for 19 years, Bibinor and her husband have become rather experienced masters. Producing goods of good quality and acceptable prices Bibinor has got many customers. In general the business is successful and generates a stable incomes for the family. Now Bibinor is planning to hire an additional woodworker required for expansion of her business. With this purpose she requests 4000 Somoni. Her goal is to continue expanding and improving their family business every day, and, more importantly, to ensure that her younger children will always be able to attend a good school. Bibinor is very grateful to everyone who is helping her to achieve her dreams with this loan. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. is 43 years old. She has been married for about 20 years. Ruabso together with her husband (pictured) has been running her business for about 12 years. She rents a retail store where she sells different kinds of housewares. Her business is the main source of income. As a rule Ruabso travels to the neighboring town to purchase the goods. She always tries to have a wide range of goods of good quality to meet the requirements of her customers and to satisfy the needs of clients with different levels of income. Today, Ruabso requests 2000 Somoni for the term of 10 months. This is the tenth time that she has asked for a loan through IMON. The loan will be used to buy more housewares in order to increase the variety of her goods. Due to the profitability of her business, the determination of this micro entrepreneur and her experience in the business, this customer is qualified to receive this loan. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her husband is a private employee. Because it is hard for them to survive if only her husband is working, she decided to engage herself in selling. \r\n<p>\r\nShe started a sari-sari (mini-grocery) store with a small amount of capital. Their primary customers are their neighbors. She was successfully able to manage it well, and able to finance the daily needs of her family with the help of Paglaum Cooperative. She was able to take two loans at a time but has paid them all religiously. Now she applies for a loan of PHP 35,000 to finance the purchase of additional stock for her sari-sari store. She is looking forward to expanding her sari-sari into a general-merchandise store someday.

And so Gemma thought of an economic project that would generate additional income. <p>\r\n\r\nCooking is her favorite household chore. That\u2019s how she got the idea of selling cookies and bread. In October 2008, she joined Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative for a chance to take a loan. She\u2019s happy that the cooperative has extended their services to the needy members. From then on, she gained more customers and generated daily income. Today, she is applying for PHP 20,000 for additional capital for her cookie- and bread-making business. Seeing all her children succeed in life is her greatest

in 1957, Anna is married to a very supportive husband. They are blessed with six children. They have some challenges because of the rural exodus for greener pastures in the urban city of Bamenda. Farmland is scare or far from their residence in Ntabesi, a quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon. This made them have to trek a very long distance for farming. \r\n<p>\r\nHer desire to give her children love and the best education motivated her to become a GHAPE member in 2002. Her past loan investments are still yielding good dividends. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of a motorbike, frying of gateaux (small cakes) and a piece of farmland. Anna plans to actively involve her entire family in the implementation phase of her business.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the profit from this loan, Anna plans to take care of her family, ensure that they eat well and buy their medication. She knows very well that she will be able to repay this loan because of the low interest rate and the lengthy repayment period. Moreover, last year Anna was able to have savings, through which she acquired a piece of farmland.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE, a Kiva partner, works toward the empowerment of the poor and toward poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  \r\n\r\n

is married and has seven children, five of whom are still in school. She and her family live in a three-room house with a broken roof and they are in the middle of the rainy season. Martha did not have the opportunity to get a good education as her father died when she was only a kid. This forced her into an early marriage. Added to this, her husband has been having health problems for the past couple of years, leaving her to do all that it takes to keep the family going. She joined GHAPE, a Kiva partner, in 2004 and has since received and repaid loans amounting to 220,000 CFA ($440). \r\n<p>\r\nGiven a loan of 150,000 CFA, she plans to buy three piglets, pig feed and palm oil for retail. Palm oil is a basic commodity as almost all households use it on a daily basis. This is an indication that there is a ready market. The profit she gets from the loan shall be used to see her children through their academic career and to repair the broken roof of their house which leaks every time it rains. \r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to repay the loan in 18 months and the first installment of repayment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of loan disbursement.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and toward poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

on January 25, 1942, Pa Nfoh Michael is married to Ma Nfoneh Margaret and they have been blessed with three children, one of whom is still under 15 years of age. Pa M. and his family live in a seven-room apartment in Ntasem neighborhood in Nkwen.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to circumstances beyond his control, Pa Nfoh didn\u2019t have the privilege of a basic education or an apprenticeship to learn a trade, because his parents were poor. Even worse, his parents both died when he was still very young as there was no money to pay for needed medication. Pa Nfoh joined GHAPE in 2005, facing the need to bring up a good family on his own. Since then, he has borrowed and successfully repaid three loans and the profits from these loans has helped him to sustain his life and that of his family, as well as to cater for the school needs of his youngest child.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan he plans to buy piglets, pig feed, wood, and chickens to resell in his home so as to reduce the distance that his neighbors must trek in order to obtain these items. He will use the profit generated by this business to continue to educate his children and part will be ploughed back into his business. He thinks his business will succeed because he has been doing this business for a long period of time. He is going to start repayments the fourth month after the loan has been disbursed.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE)<\/b> is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

In this same year, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000FRS, and her repayment was done promptly. She plans to invest her second loan in making of traditional dresses and buying and selling of foodstuffs. More specifically she will buy corn, beans and cocoyams.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long period of time, she has a good site for this particular business and she is having a lot of customers. Her neighbors are happy she is doing business near them because their distance to the market is reduced and they can buy from her late in the night.\r\n<p>\r\nP. plans to use the profits to plough back into the business, cater for her children, and give good medical attention to her family.

Determined to see all his children become responsible citizens in the future, he joined GHAPE in 2005 and received his first loan of $40, which he invested in pig rearing. As of now, he has proven his credibility by receiving and repaying loans totaling $370. \n\nGiven a loan of $225, he intends to buy three piglets, one goat and construct bee hives for the production and sale of honey. Pigs and goats have highly valued in his community as a source of food. The manure he gets from the pig farm shall be used to open a vegetable garden. Honey is equally highly demanded for medicinal purposes and so he stands a great chance to benefit a lot from this investment. The profit he gets from the loan shall be used to pay school fees for his children and provide food for the family.\n\nHe intends to repay the loan in eighteen months and the first installment of repayment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of loan disbursement.  \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

J. is a member of PMPC Microfinance PDP-LP. She is a dressmaker and tailor, and also operates a NFA rice dealing business (\"bigasan ng bayan\"). She is married to Gilbert J., a van driver. They are blessed with two children, who are in day care.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is 28 years old and has been a member of the PDP-LP program for more than a year. This is her fourth cycle of loan. She is requesting an amount of PHP 10,000.00, which is intended for additional NFA capital. Her loan history shows no default and she is a member in good standing. \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to her dress tailoring and rice dealing work, she has taken on a sideline business in ice candy and ice selling.

Th\u1ecb (age 52) is a married mother of three adult children living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.  To make a living, Minh prepares and sells food in the local community, mainly seafood products such as fish and shrimp.  Minh has been in this business for more than 5 years and earns about 1.000.000 VND each month.  Minh joined the Thanh Ho\u00e1 Fund for Poor Women in 2004 to borrow funds.  She successfully repaid the 3.079.800 VND loan, which she used to expand her business and improve her living situation.\r\n\r\nAs the leader of the 7-member group 6-Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng, Minh is now requesting her 9th loan by Thanh Ho\u00e1 Fund for Poor Women so she can continue expanding her business and supplement the family's income.  Each group member will receive a 6.000.000 VND individual loan, but they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  Other group members want to expand their businesses.  L\u00fd N. Th\u1ecb (age 31), will use the funds for her food stall.  Ph\u01b0\u1eddng N. Th\u1ecb (age 45), Th\u01b0\u1eddng N. Th\u1ecb (age 35), and V\u00e2n N. Th\u1ecb (age 55), will use their loans to support their businesses raising livestock.  Thu N. Th\u1ecb (age 35) will fund her business raising crops, and B\u1eafc N. Th\u1ecb (age 45) hopes to grow her service-based business.\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Ho\u00e1 Fund for Poor Women:\r\nThe mission of the Thanh Ho\u00e1 Fund for Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Ho\u00e1 province.  Many FPW borrowers have recently expressed a desire to borrow larger amounts to make more significant investments in their businesses. In response to this, FPW has recently added a new loan product of 6.000.000 VND with a 20-month term to its Thanh Ho\u00e1 City branch portfolio."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":315801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Restaurants in Cameroon can be as small as a menu with three items and a couple of benches under an overhang. Veronica\u2019s restaurant is just that way.

She will also use the loan to pay for transportation costs associated with her business.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Veronica\u2019s second loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2007. Her first loan from GHAPE was used much in the same way, investing in her business. She has seen success from her past experiences, and knows how to alter her business practices when there is a failure, she says.\r\n<p>\r\nVeronica has struggled with living in poor conditions and not always having enough money for things like her children's school fees or house rent. With the profits from this loan, she plans to pay for food for the family and her children's school fees, as well as save money for medical fees. Veronica chooses GHAPE loans because unlike her other options, like loan sharks or private groups, she pays her loan back little by little without fear of being chased down.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

B. has been a member of ASHI (Ahon Sa hirap, Inc.) for almost two years.

The eldest daughter Leannie is 18-years-old and a college student, while the youngest, Liane Gace, is 4-years-old.\r\n\r\nWhen her parents died, Nelly was given parcel of farmland. This was the reason she and her husband began cultivating and becoming engaged in farming. Since rice is the staple food for Filipinos, the demand for its supply is getting higher. Farming supplies such as fertilizers, pesticides and seeds are expensive and Nelly finds it difficult to afford these necessities. She decided to apply for a loan in the amount of PHP 10,000 to be used to purchase fertilizers, pesticides and seeds for the farm. She is hopeful that it will be of great help for their farming needs and to raise production levels.\r\n\r\nNelly\u2019s greatest dream is to send their children to school until they have completed and for the children to find jobs so that they will not have to experience the same life that she has

But because the price of feed pumped up, she opted to shift the direction of her business. Now on her fourth loan cycle, she proposes the amount of 20,000 pesos as capital to her planned business. The amount will be spent to pay for 67 sacks of rice for retail sale. She is positive that the business will grow fast since right after the harvest, farmers automatically sell rice. With that, the in-and\u2013out of the money would be fast and it could bring them good proceeds to sustain their family needs.\r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest dream is to support the schooling needs of her grandchildren someday, since she was not able to send her children to college. And someday, will have her own space in the market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":317041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Having repaid a previous loan of 10000000 VND from TYM Fund that was used to expand the business, Mrs Th\u01b0 is now requesting a new loan of 20000000 VND to purchase additional products to sell.  This loan will be her eighth from TYM Fund, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":317357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

Ch\u00fac has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 1,000,000 Viet Nam Dong (~$56 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Ch\u00fac joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to engage in business activities.  Ch\u00fac has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND (~$209 US) from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Her previous loan was used to invest in expanding her business.  She is now requesting another loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to invest in further expanding her business.  This will be the 7th loan taken out by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Ch\u00fac plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family income.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  \u0110\u1ed7 th\u1ecb Th\u00e1i (50) is a 46 year-old female who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her business of making & selling food.\r\n\r\n2.

In response to this, FPW has recently added a new loan product of 6,000,000 VND with a 20-month term to its Thanh Hoa City branch portfolio.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nCh\u00fac D.

He is 41 years old and went to school until the 8th grade.  He is married and the father of 3 children with ages between 2 and 13 years old.  Only the two oldest are in school.\r\n\r\nAssumane moved to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, in search of work.  He worked a few years in a residence as a security guard, and he was able to open a stand in the central market of Namaacha.  As such Assumane decided to leave his job and dedicate his efforts on his business.  Today he occupies 3 spaces and has help from his nephews who live with him.  He pays them an amount of 800MT per month.\r\n\r\nWith the first loan that he received from Hluvuku and Kiva his business improved a lot.  Assumane was able to construct a stand at his house to better satisfy the needs of his neighbors and customers.  He works from 7:00am until 10:00pm.  His best products are cigarettes, lamps, glues, electric filaments, and cosmetics.  He earns 8,000MT monthly and is able to save 1,000MT.  He is ready to continue his work thus creating more leisure time for his family.  Besides his children he is also supporting his mother who lives in Nampula, and he sends her 1,000MT every 6 months.\r\n\r\nThis is Assumane's second loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The first 11,000MT were used to purchase products to resell and to build a stand at his house.  He paid it off without problems.  This loan of 20,000MT will be used to purchase products for his stand that one normally finds at home.  He is confident that he can pay off the loan before maturity so he can request another loan to complete his dream of purchasing a car, which will assist him with his daily work.\r\n<br

He is 33 years old, married, and went to school until the 7th grade.  He had to stop due to the war.  He is the father of 5 children with ages between 5 and 15 years old.

After his arrival he began working in neighboring Swaziland as a domestic servant for 2 years.  He had to quit his job because his home was kilometers from work.  After that he was able to arrange a job in the Hotel Libombos as a security guard where he has worked for over 12 years earning a monthly sum of 2,000MT.  Since his job is during the night during the day he resolved to do business selling staple products.\r\n\r\nHis best products are sodas, beer, desserts, rice, and fish.  Today he is the owner of 3 stands of which one is at home, another in the Shoprite, and one on the border.  He has 2 employees, and with his wife's help he has earned a monthly sum of 5,000MT.  He is not able to save any money because his objective is to further expand his business, and to do this it is necessary that he put all of his earnings toward stimulating his business.\r\n\r\nHe came to know Hluvuku through one of his colleagues, and he requested a loan for 8,000MT to progress his business.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva, and the 8,000MT will be used to increase the stock of his products.

He is 32 years old, married, and the father of 4 children with ages between 4 and 12 years old.  The three oldest are in school, and the youngest goes to day care.\r\n\r\nDue to poor financial conditions Jaime was only able to finish the 7th grade, and his parents were not able to pay for high school.  Years later he began crossing the Swaziland border to sell contra band products, and little by little he collected enough funds to begin a more legitimate business.  He started exchanging currencies, which was an activity that had a positive impact.\r\n\r\nWith the help of his father who lives in Chokwe, he began working in agriculture and was sent all of the supplies and agricultural instruments.  He has planted mainly tomatoes, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes.  He has 4 employees who each earn 1,000MT per month, and by investing a maximum of 30,000MT he receives an income of 20,000MT.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of a market he has to rent a car to transport his products from Chokwe to Zimpeto, and he pays 3,000MT each trip.  Jaime is not able to save any money because besides his children he is also responsible for his mother who lives in his house he is constructing.\r\n\r\nThis is Jaime's third loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The first two were used to purchase construction materials, and this loan of 15,000MT will be used for the same reason.

They all live in the Djaka Kin district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali), and they know one another through ties of community, marriage, and social groups (mutual aid for societal events: marriage, baptisms, and funerals).  The group members have exclusively been buying and selling fish in all forms (fresh, fried, smoked, and dried) since they were young. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase the volume of their income-earning business, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program and are on their fourth solidarity loan, after having repaid the preceding ones without a problem.  They intend to buy 88 baskets of fish, equal to 1.32 tonnes, from fishermen in Markala, and in Macina or in Teninkou in times of crisis.   A portion of the fish is sold fresh door-to-door in the administrative district (service Kin) of the Kirango area, and the other portion is first dried in a corner of the house using a traditional dryer designed for this purpose.  The fish thus obtained is resold retail, cash or credit accepted, in S\u00e9gou, at the fairs of Bousssin and Siribala, to customers composed of men and women.\r\n\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average monthly profit of 53,000 francs CFA that will be put into savings and used to cover the medical costs for the children.   Their ambition is to raise animals (cattle) in order to build a house, little by little, in which to live.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":317605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaratou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bafana                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baminata                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaaya                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bamass\u00e9                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan             Foun\u00e8     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":558.33,"local_amount":266666.66,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":268652.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020257,"comment":null},{"amount":279.18,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":134326,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243012,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":134326.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678814,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":134326.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112622,"comment":null},{"amount":279.15,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":134326.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028189,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-03T14:19:31Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":107545,"name":"Kossi Mawuli","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce monsieur est un r\u00e9sident du quartier de b\u00e8-klikam\u00e8  qui est un quartier p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique de la ville de Lom\u00e9, il est c\u00e9libataire et pour pouvoir subvenir convenablement \u00e0 ses besoins il a commenc\u00e9 l\u2019ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re le commerce de friperie.

He is married and the father of four children, ages 8, 7, 5 and one month. In addition to supporting his family, he is responsible for supporting one nephew, who lives with them. Domingos's studies were interrupted in 10th grade, due to his family's financial constraints.\r\n\r\nDomingos' general store, a business he's had for the past 10 years, brings him 1000,00 mt per day. This is his 6th loan with Hluvuku, and he plans to invest it in increasing his stock--as he has done with all previous loans. With the help of credit, Domingos hopes to be able to open a new store, in the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

He is married but does not have children yet.  He lives with his parents.  After finishing school Horinchon right away became a small entrepreneur.  He started by purchasing and selling dried fruits at the local markets.  Gradually after earning his own capital he started purchasing dried fruits in wholesale quantities and sorting them at home.  This allowed him to earn big profits, because sorting by grade improves the quality of dried fruits.  \r\n\r\nGradually he also started to purchase and sell animal feed.  He purchased a small truck for this on which he travels to neighboring Kirgizstan for feed.  By this point his turnover has grown and allows him to support not only his own family but also his parent\u2019s family.  Horinchon has been working with MicroInvest for over a year.  He plans to grow his business further and this is why he decided to put in a new application for a loan.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":317810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Grow business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T19:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Horinchon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":923.71},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":952.96},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":983.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1014.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1046.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1079.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.93},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.24},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.57},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":230.93,"local_amount":923.71,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":935.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44600133,"comment":null},{"amount":238.24,"local_amount":952.96,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":965.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994566,"comment":null},{"amount":245.78,"local_amount":983.14,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":995.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215811,"comment":null},{"amount":253.57,"local_amount":1014.27,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645298,"comment":null},{"amount":261.6,"local_amount":1046.39,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084898,"comment":null},{"amount":269.88,"local_amount":1079.53,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1093.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001102,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T01:38:38Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:31:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":107611,"name":"Marcelino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Marcelino Padr\u00f3n vive con su esposa la se\u00f1ora Nicolasa Gamez, ellos son padres de dos hijos peque\u00f1os los cuales son el motivo de esta pareja para salir adelante. \nEl labora para una empresa de ediciones y publicaciones desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, a parte cuenta con otro ingreso ya que tiene su propio taller de soldadura y herrer\u00eda desde hace 8 a\u00f1os. \nEl esta solicitando este cr\u00e9dito para la inversi\u00f3n en la compra de materia prima para seguir produciendo su trabajo. \n\n\n","en":"Marcelino Padr\u00f3n lives with his wife, Nicolasa Gamez.

is 32 years old; he is married and has 3 children.  He works at a factory that makes construction materials.  The job is permanent and Bahodur is busy at it for almost the entire week.  He receives his salary on time.  But the family is growing and in order to cover growing needs Bahodur opened a small store in his home to sell food products.  His wife and mother work as sellers.  Bahodur brings products in once a week from the wholesale market and during the week from local wholesalers.  Bahodur plans to get a wholesale quantity of products and needs additional financing.  Also he plans to purchase a freezer to sell ice cream and this is why he applied for a loan on KIVA.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":317813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase food and a freezer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T19:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahodur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7500,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":838.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":865},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":892.39},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":920.65},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":949.81},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":979.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1042.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.1},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.16},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.97},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":209.61,"local_amount":838.45,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":849.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44600134,"comment":null},{"amount":216.25,"local_amount":865,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":876.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994567,"comment":null},{"amount":223.1,"local_amount":892.39,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":903.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215812,"comment":null},{"amount":230.16,"local_amount":920.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":932.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645299,"comment":null},{"amount":237.45,"local_amount":949.81,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":962.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084899,"comment":null},{"amount":244.97,"local_amount":979.88,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":992.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001103,"comment":null},{"amount":252.73,"local_amount":1010.91,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846301,"comment":null},{"amount":260.73,"local_amount":1042.91,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1056.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737370,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-29T20:12:57Z","paid_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":107613,"name":"Ith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ith A., 39, is pictured here with her husband.

She is now requesting a new loan of 1,500,000 IDR which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. The loan will be her fourth from DINARI.
