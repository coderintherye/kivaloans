Most of the women grow and sell garden plants. They are long-time residents of the neighborhood and all help one another in order to sell their products.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group is currently in its 8th loan cycle with Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguay's Mujeres Emprendedoras group loan program. Each group member will receive an average of 486,000 guaran\u00eds apiece (US $121.80).\r\n<p>\r\nThe group was founded thanks to the efforts of the current president, Salvadora M., who contacted Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya's head of group loans, Freddy Bord\u00f3n, who told her what the requirements were for forming groups. Soon, they were able to get 15 women interested in forming a group together to meet. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Salvadora says that the group of women are carrying out a project that is having very positive results: they are selling their products at Km 52 of Route 2. Sales are especially good on weekends, when religious pilgrims visit the city to honor the Virgin of Caacup\u00e9. The group's early results have been very promising, since they have made a good number of sales. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the loans they received from Fudaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, the group members mostly bought great quantities of seeds, plants, fertilizers and pots (9 of the 15 women own plant nurseries; the others sell drinks, work as street vendors or own neighborhood stores).  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":195873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy fertilizers, seeds, garden plants, pots ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caacupe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.383333 -57.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:03:50Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asenci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vidalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T17:38:21Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":7300000,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2433333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2433333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2433333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":608.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":608.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":608.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":608.33,"local_amount":2433333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:18:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2442610.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5318518,"comment":null},{"amount":608.33,"local_amount":2433333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2442610.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9937035,"comment":null},{"amount":608.34,"local_amount":2433333.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T09:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2442610.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860609,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-01T17:38:21Z","paid_date":"2009-02-21T09:11:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":62747,"name":"Eus\u00e9bio Gilbe","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Eus\u00e9bio Gilberto M.  \u00e9 natural de manjacaze prov\u00edncia de Gaza ao sul de Mo\u00e7ambique tem 59 anos idade, casado e pai de 6 filhos, com idades entre 34, 28, 26, 22, 20 e 18 anos respectivamente e todos s\u00e3o estudantes.

He is married and the father of three children: a girl of 13, a boy of 11, and a baby of 3 months.  The two eldest already go to school.  Salom\u00e3o and his family moved to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland, to look for employment.\r\n\r\nSalom\u00e3o studied until fourth grade.  He didn't continue his studies due to the poor financial situation.  After stopping his studies, he fled to neighboring South Africa during the war, where he worked several years as a stonemason and painter.  At the end of the war, he returned and settled in Namaacha, working on a poultry-raising project.  He also constructed his home and a small commercial establishment in his yard to increase his family's income.  Years later his boss's business failed, and Salom\u00e3o now supports his family with his business, selling staple items.  His best product is sugar, which he buys at 18 meticais per kilo and sells for 22.  He counts on the help of his wife, and they work from 6:30 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening, earning a monthly income of 6000 meticais.  However, he doesn't manage to save anything, as besides his family, also Salom\u00e3o helps his mother, who lives in another district, sending her 500 meticais monthly.\r\n\r\nThis is Salom\u00e3o's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva, in the amount of 7000 meticais, and will be used to increase the amount of stock.  In this manner, he believes that he will manage to satisfy the needs of his customers, considering that they are located a bit distant from the market.  In the future, he plans to request more loans--to construct a wall around his home, and to construct a coop for raising chickens.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

He went to school until the fifth grade and fulfilled his compulsory military service.  He is divorced and the father of six children between the ages of 27 and 11 years.  The three eldest are already employed and supporting the three younger, who are still in school.\r\n\r\nAfter completing his compulsory military service, Inacio was transfered to Maputo, where he worked in the PRM (Police of the Republic of Mozambique), and in the following year married his wife.  In 1987 he was transfered to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland.  As he was already in conflict with his wife at that time, Inacio divorced her, leaving her with the house and children, and came to live alone in Namaacha in a house provided by the State.  He got a permanent position as a residence officer at 29 years old.  He works 24 hours a day, three days a week, earning a monthly salary of 5853 meticais, and has a military pension of 4558 meticais.  He supports his three children, sending them a monthly allowance of 1000 apiece, and every three months he sends 3000 meticais to his mother in Cabo Delgado.  He doesn't manage to save anything by the end of the month because he is building his house there in the village.\r\n\r\nThis is Inacio's third loan, his second through Hluvuku, and his first with Kiva.  His first loan was with the BIM (International Bank of Mozambique), to launch his construction work.  It was for 40000 meticais, and he repaid it in three years.  In 2007, he became acquainted with Hluvuku through a friend and requested a first loan in the amount of 12000 meticais, which he used to buy construction material to continue the construction project.  He was able to repay that loan ahead of time.  He requests this second loan to finish the construction.  Once he repays this loan, he plans to request another, for furnishing his home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

Only the oldest attends school.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, Assumane moved to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland, to look for work.  He worked for a few years as a guard in a residence and was able to open a booth in the central market of Namaacha. Thus, Assumane decided to leave his job and dedicate himself to his business.  Today he has three booths and sells basic products with the help of his two nephews who live with him.  He gives his nephews a monthly allowance of 500 MT. They work from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. selling the best products (including lamps, electric wire, and adhesives). They earn 6,000 MT per month.  He has not been able to save, but he already owns his own home, and has built on his land a small commercial establishment that will function as a grocery store, tended by his wife.  Besides his family, Assumane supports his mother, who lives in Nampula, sending her 1,000 MT every six months.\r\n\r\nThis is Assumane\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva.  The loan is for 11,000 MT and will be used to purchase products for his booths.  He is confident that he will be able to repay the loan before the due date.  He intends to request another loan to buy a vehicle to help with his purchases, because he spends a lot of money on transportation.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Steve Fogel, Kiva

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My journey to see the group called \"Marquencitas\" was not the usual route one would take to go to work every day! I had to take a boat from Panajachel\u00b4s docks to San Juan de la Laguna. \r\n\r\nThe members of the Marquencitas trust bank, natives of San Marcos la Laguna, hopped also into a public \"lancha\" (boat) and went to the town of San Juan. These women have to travel to San Juan because there is no commercial bank in San Marcos la Laguna.\r\n\r\nUpon my arrival, I was picked up by the loan officer and\u2026 all the women! \r\n\r\nThe entire group was there to welcome me and, as though we were in a procession, we strolled through the streets of the pretty town of San Juan, and they took me to the repayment meeting site.\r\n\r\nMost of the women work in embroidery and some sew traditional skirts and blouses. Two of them have a convenience store and two others raise animals. Odilia, the president of the group, has a convenience store and, while selling in her store, she does also bead work on the side. There is a feeling in the group that the repayment meetings are a moment of fun and it helps these women to have a bit of fun in their lives.\r\n\r\nThe women tell me they like San Marcos because it is clean, because all the garbage is collected by the municipality's truck. It makes them happy that the village is treated so well. Florinda tells me it must be because of the influence of the foreigners who have their businesses in San Marcos. \r\n\r\nHowever, the arrival of foreigners isn't making all the women of the group happy. San Marcos is the Mecca of this region where western spiritual business boomed after the seventies. There are many places where massages, meditation, and other spirituality are practiced. This is good for the local economy but, unfortunately, most of the money is made by the foreigners and the native inhabitants of San Marcos make very little money themselves.  \r\n\r\nDuring the rainy season, the women make only enough money to cover their repayments. This way they just make it until summer time arrives. They all expect business will improve and they will be able to make some money in different ways as soon as the rainy season ends.\r\n\r\nI cant help but think how unbalanced their situation must feel; not being able to make the money that they need to keep their daily lives going when, next to them, others make money in ways they don't control.

The prinicipal economic activities of the people in the region are agriculture, livestock raising and commerce.<p>Filomena C. R., a single mother of a 3 year old boy, is requesting a loan of 400 soles (Peruvian currency). Her business is vegetable sales. Starting as a child she worked selling vegetables in order to support her younger sisters. Her goal is to sell vegetables in every fair. To meet this goal she needs capital, but previously no one would loan to her because she did not meet the approval requirements. When she was ill for a time, her business suffered and she had to borrow money from her neighbor at 10% interest. Finally she saw that a FINCA representative was giving out loans accompanied by business training. Says Filomena, \"From that moment FINCA trusted me, lending me the capital to grow my business. I bought embroidery  thread and now I am embroidering the petticoats local women wear under the skirts of our traditional dress; it is going very well.\"  One of Filomena's obstacles has been a year-long bout of gastritis, which severly impacted her business, but she had the support of her family and FINCA. With the loan, she is going to buy cloth with which to make aprons, since she has a small sewing machine. Through local bartering, she trades the aprons that she makes for corn and barley. She dreams of one day opening a clothing store with her own savings, and sellling wholesale. Some day she would also like to get to know the capital city of Lima, arriving there as a business woman. <p>Patricia R. R. is married with 8 children ranging in age from 12 to 22. All of her children are in school; the eldest attends the national university. She is requesting a  loan of 800 Peruvian soles. Her business is the sale of lambs; Patricia raises sheep. Before she was born her father passed away. As a result, the people of the village marginalized her. A friend took her to Lima where she got married and started a business with her husband. Unfortunately, the couple lost  everything in a robbery and had to return to her village with nothing. That's when Patricia began to raise her sheep. \"When FINCA arrived in the village the community did not support me in my application for a loan because they did not believe I would be able to repay it, but I stood my ground. In the end, FINCA loaned me the money and gave me the business training. I was able to reopen my business selling meat and free range eggs. Now that I qualify for a larger loan I would like to begin selling my meat in Lima. Thanks to FINCA and their training courses, I feel valued, and the people no longer marginalize me since I now have a stable business.\"  The loan will be invested in rams, more eggs, and cheese. Her dream is to have a butcher stand in the city of Huancavelica, and to support her son in the university, in the hope that he will later be able to support his younger siblings, so that they, too, may go on to be professionals.<p>Maria C. R., single mother of a 4 year old son, is taking out  a loan of 800 Peruvian soles. She sells potatoes, and has now started a business making embroidered petticoats. \"In the beginning I did not want to walk into the training meetings; I didn't say a word in them. Now I am very talkative.\" Maria is the local president of the Glass of Milk program, a national social program providing basic and much-needed nutrition to the poor. Her leadership of that program demonstrates that she knows how to value herself as a woman. Now, she says,  people say that she is an entrepreneur, thanks to God, because FINCA trusted her. Maria overcame a difficult obstacle in life: the father of her son left her, leaving her with only the support of an aunt. With the loan from FINCA she will buy an embroidery frame and perhaps hire an assistant. She dreams of owning her own embroidery business, which she will call \"El Resplandor\" ( perhaps  \"The Glow\" or \"The Gleam\" in English). <p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n<p>El Bancomunal  Ccatarisun Llaqta perteneciente al Distrito D.

All of the members are married and have different business activities. For example, Mrs. S., who breeds cows and pigs, lacks sufficient money to buy cow and pig food. Thus, she is requesting a loan for this purpose. Her husband, Mr. Sao Thon, is a farmer who earns additional income by watering villagers\u2019 rice fields.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thea S. is 58 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are employed as security guards earning $37 each per month. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

All the members are married and have various uses for the loan which they will obtain. For instance, Mrs. Saom S., the Village Bank President, is requesting a loan to hire a labourer with oxen to plow her rice field. Her husband, Mr. Sok Sorphorn, owns a small grocery store in the local village and also helps his wife on the land. \r\n\r\nMrs. Saom S. is 35 years old and the mother of two children who both attend school. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. All the members have end-of-term loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":196992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire a labourer with oxen to plow her rice field ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-09-03T13:50:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ku","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Long","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-17T14:25:19Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":516493.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5285788,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":103298.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14823030,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":51649.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20359461,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":51649.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27048511,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T11:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":361545.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35940185,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":123958.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44397771,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-23T07:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":413195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52905589,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-24T08:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":289236.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63127676,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-17T08:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":568143.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73551144,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-03T14:25:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-17T08:01:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":62928,"name":"Sreymom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sreymom E. is 40-year-old grocery seller in her village while her husband, Pen Sokun, is a 51-year-old policeman.

is the Village Bank President. All of the members plan to use the loan for a variety of purposes. For instance, Mrs. Bu H. is a cow and pig breeder, and as the animals grow bigger, she lacks sufficient money to buy food for them; she therefore is requesting a loan to buy grass and pig food for her animals. Aside from this business, she is a farmer who cultivates rice and vegetables while her husband, Mr. Mich H., assists her in order to improve their living conditions together. \r\n\r\nMrs. Bu H. is 50 years old and the mother of seven children, one of whom is a farmer while another two are employed in a garment factoR.. Another is an electrician while the remaining three are attending high school. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the veR. end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.

Elmer F. lives in the Lourdes districtt in the province of La Libertad along with his wife.  At 60 years of age, Elmer needs to work two jobs to maintain his household.  In addition to doing traditional agricultural work, he also works in transportation, making trips for his local church.  His wife helps also, having a sewing business which she manages from their house.  Their many fixed expenses have obliged them to postpone necessary repairs and improvements for their house.  One of these improvements is the roof above the hallway in the house, which has been impossible for them to repair due to them having to prioritize their expenses in order to survive.  That's why he is requesting a loan to install a new roof over the hallway of the house since the current one has significant damage.   <P>\r\nIt should be mentioned that this will be the first loan for Elmer with Integral, although he has already had several loans from various cooperatives that he has repaid with promptness and responsibility. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl Sr. Elmer F.,  vive en el cant\u00f3n Lourdes jurisdicci\u00f3n del Departamento de La Libertad,  junto a su esposa.

For the past five years, Robiya has been engaged in many income-generating activities, particularly, a children's toy sales business, and has been able to pay for her children's food and studies with the business profits. Before starting the sales business, Robiya was running a store at her house. This allowed her to take care of her children, while they assisted her with the clients. Robiya started her children's toy sales business with US $600 from her savings, with additional financial help from her older children.

Nevertheless, they need this loan to purchase beef that Mr. Antonio is going to bring from the city of Caazap\u00e1.  \r\n\r\n<p>  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the daily purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables, he has to pay a tax to the municipality for the use of the space for the cafeteria.  They are happy with this business that allows them to be closer to their children, who work alongside them.  This will be their first loan with the Foundation.<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":197270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of meat, rice, sugar, oil, milk, sweets, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ciudad del Este","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.516667 -54.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:04:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-16T23:36:39Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5318580,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9937097,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T09:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860669,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20401967,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094048,"comment":null},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35987571,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44568786,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959147,"comment":null},{"amount":52.51,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T09:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176399,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":209695.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602072,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-02T23:36:39Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T15:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":63024,"name":"Virginia F\u00e1tima","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Mrs. Virginia F\u00e1tima M.

Setiap hari Siti Murtafiah giat menjalankan usahanya membuat kue. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 500.000.- ia memulai usaha ini. Awalnya Siti Murtafiah hanya membuat kue donat dan roti kukus saja, kue tersebut dititipkan pada warung-warung terdekat. Dengan modal sedikit tentu saja keuntungan yang diperoleh sedikit dan itu hanya cukup untuk keperluan dapur saja. Siti Murtafiah mempunyai 3 orang anak yang perlu biaya untuk pendidikannya, sedangkan suaminya hanyalah seorang pedagang sayuran keliling yang kini penghasilannya sangat kecil karena situasinya sangat sepi. Untungnya ada Yayasan Dinari yang memberi tambahan pinjaman modal. Modal ini dipergunakan untuk membeli bahan-bahan seperti tepung, gula, telor dan keperluan pembuatan kue lainya sehingga Siti Murtafiah dapat tetap menjalankan usahanya. Bahkan kini Siti Murtafiah dapat melayani lebih banyak pelanggan, juga suaminya yang kebetulan juga berjualan keliling sehingga bisa menjual kue buatan Siti. Sekarang kue yang dibuat Siti Murtafiah bukan hanya satu jenis saja, tetapi bisa berbagai jenis dan juga melayani pesanan sesuai permintaan pelanggan sehingga keuntungan yang didapat menjadi lebih banyak. Dari keuntungan itu Siti Murtafiah dapat menyekolahkan anaknya dan juga memenuhi kebutuhan setiap hari,dan apabila ada sisa barulah kemudian ditabung","en":"Siti Murtafiah is a diligent house wife. She has a cookies making business. She started this business with IDR 500 thousand (around USD 60). At the beginning, she only made donut and cup cakes. She put these cookies in the nearby food stalls. She only made small margin of profit from this business as she did not have enough capital. <p>\r\nShe has 3 children who are in school. Her husband sells vegetables in the market. Dinari foundation gave her loan to add her working capital so she can buy more ingredients such as flour, eggs, sugars etc. She makes more than 2 kind of cookies now and her business is growing.

mempunyai usaha sebagai Pedagang es batu  yang sudah ditekuni selama 3 tahun. Suaminya  sebagai seorang sopir. Kasiati harus berusaha agar bisa membantu pendapatan rumah tangga ,mengingat 4 orang anaknya membutuhkan biaya untuk sekolah. Dengan modal awal sebesar 2 juta rupiah Kasiati membeli sebuah lemari es untuk membuat es batu. Namun satu buah lemari es tidak bisa memenuhi kebutuhan pelanggan yang kini mulai meningkat. Langganan pembelinya adalah warung yang menjual minuman ringan dan pedagang ikan supaya ikannya tidak membusuk. Dengan satu lemari es tentu saja keuntungan yang didapat juga sedikit, karena satu bungkus es dalam plastik usuran 1 kilogram dijual seharga Rp.700. Keuntungan ini dipakai cukup untuk keperluan dapur saja. Karena kebutuhan akan es batu terus meningkat maka Kasiati mengajukan pinjaman modal ke Yayasan Dinari. Modal ini dipergunakan untuk menambah lemari es, sehingga kini Kasiati sudah memiliki 3 lemari es. Dengan tambahan peralatan tersebut diharapkan penghasilan serta keuntungan yang didapat akan meningkat sehingga Kasiati bisa melanjutkan sekolah anak-anaknya ketingkat yang lebih tinggi lagi,dan Kasiati sangat berterimakasi kepada Yayasan Dinari karena sudah membantu dalam permodalan.","en":"Kasiati sells ice cube\/ ice block. She has been in this business for 3 years. Her husband is a driver. She has this business to help the family's economic condition as they have 4 school age children. <p>\r\nWith the start up capital of IDR 2 million (around USD 220), she bought a refrigerator to make ice cubes. Her customers are nearby soda or soft drinks vendors and also the fish sellers. She sells 1 kg of ice cube for IDR 700 (around 10 US Cent). <p>\r\nHowever one refrigerator is not enough now as her customers are growing. Therefore she applied loan to Dinari foundation to enable her to buy more refrigerator. She now has 3 refrigerators. She hopes that this can help her expanding her business. She hopes she can send her children to higher level of education.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva

After years of sacrifice, Jos\u00e9 graduated with his degree in nursing which constituted the first step in reaching his vocational goal.  Jos\u00e9 Fredy has maintained his salon with much perseverance and effort, and he is now studying medicine at the University of El Salvador.  To make his dream \u2013 and vocation \u2013 a reality, Fredy is soliciting a loan to invest into his business.  He would like to purchase a shampoo station table and various supplies (such as hair dyes, combs, gels, etc.).  These items will help his business and, in turn, mitigate the high cost of his chosen profession so he can get one step closer to the white doctor\u2019s coat he so yearns for. \r\n\r\n Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Fredy G. vive en Lourdes Colon, en el departamento de La Libertad, desde hace ya varios a\u00f1os, su sue\u00f1o ha sido convertirse en medico, sue\u00f1o que ha perseguido desde muy joven.  Para alcanzarlo, Jos\u00e9 Fredy abri\u00f3 hace 18 a\u00f1os un negocio de estilismo profesional en cabello, como veh\u00edculo que le generase  ingresos, y que  le ha servido para costear sus estudios, adem\u00e1s de cubrir sus gastos de vida.\r\nTras a\u00f1os de sacrificio, Jos\u00e9 se gradu\u00f3 como Lic.

Acompa\u00f1ado de perseverancia y esfuerzo, Jos\u00e9 Fredy ha mantenido su negocio de estilismo y estudia ahora Medicina en la Universidad de El Salvador. Para completar su sue\u00f1o y vocaci\u00f3n, Fredy solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para re-invertir en su negocio, comprando un mueble de lavado de pelo, e insumos (tintes, peines, gelatinas, etc), que le
