She has a business selling bed sheets, curtains, comforters and awnings.  She has been in this line of work for 2 years.  She travels through the neighborhood selling door-to-door.  She allows her customers to buy her merchandise on credit with easy terms.  She often travels to the city of Portoviejo where she acquires from the wholesalers the merchandise ordered by her customers.  In addition, she has a woman who works for her and helps her to sell in another area of the region.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan she will invest in merchandise, especially for the beach season.  She will buy swim shorts and bathing suits for women, men and children, and other articles for the beach.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house, because now she lives in a very small rented space, which her mother has given her to share with her small children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":495533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy swim shorts, bathing suits, and other items for the beach season   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-27T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jakeline Katiuska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946481,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946482,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946483,"comment":null},{"amount":113.48,"local_amount":112.75,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":113.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674748,"comment":null},{"amount":196.52,"local_amount":195.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":196.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708912,"comment":null},{"amount":155,"local_amount":154,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892207,"comment":null},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632615,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T00:16:00Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181451,"name":"Mila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mila C. is from the village of Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province.

She lives on the outskirts of Cuenca in the parish of Cumbe. She is 40 years old and has been divorced for three years. Her marriage was broken up by another woman. With her husband she had three children who are now 17, 16 and 5 years old. Her older sons work in construction when there is work to be found. They contribute what little they earn to the household and to their younger sister\u2019s education. The house they live in is theirs, as it was the inheritance left to the children by their father.\r\n\r\nMaria works selling vegetables at the Feria Libre, a large market in Cuenca. She has been in this line of work since she was 12, as she used to help her mother with sales on Mondays, Saturdays and Sundays from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. She keeps the same work hours today. Maria has been working with this little bank for two years and she tells us that it has helped her to increase the number of vegetables and fruits at her stand and offer her customers a variety of products. With the loan offered to her by FUNDACION ESPOIR [a Kiva Field Partner] she will buy tomatoes, onions, peas, carrots and other vegetables to stock her business.\r\n\r\nHer great dream is to get ahead along with her children and to give them a better future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":497489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, peas, carrots and some fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-28T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946488,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946489,"comment":null},{"amount":258.35,"local_amount":256.68,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":258.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708915,"comment":null},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892210,"comment":null},{"amount":129.13,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":129.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632618,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T02:59:21Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181459,"name":"Medelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Medelyn V. is from the village of Talakag Bukidnon.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Jenamae has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jenamae joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jenamae has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Jenamae is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jenamae from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

V. T. is a 35-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa.  H. is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is 015 Quang Hung.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. is married and has two school-aged children.  To making a living, H. owns and operates a business venture in the manufacturing sector operating a furniture making business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling cabinets and wardrobe furniture to local businesses and community members.  H. has been engaged in this business for more than eight years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings.  The loan will be her fourth loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the other group members:\r\n\r\n1.  Nguyen T.

Along the slopes and at the base of the mountains are some of the most glorious pastures.  That\u2019s why Kyrgyzstan has long been known for its cattle ranching.  Even now, in the twenty-first century, the cattle business is an essential part of the country\u2019s economy, with most of the population living in rural areas and working primarily in farming and cattle-raising.  The subject of our story is also directly involved with this time-honored profession of the Kyrgyzstan people. \r\n\r\nKaramatkhan T. is the head of her group.  She and her family live in the city of Kara-Balta.  She is thirty-one and has two pre-school-aged children, so for the time being she is not working and stays at home while her husband provides for the family.  For many years, Karamatkhan and her husband saved up their money and bought cattle for resale.  Over the past four years, cattle resale has become her family\u2019s primary livelihood.  The return on the resale comes to around eight-thousand som ($180) per month.  And considering the fact that they are just starting out and have invested eighteen-thousand som ($450) in their business, their current income is quite impressive.  Karamatkhan currently needs a loan so she can purchase cattle for resale.  In the near future, they plan to buy a car and build a house.\r\n\r\nShe has three partners in her group:\r\n\r\nTadjinisa T. is thirty-three and has two sons.  Her eldest is already in school.  Her husband sells vegetable containers at the market.  Tadjinisa helps her husband as much as she can while still raising the children.  She requested the loan to buy vegetables for resale.  \r\n\r\nIyris T. is forty-three and the mother of eight children.  Her eldest daughter is married.  One of her sons works in Bishkek and the younger children are in school.  Iyris and her husband breed livestock and sell milk.  They requested the loan because they\u2019re in need of capital to buy sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\nJyldyz R. is forty-four and her husband works in Russia.  She has four children; the eldest works in a sewing shop and the younger ones are in school.  She raises cattle and sells milk.  She hopes to receive a loan to buy beef for resale.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It is human nature to seek fault with someone else, and usually people find someone or something to blame: their boss, the government, life in general, anything but themselves. Nevertheless, there are people who, instead of assigning blame, do their best in order to change their lives for the better. All members of the group being presented is middle-class. No one has any special financial advantage. The leader of the group is Damira B.. She is 32 years old. She is married and lives with her family in the town of Karabalta. In order to help her husband meet the family expenses, three years ago she started a business retailing various everyday goods (foodstuffs, matches, salt, sugar etc). Before launching this business, she discussed it with her sister, and they invested their savings jointly. Now, three years later, Damira has a monthly income of 8,000 somos ($180). Moreover, her business made it possible for her to buy a car. Now Damira needs a loan. She needs it in order to buy a new stock of goods for the upcoming season of spring holidays.

He needs to purchase work supplies.\r\n\r\nJyldyz B.-K. is 27 years old. Jyldyz\u2019 husband works in a private company. Jyldyaz has two children. The children are still young, and so it mostly falls to the husband to provide for the family. He also resells sheep on the side. Jyldyz is hoping to obtain a loan in order to buy sheep for resale. \r\n\r\nBekjan S. is 23 years old. He is single, and his business is passenger transport.

Sometimes a person is very well dressed, but turns out that he is not rich.  And sometimes it is the opposite: a person walks by wearing fairly old, worn clothing, but turns out that this is his work uniform, and he is an owner of some type of company.   However it may be, the heroes of our story are ordinary people, those who surround us every day on the street.  But people in this category differ from the gray masses in one aspect, which is the strong will and drive to change their lives for the better.  And their will is expressed in concrete ideas and responsibility.  Take, for example, Duyunbubu D..  She lives in the city of Tokmak together with her daughter, who currently sells souvenirs in the United Arab Emirates.  Duyunbubu is divorced, and at fifty-six years old, in order to support herself and her daughter, she sews traditional goods, also called \u201ctoshoki\u201d (patchwork quilts) in the Kyrgyz language.  When Duyunbubu lost her job, she quickly realized that the time has come to find work for herself and started sewing toshoki for sale.  Now this business yields her around four thousand som ($100) per month.  Duyunbubu requested this loan in order to purchase fabric for sewing in anticipation of the holidays. \r\n\r\nDuyunbubu has three partners in this group:\r\n\r\nZina S. is fifty years old.  She is a widow and has four children.  The children are already grown and provide for themselves.  However, Zina is in no way dependent on her children and has her own business.  She sells robes.  The sale of robes yields Zina around ten thousand som per month.  Zina needs a loan in order to purchase a container.\r\n\r\nJyldyzkan J. is forty-four years old.  Her husband is a construction worker.  Jyldyzkan sells traditional goods, such as toshoki, pillows and rugs.  She also has one son, who works as a mechanic at the technical service station.  Jyldyzkan currently needs a loan.  She wants to purchase materials of various colors in order to make rugs.\r\n\r\nNurgul A. is thirty years old.  Together with her husband, Nurgul is raising one daughter, who is five years old.  Nurgul\u2019s husband works at the Umrut and Ka milk processing factory, and Nurgul is involved in selling scarves.

These are the people, who do not complain about vicissitudes and simply try to use all of the possible opportunities in order to achieve their goals.  In the current times, when there is unemployment everywhere, the heroes of our story are precisely characterized as people in this resilient category.  Zinaida K. is the leader of this group.  Zinaida, her husband and their two sons live in the town of Tokmak.  It is a small town that was famous for its industrial potential during the Soviet years.  But with the breakup of the Union, all of the government industrial sites stopped functioning, and many people left the town, and those who stayed became involved in sales at the market.  Zinaida is one of those who stayed.  Despite the difficult conditions in the town, she took the advice of her friend and started selling sweaters and jeans two years ago.  Her husband is involved in European-style remodeling.  The oldest son is ten years old, and the youngest is only one.  The retail business allows Zinaida to lead a more or less decent life.  She bought a television for the house along with a child\u2019s bed.  She had to invest a significant amount of money \u2013 twenty thousand som ($500) \u2013 in order to start the retail business.  But Zinaida knew that her expectations will be met and went through with it.  Currently, Zinaida needs a loan.  She wants to increase the merchandise variety for the season and requested a loan for this purpose.\r\n\r\nZinaida has three partners in this group:\r\n\r\nZarina A. is twenty-eight years old.  Her husband works at a security department.  Zaria sells various types of women\u2019s blouses and men\u2019s sweaters.  She has been involved in retail sales for three years.  She also has two small children.  Zarina needs a loan in order to purchase new types of merchandise.\r\n\r\nSerengul J. is thirty-four years old.  She helps her husband in the animal husbandry business and also makes a traditional drink, called \u201cbozo\u201d, and sells it to stores.  On the weekends, Zarina and her husband go to the livestock market in order to resell livestock.  Serengul requested the loan to purchase a bull for feeding and resale.\r\n\r\nDamira C. is forty-six years old.  She has one daughter, who attends school.  Damira and her husband plan to get involved in animal husbandry.  Up to now, Damira worked as a pediatric nurse.  She began thinking about her own business due to the low salary at that job.  So she decided to request a loan in order to buy a bull.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

It also has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's history<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has always fought to provide for her family and educate her five children, two of whom are working adults today thanks to her example. Her perseverance has given her family the assurance that she does everything possible to make their lives pleasant. \r\n<br>Due to Zebo's hard work, she was able to purchase a small plot of land that she is farming together with her husband. However, the produce from the land has decreased and family expenses are using up the little capital they have. In turn, this has reduced the amount of money available for purchasing fuels, lubricants, seeds and fertilizers for the new plot of land in which they have invested. This is why Zebo is requesting a loan of 5000 TJS. The situation which Zebo finds herself in has made her ask for help, with the hope that she will find sensitive collaborators to help her get through these hard times.   \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Gulbazor is 47 years old. She is the loving mother of three children. In order to help her husband support the large family, Gulbazor and her husband started their own business. So for the last 14 years, Gulbazor has been selling curtains. She has got her own sales point located in one of the local markets. Being a very friendly and polite person by nature, Gulbazor grew her clientele very quickly. The business is stable, generating the main income for the family. \r\n\r\nToday Gulbazor is planning to increase her working capital in order to expand her business. She needs additional funds for purchasing new styles of curtains to sell. With this purpose in mind, Gulbazor requests 8000 Somoni. Gulbazor has received loans from IMON several times and has proved herself a reliable client. She thanks all for their support and promises to be accurate in loan repayment.       \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is 38 years old and a mother of two. Her husband works at the Ministry of Works, Lagos State. She sells cooked food; until recently, she hawked cooked food from place to place but could sell only the little quantity she could carry. After she joined LAPO Microfinance, she was able to own a sales point.\r\n\r\nIyabo opens her stall every week day, from the hour of 8am to 6pm except on Sundays when she normally takes her rest.

is a married woman who supports her family through her buying and selling fish business together with her husband.   Whatever catch her husband brings back for the day, Gemma is the one who sells it in the market or even in their community. She lives in Bongalanon Basay, Negros Oriental with her husband and their 8 children, with some of them already working while the others are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of Php 15,000.\r\n\r\nGemma is now borrowing Php 20,000 so that she can expand her fish vending and for the repair of her pump boat. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of Php 12,000, which she paid off within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Gemma aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living through her pig-fattening and general store businesses.\r\n\r\nTogether with Victoria\u2019s husband, Romulo, and their 8 children (with some of them already working and having their own families while the others are still in school) they have been able to grow the business together as the children help out making it part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nVictoria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and pig-fattening businesses. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 4,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nVictoria is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 10,000 was used to fund operations for her general store and pig-fattening which had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 6th loan in the amount of Php 10,000, which she intends to use on her general store and pig-fattening. Victoria is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":495114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This school was established in 1925. Currently, the school has 17 teachers. Four of them have applied for a loan of SLL 1,000,000 for each person from SMT, a partner of Shine on Sierra Leone in Waterloo, and Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nSylvanus A. K. (top left) is the head of this group.

women from San Martin, Lim\u00f3n; a rural region located near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The women of this group are engaged in productive activities including retail sales and the rearing and selling of livestock (poultry products). \n\nThis loan will be used by the group members to further the development of their individual productive activities. Specifically, the money will be used to finance the purchase of retail products (which will be sold at a later date) such as clothing, bags, shoes, jewellery and underwear. This loan will also be used to purchase livestock (chickens) and animal feed. \n\nSan Martin is a rural region with few employment opportunities. As a result, the women of this group have taken it upon themselves to create work.  The members of this group have a desire to succeed in their businesses and to provide a better standard of living for themselves and their families. \n\nFor the women engaged in sales, a difficulty they have faced is fluctuating market prices for their products. Likewise, individuals involved in the rearing and sale of chickens have encountered obstacles such as high prices for animal feed and low market prices for poultry products.  \n\nAidali G. Aporta is the president of this group. This will be her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Aidali makes her living by selling various products from door to door in her community.

The group consists of 10 members and this is the first loan they have requested from CrediCom\u00fan.\r\n<p>\r\nF\u00e9lix Antonia R. Ch\u00e1vez is a member of the group.  She is 50 years old and has a fourth grade education.  F\u00e9lix Antonia is an embroiderer and homemaker who has four children (all sons).  She has been producing napkins, tablecloths, decorative backgrounds, and aprons for four years.  F\u00e9lix Antonia is requesting a loan to buy enough fabric and thread for making her embroideries.  Her customers are the same women in her community who order aprons and decorative backgrounds, because in this area, people are accustomed to making use of these handcrafted items.  Upon requesting her loan, F\u00e9lix Antonia was very happy that she would be able to have sufficient inventory on hand to complete her work.  She needs this loan in order to produce more embroideries.  In addition, she hopes to help her husband with tearing down their house and finish rebuilding it gradually over time.\r\n<p>\r\nBerta I. P. is another member of this group.  She is 32 years old and has a fifth grade education.  Berta is married and has three sons.  She started a business a year ago selling all kinds of products through a catalog.  The loan she is requesting will be used to buy products of different brands that she handles.  Her customers already know her because they are her neighbors and they can\u2019t wait for the days when she delivers their orders.  At the time she requested her loan, Berta felt very enthusiastic.  She wants this loan so that she can have a variety of products.  In addition, she hopes to provide her children with the education she was not able to have because she does not want them to be in the same situation.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

","en":"The \u201cLas Divinas\u201d (The Divine Ones) communal bank is represented by Marina; it is maD. up of 13 members: 11 women and 2 men.\r\n\r\nMarina is a widow and has two, school-age children, who are her reason to work.  She sells seasonal items door-to-door, in the markets and, in some cases, in offices.  She lives in a house under the anticretico modality. (Anticretico is a transaction not available in the U.S. whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from you in exchange for housing, which must be paid back to you at the end of your contract. If your loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to you).  Her greatest expectation is to grow and be able to proviD. her children with a stable home.\r\n\r\nThe other members are involved in a variety of commercial activities such as: clothing sales, vegetable and meat sales, cheese sales, cleaning supplies sales, candle-making, optician supplies, office supplies, and others.  For the most part, they all live in the same area of the city of El Alto.\r\n\r\nWithin the city\u2019s internal marketplace, any business faces a lot of competition, as is true for the rest of the country.  For this reason, the members look for other sales strategies to move their product.  For example:  they set up sales stands in as many markets as possible plus a fixed stand in the central market.  The vast majority of members earn just enough to support their families so the capital offered helps them generate working capital and a savings rate for a future; most of the members are single mothers who must fend for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to increase their working capital and business.  They will buy merchandise, materials, supplies, tools and ingredients.  The group is in its 7th loan with the institution so they have wiD. expectations for growth because they can count on support from Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapita.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

It is found in the community of San Jer\u00f3nimo Tianguismanalco in the state of Puebla. This communty is distinctive because because most of its population works in informal businesses since they don't have the possibility of working in industries or businesses. They get ahead with their work effort.  \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of 13 members and this is the first time that they have asked for a loan from CREDICOMUN.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avelina Mu\u00f1oz Lim\u00f3n was chosen to be the treasurer of the group because of her perservering character. Like a good head of household, she has been able to overcome adversities that have come up in her life.  Her business is just two years old. It's a humble little lunch diner. Her clients call her   Do\u00f1a Velita. Her main clients are the children from the nearby elementary school. She gives them cake and milkshakes at a very low price since most of them come from farm families. The loan will be used to buy a little table and some chairs to give her customers better service. \r\n\r\nThanks to this she has been able to get her financial committments and her family ahead. She has no education and that has meant that she has had to make twice the effort.  A year ago she became a widow and that same year, due to the vicissitudes of life, she lost one her children, an 18 year old who lived with her. Thanks to family support, she has been able to face this emotional and financial adversity. Her pillars of strength: 2 daughters and a son. Thanks to her participation in the communal loans, she has developed and maintained her financial activity. She does not ask for more than she can pay back.  She feels satisfied with her accomplishments because she has recovered confidence in herself. At the the time she asked for this loan, she felt enthusiastic and truly interested in this new project. She is interested in having a calm life and being able to continue for many more years with her business.   \r\n\r\nShe remarks that she wants to grow her business, adding a wider variety of products but always committing only the profits that she makes.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) generally. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the economy is dominated by the sugar cane harvest and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple, rented structure as a single mother with her three children.\r\n\r\nFeliz is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza and excited at the prospect of access to capital at low interest rates.

There is plenty of competition in the market where they work.  Nonetheless, they rapidly change and stock their merchandise.  They are always aligned with market behavior and the seasonal demands.\r\n\r\nThe loan is primarily to increase their work capital.  In the near future they want to have a fixed stand and a permanent income.  Most of the members have experience with loans because they are now in their third cycle with the institution.

It is a very joyful group that expects to grow. Ms. Pamela is married and has two children to support, which is her reason to get ahead in life. Her husband is a builder, but at this time he is temporarily unable to work. In the meantime, Ms. Pamela has to support the family with her small pastry stand, delivering her goods to schools and candy stands. She is a very positive person who will be able to help her family move forward by providing her children with a home and a good education. The other group members either sell handicrafts, baked goods, fast food, or they sew clothing for a living. There exists a lot of competition at the market where the members work, but they have an edge in the speed at which they can rotate and stock up on their goods. They always follow the market rules and meet seasonal demands. This loan will primarily be used as working capital so that they can have their own fixed stand and a steady income in the not-so-distant future. The majority of the group members have experience working with microfinance institutes as they are currently in their second loan cycle with us, so they know how to manage their capital and funds well. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

The group is comprised of 9 members who are in retail or in coca leaf sales by the take (a take is a unit of measurement used by coca sellers that is equivalent to 50 pounds). The coca leaf is highly prized in Bolivia for its medicinal benefits. They use it in tea for stomach aches, in ointments for muscle pain, and in the case of people who work in strenuous jobs like miners, they chew the leaves to combat hunger and drowsiness. <p>\r\nOur client purchases coca leaves that are brought from The Yungas, in the department of La Paz. The goods arrive at the coca market, located in the Villa Fatima zone. Before they can sell leaves, the owners must first be registered. Coca vendors must have a special permit to sell this product. <p>\r\nMs. Luz is the president of the communal bank. She has three children and sells American clothing for a living. She travels to The Yungas. With the loan, she has managed to purchase more merchandise and increase her working capital in order to improve her income. <p>\t\r\nMs. Abigail is the secretary of the group.

Some members are starting new businesses.  Others are changing out their inventory based on the season and the market conditions of supply and demand.

Tatiana works from very early in the morning buying supplies to prepare lunch and later prepares dinner for her guests. Tatiana has her own home with a small dining room where she attends to her customers. She requires a loan to expand her business and to be able to buy tables, improving her earnings in this way and giving a better quality of life to her 3 children, who are her reason for moving forward. Her husband works for a softdrink delivery company and in his spare time he helps his wife with her restaurant. The rest of the members have their own businesses, some in their homes and some in the market, including empanada and drink sales, grocery sales, and some also work as employees (but they are the promoters). In reality competention exists everywhere but as a group they always try to support each other, especially in cosmetic sales, as they sell them door to door. The loan destined for these members is so they can stock their shops and buy more products and offer better services to their customers, so that their businesses have a future with better earnings and they have an improved economic situation. As it is a new group the bank has given them the capacity to be satisfied and content to be Agrocapital clients, but some of the members already possess experience thanks to similar loans from other entities. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva

The competition amongst the members is very difficult, especially in the areas of  food sales and cosmetics, as each member hopes each day to have a good result with their sales.  This loan will be used to restock their businesses with more products, so that they can offer better service to their customers and so that their businesses will provide higher incomes in the future and a better economic situation.  As this is a new group, they have been given training, and they are very pleased and content to be clients of Agrocapital.

They all live in a settlement that is far from the municipal center in the state of Guerrero.  Each has a small business:  Jacoba is a fish and vegetable merchant.  Clarita and Alberta sell fish.  Inocencia sells fruit, Eloisa and Julia are seamstresses.  Oralia sells candy and Faustina sells chickens.  Eliz sells in a co-op and Elizabeth sells bread.  Soledad sells nutritional products and Julieta sells women\u2019s accessories.\r\n\r\nJacoba is married and has 5 children, who are 18, 17, 14, 11 and 10 years of age.  She can read and write even though she did not finish school.  She wants to buy a variety of different fruits, vegetables and fish.  Because of her children\u2019s expenses, she can\u2019t afford to stock large quantities so, what little she sells, goes quickly.  She wants to buy a variety of product so that she can sell more and earn more profits.\r\n\r\nThis is why she needs the loan:  to invest in the purchase of various fruits, vegetables and fish.  This way she will have more profits and that will help her with her children\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nTo date, she is at peace with the group since they all know each other very well.  She is happy with the loan that she will have granted because she has worked with other companies and she is seeing the big difference in interest percentage that they charge.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":497327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy vegetables and fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Cruz Grande","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-03-02T04:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inosencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eloisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oralia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julieta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":48000,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.93},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1887.5,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":24105.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952439,"comment":null},{"amount":707.81,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9039.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136681265,"comment":null},{"amount":1179.69,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":15065.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715790,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-02T23:01:14Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181788,"name":"Aurelia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nAurelia tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y tiene tres hijos de los cuales dos ya son independientes, vive junto a su hija menor en casa de su madre, ubicada en el distrito de Za\u00f1a, a 45 minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica a la crianza de animales desde hace 20 a\u00f1os. Cr\u00eda aves de corral y cerdos en la parte posterior de su vivienda, los engorda para luego comercializarlos con los negociantes que frecuentan la zona. Aurelia nos comenta que tambi\u00e9n cr\u00eda vacas con el mismo fin pero que las cr\u00eda en un terreno que posee en las afueras del distrito.

She raises barnyard fowl and pigs in her back yard.  She fattens them up and then sells to merchants that visit the area.  Aurelia tells us that she also raises cows with the same goal in mind but she raises them on property that she has on the outskirts of the district.  This activity has become her main source of income with which she supports her family and cares for her mother, who is getting on in years.\r\n\r\nAurelia would like to improve the nutrition of her animals so that they will produce higher profits at sale time.  With this in mind, she finds herself in need of calling upon Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to request a 700 new sol loan to buy nutritionally balanced animal feed.\r\n\r\nShe is a hard-working woman who has struggled to get ahead despite being a single mother.  Her neighbors and acquaintances hold her in high regard and consider her to be a trustworthy person.

SPBD's loans are Menime's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Menime K. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.7 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Thanks to the joint effort of herself and her husband she is proud to have her own home.\r\n\r\nShe sells Herbalife products.  Her working schedule is from 9am to 7pm.  She has been in this line of work for 2 years and she does well because she has steady customers.

The work consists in engraving stones to be used as decorations on facades or interiors of homes.  On the other hand, he also applies his skills to making tombstones.  This business is his family\u2019s sole source of income; he gives his best to it, therefore, in order to succeed.\r\n\r\nHis skills have made it possible for him to become more well-known in the area and his services are more in demand every day.  For this reason, he has had to call upon Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to request a 1000 new sol loan.  He plans to use the funds to buy supplies and materials (stone, chisels, stone engraving tools) with which to continue working.\r\n\r\nHugo is quite a responsible person who is dedicated to his work.

T. is 55 and married with 10 children (ages 19 - 35).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Faapale has many years of experience in this business.  Faapale needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faapale joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faapale's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faapale T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 32 and divorced with 3 children (ages 12 - 15).  She owns a business venture selling cooked foods.  Suria has 1 year of experience in this business.  Suria needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Suria joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Suria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Suria P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

M. is from the village of Labo, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 48 years old, is married, and has one school-aged and three adult children.\r\n\r\nJocelyn owns and operates a business planting and harvesting corn for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jocelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This will be her 7th loan from PMPC.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Sinavaiui has 2 years of experience in this business.  Sinavaiui needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 tala or US $108 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinavaiui joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sinavaiui's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sinavaiui S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

To make a living, Federico owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Federico has been engaged in his business for over ten years and earns approximately 7,500 PHP every four months through his business. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Federico joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Federico is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which he will use to purchase livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be Federico's ninth loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement his family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nJosephine is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector managing a direct selling business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling personal use products such as cosmetics,clothes and apparel in the local community. Josephine has been managing her business for over a year and she earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for this activity. \n\nIn 2010, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine is requesting a loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Josephine from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her dues consistently. Because of her good repayment history with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she has used the money she has borrowed to expand and improve her variety store.     \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Teresita would like to obtain a PHP 50,000 loan. This money will be a source of added capital for her expanding business, and she will use it to buy stock needed to replenish her variety store and continue its operation.  Teresita dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education. She envisions them having a good and comfortable life. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She has been managing her own variety store for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nOlivia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.

During these difficult times several people have decided to come together for each other's support with one goal to make their lives better and to create new possibilities. They are receiving a loan at MCC MBF for the third time and have shown to be outstanding borrowers and good people.\r\n\r\nLet's begin the introduction of the group members starting with the leader, as usual, who has brought everyone together.\r\n\r\nUmsun is 50 years old, she is married and is raising two children - a son and a daughter. Her son is finishing his senior year in the secondary school, and her daughter is already a first year student in college majoring in foreign languages. Her husband works as a veterinarian in the village board. She is a Kyrgyz language teacher in the local school. Besides everything her family has a cattle breeding business, a vegetable sowing business and also a retail business selling household products and other goods from their home store. The loan will be used to buy a calf for growing.\r\n \r\nMayramkan is 47 years old, she is a mother of two children. They have a very large family business which includes animal husbandry and bird breeding, as well as production of milk and milk products. They started this business in 1990. At this time they have three milk cows, one horse, 50 chickens and fifteen sheep. They plan to use this loan to buy hay stock and fodder for the livestock.\r\n\r\nFarida M. is 25 years old. She lives with her senior mother, brother and sister. Two older family members and now working in the Russian Federation. They send at least $300 every month. They are in agriculture and collect the harvest twice a year. For the first one they plan to sow potatoes and for the second one corn and sunflowers. The loan will be used to pay for the tractor services and to buy a couple of sheep for growing.\r\n\r\nLolahon is 43, she is a widow. She is raising a thirteen year old son by herself. Her dream is to give him the opportunity to get good education. She works as an accountant in the Gulbaar local board. The loan will be used to buy building materials (e.g. cement, limestone).\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":499116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy one calf, hay, fodder, building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aravan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umsun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lolahon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayramkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Farida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4422},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4632},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4853},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5149},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5272},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5580},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5806},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6153},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":6415},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6718}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.3},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.02},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100.5,"local_amount":4422,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4487.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989902,"comment":null},{"amount":105.27,"local_amount":4632,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4700.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715713,"comment":null},{"amount":110.3,"local_amount":4853,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4924.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748561,"comment":null},{"amount":117.02,"local_amount":5149,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5225.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931535,"comment":null},{"amount":119.82,"local_amount":5272,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5349.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670548,"comment":null},{"amount":126.82,"local_amount":5580,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5662.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884206,"comment":null},{"amount":131.95,"local_amount":5806,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5891.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151351,"comment":null},{"amount":139.84,"local_amount":6153,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6243.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446401,"comment":null},{"amount":145.8,"local_amount":6415,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6509.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585591,"comment":null},{"amount":152.68,"local_amount":6718,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6817.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721473,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T02:32:02Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181852,"name":"Ng\u00f4's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H\u0103\u0300ng Ng\u00f4 Thi\u0323 (20211020017) is a 28-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u0103\u0301c Ninh.

Chagnaadorj's wife operates a sewing business at their home. In 2001, Chagnaadorj started manufacturing wooden products, and his family has been very supportive of him and his business. Since Chagnaadorj started his business, the family's quality of life has improved. When the business first started, its working capital was only 50,000 tugrugs (~ 35 USD).

He has been planning to expand his business in the future. Chagnaadorj is a very hardworking person and he has great communication skills.

She sells packed cold cuts of meats and a popular brand of cured ham, and also sells condiments like soy sauce, vinegar and fish sauce.\r\n\r\nRemedios has been a regular member of Kiva field partner the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends CCT's weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.\r\n\r\nNow she has applied for a 12,000 Philippine peso loan. She plans to use this money to buy more meat and condiments to sell.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education, so that they will grow up to have stable jobs and settle down to have families of their own.

T., 45, is making sure that her family's daily needs are provided for. Married to Jeremias T., a businessman, she is blessed with two children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn their living so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her own variety store while selling cosmetics through a popular direct sales brand.\r\n\r\nSophia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow six times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her variety store and cosmetics business.     \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 14,000 loan.

C. is from Barangay Paniki, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 46 years old and is the group leader of a ten-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMercedes is widowed and has four adult children. She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mercedes joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nMercedes is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her ninth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Now she is taking out her 6th loan in the amount of Php 15,000, which she again intends to use on their fishing and fish vending business. Hilda is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

M., 57, is married to Yolemundo Mendes, a laborer\/ collector, and they are blessed with five children.  She makes sure that her family has enough provision for their daily needs and helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. Leonida is involved in direct selling of popular brand products.\r\n<br>Leonida has been a regular member of Kiva partner, Center for Community Transformation (CCT), for more than a year now. She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meeting* and pays her weekly dues consistently. As she has a good repayment record with her previous loans, she is able to borrow ten times more from CCT's Cooperative. She has been consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her business. \r\n<br>Now, with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of 19,000 PHP. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business, enabling her to make advance orders on her direct-selling lines.

V. is a 44-year-old married woman who lives in Brgy Cubay, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a ready-to-wear clothing business and managing a sugarcane farm. Nicanora\u2019s husband helps her in managing the businesses, especially with the farm. They have 5 children with ages between 14 to 27 years old - some of them are working and the others are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nNicanora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her ready-to-wear clothing business and managing their sugarcane farm. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 16,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nNicanora is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 18,000 was used to fund operations of her ready-to-wear business that has been operating for 27 years and for her sugarcane farm.  This had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 8th loan, in the amount of Php 19,500, which she intends to use for her businesses. Nicanora is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":496757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The official name of this borrowing group is Analiza O. Group.\r\n\r\nAnaliza is married and has three school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community.

She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her first from ASKI.\r\n\r\nAnaliza plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

G., 49, is making sure that her family has enough for their daily needs. Married to Edwin G., a foreman construction worker, she is  blessed with five children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn their living so that their family can have a better life.  She has been selling cooked food and managing her own variety store for several years.\r\n\r\nNenita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow six times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows as added working capital for her business. Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 6,700 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 16,000 loan.

Together they have been managing their own variety store for several years.\r\n\r\nClarisa has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow four times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to buy added stocks for her store.   Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 3,900 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan.

This amount will be used as a source of added working capital to her expanding business by buying feeds for her pigs.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will grow so that they can have a better life in the future. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":499237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buying feed for her pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2689.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128924300,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2666.66,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2689.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136652006,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2689.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144684615,"comment":null},{"amount":175.01,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8068.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152028520,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-03T18:24:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:35:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181931,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is a 31-year-old married mother of two children who attend school.
