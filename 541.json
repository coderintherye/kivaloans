is a married woman who lives in Carmen, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: vehicle repairs. Her husband William, who is 47 years old, works as a welder to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 3 and 24 years old. \r\n\r\nCherilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cherilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to buy materials for vehicle repairs  so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Cherilyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

T. is a married woman who lives in Brgy.

They have seven children who are 5 months to  10 years old. \r\n\r\nLorena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,700,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for the scrap business so that she can generate a lot of money to save up for future home repairs and her childen's education.\r\n\r\n Lorena T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rani is 45 years old and comes from Arifwala which is a small city in Punjab, Pakistan, known for its dairy industry.  She lives there in the area of Muzafarabad in a 3-room brick house with her family. She came here 24 years ago. \r\n\r\nShe is involved in selling clothing. She purchases clothes from the city of Lahore and sells to her community clients on order. She offers her clients a good variety of clothes at their doorsteps and makes good sales every month. Her husband\u2019s name is M. M. and he sells used clothes in the bazaar. A person who can\u2019t afford to buy new and costly clothes prefers shopping with him. \r\n\r\nRani is the mother of three sons and two daughters. Her daughters work in private organizations while one of her son is enrolled in a local school and getting his education. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband, who will utilize the loan money in buying used clothes in bulk.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a vegetable garden, tricycle transport and a buying and selling of flowers business. Her husband, Reynaldo, who is 45 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 7 and 15 years old. \r\n\r\nEden joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past twenty-four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eden has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $239, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 25th loan, she is borrowing 22,000 PHP, with which she intends to buy seeds for the vegetable garden so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Eden is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The official name of this borrowing group is Orlando B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nOrlando is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, he owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, planting and harvesting rice and corn for sale. He has been engaged in his business for over thirty-one years and earns approximately $117 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Orlando joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. \r\n\r\nOrlando is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be his 2nd loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The group leader is Lira Astrakhanova, and members are Zinakan O., Abdilbek S., and Bolotbek S.. They are close friends and colleagues and are united by a common goal: they each would like to get a loan from Kiva for their cattle-breeding businesses. \r\n\r\nZinakan O. is 35 and is the group treasurer. She is married with three children and her husband works in the security service of a local company. Just like her fellow group members, Zinakan breeds cattle. At this moment, she has only three head of cattle but she hopes, with help of Kiva, to increase that number. Six years ago, when she and her husband decided to start this business, Zinakan admits that she was nervous and uncertain. But she has gained valuable experience and now has her own strategy for business promotion. Her business earns her 4,000 KGS monthly, and the family has saved enough to purchase home electronics. In the future, Zinakan would like to make major repairs to her house and improve her family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   tricycle transport, sari-sari (general) store and piggery businesses. Her husband Eduardo, who is 48 years old, works as a truck driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 10 to 23 years old and currently going to school. \r\n\r\nRebecca joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, with which she intends to buy new tools and equipment for the three-wheeled vehicle so that she can continue to save up for the future and for the education of her children. Rebecca is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Every businessman aims to have a sustainable and flourishing activity that will be useful to him and to society. Introducing new food products at an affordable price is very important for a grocery store. This creditor Mairam does her best to provide good customer service and healthy products. \r\n \r\nMairam A., 37, is the treasurer of this group. She\u2019s a business lady who runs a small grocery store that she opened 4 years ago by her house. She doesn\u2019t have any employees because she can manage all services herself. She works hard to provide for her family. Three of her children go to school and the youngest is 2 years old. Mairam says it\u2019s a convenient business, because she can stay close to home and take care of her daughter. \r\n\r\nMairam\u2019s husband is a tractor driver in a local farm. She has to constantly invest 12 000 soms in the goods circulation of her shop. A monthly income of 5 000 soms helps her to keep business stability and a good economic welfare for her family.  Mairam hopes that Kiva\u2019s loan will help her to furnish her shop with a wide assortment of goods and attract more customers. \r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

He has done this for two years and says that it gets frustrating sometimes as he faces challenges such as perishable products, weather conditions and inflation. He believes that the secret of success in retail is high quality, so he tries to deliver wholesale goods on time and at a more affordable price than his competitors. \r\n\r\nThe idea for the business came from Azamat\u2019s mother, who helped him start it by buying three sacks of potatoes. Since then Azamat has achieved good results. He\u2019s earned enough to pay his university tuition and has applied for a loan from Kiva, because he would like to purchase a small shop. Working in an open air market makes it more difficult for him to deliver his services, especially in cold winter conditions. Teenage labor has increased recently in Kyrgyzstan.

K., the 34-year-old treasurer of this group, is married and has two young sons. Her husband works in transportation services, while she has been involved in the retail of women's apparel in a local market for eight years. When he\u2019s free from work, her husband tries to substitute for her at work so that she can spend more time at home with the children. <p>\r\n\r\nStarting this business with a loan of 20,000 from a local bank, Aizada's good management enabled her to quickly repay the loan. She currently earns a monthly income of 7,800 soms and has thus far been able to purchase nice furniture for their house.<p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting from Kiva, Aizada plans to purchase more goods and diversify her assortment. The anticipated profit will be spent on purchasing a permanent place for retail in the market and an automobile. <p>   \r\n     \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

The family invested 12,000 KGS of its savings to purchase dairy cows and cattle for resale. A good return from this business is always a promising contribution to the family budget. The monthly return from the business is about 3,000 KGS, which is spent on cattle feed, milk transportation and the family's use. Ainura sees a very promising future for her business because she\u2019s looking forward to becoming partners with local milk product firms and individual retailers. The purpose of this loan is to purchase furniture for Ainura's house.

She is married and has three children. Her husband is a head of \u201caiyl okmotu\u201d, which in Kyrgyz means a village. He is responsible for all the activities of the village, its security and the development of business. That makes Gulmira feel responsible too. \r\n\r\nGulmira is a teacher of Russian language and literature in local high school. Unfortunately, a teachers\u2019 salary is just a little bit above the minimum wage level. Because it\u2019s far from enough to make a living, most teachers look for a second job or start a small business. Gulmira saves most of her salary to pay the tuition of her two college aged children.  Additionally to her work in school, Gulmira also breeds livestock to resell. Her business was started 20 years ago with the purchase of a young calf for 5000 soms. Gulmira raised the calf and resold it, for a generated profit she bought another one. Following this strategy, Gulmira has accomplished a lot, and considerably increased the number of her cattle. Now she\u2019s built a paddock for cattle and provides good living conditions for the cattle. The purpose of the loan is to buy additional livestock and resell them at a good price. The anticipated profit will be spent on making major repairs at her house.\r\n\r\n        --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously). \r\n\r\nMBF is the only Microfinance Institute in Kyrgyzstan that delivers its services to customers 365 days a year.

She retails her goods, for cash or credit, from her home and at the market in Pelengana to a clientele made up of women and men.\r\n\r\nMrs Mariama Djir\u00e9 expects to make an average profit of 35,000 CFA francs a month, which will be reinvested in her business and spent to pay for household expenses and health care for her children. Her ambition is to buy a plot of land and have her own house in S\u00e9gou.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":708149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Pelengana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-02-07T12:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84317.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918252,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T08:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":84317.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361215,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-22T07:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":84317.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226495,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84317.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301337,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":84317.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580916,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84317.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750741,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-07T20:27:57Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":271105,"name":"Deggo Book Ligguey Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 DEGGO BOOK LIGGUEY est cr\u00e9\u00e9 depuis trois ans.

Almost no one stays untouched by it. The costs of operating a business rise, which forces entrepreneurs to raise prices for products and services, which further scares away some of the customers. \r\n\r\nTurdukan Z., 27, is a member of this group. She is single and doesn\u2019t have any financial dependents. Her father has always been a cattle breeder so Turdukan inherited love for animals and the skills of taking care of them. When she began leading an independent lifestyle, her father recommended for her to start cattle breeding on her own. Without any hesitation Turdukan agreed and bought a couple of heads of cattle. Year by year Turdukan\u2019s assets of cattle are growing in number. It creates a new problem for her. How to solve transportation issues? When she had few heads of cattle, that was not such a big issue, but now it requires a bigger truck and higher costs. So Turdukan turned to Mol Bulak Finance for help. Being offered a loan by Kiva, she was in heaven from happiness. It is such a great deal for her. Turdukan really hopes to get a loan which she plans to spend on buying additional cattle and a truck for transporting them to a local cattle yard. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is the treasurer of her group. She is married and has a seven-month-old toddler. While she is at work, she relies on a nanny to look after him. Gulkiya\u2019s husband had to leave to go to Russia because he was offered a much better job. Both of them hope that soon things will be figured out and that they will have a chance to bring the whole family together. \r\n\r\nEvery morning Gulkiya says good bye to her child until the evening, and leaves for work as early as possible. Retailing consumer goods is highly competitive, leading people to come up with new ideas for promoting their products. Every seller has his or her own techniques ranging from allowing customers to bargain to making gifts to customers. Gulkiya believes in a saying \u201cthe early bird catches the worm\u201d and tries to open up early to attract early customers wandering in a market. Gulkiya faces severe competition, so she does her best to stand out from the crowd. \r\n\r\nGulkiya's parents operated the business throughout their whole life. They gave Gulkiya the business ten years ago when. By watching her parents serve customers, Gulkiya already knew the successful techniques of retail. Ten years of hard work has brought its fruits. Gulkiya made a gift to her husband. She bought an automobile that he was dreaming of for a very long time. At this moment the business generates a monthly income of 7,000 soms for Gulkiya. She plans to spend the requested loan on buying more consumer goods. Over the next months she expects to have high demand and truly believes she will be repay the loan on time and without any violations.\r\n      \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is a widow and lives with her four-year-old grandson. Anipa\u2019s grandson goes to a daycare, and Anipa devotes the whole day to a business of cattle breeding. Two years ago her son recommended that she start this business, and since then she hasn\u2019t regretted doing so once. Anipa buys young calves, breeds them and resells them in a local market. She gathered a group with three other stock breeders and applied for a loan from Kiva through its partner Mol Bulak Finance. The proceeds from this investment will help her to improve living conditions for her grandson. Anipa also runs a dairy business and sells milk to a local market every morning. Her primary challenges were high costs for transportation and feeding the cattle, but despite those hardships Anipa believes she will overcome all challenges and expand her business. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Advantages are that it does not need a large start-up capital and there is always a high demand. While disadvantages are that most of these goods are perishable, therefore need fast sales. \r\n\r\nKanybek A., 34, is a member of this group. He is single and lives with only person who is financially dependent on him,  a seven-year-old nephew. Kanybek really wants his nephew to grow to be an independent, educated person and he does his best to provide him with all the necessities. Therefore, 4 years ago, Kanybek made his first steps into the business sphere. He used 75,000 soms of his savings to start the wholesale of consumer goods in a market of his home-town, Kerben. He plans to spend a loan from Kiva on investing in goods circulation. He expects to earn 7,000 soms per month, which will be used to make the payments for this loan, to pay health-care related expenses and to take a better care of his nephew. The remaining portion will be put back into his business. Kanybek has fought so that he and his nephew won\u2019t lack anything. He pledges to successfully repay the loan and dreams to open a chain of shops in future. \r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Masimkan is one of those who developed her talent thanks to this loan.\r\n\r\nMasimkan T., 54, is a leader of this group. She is divorced and lives with a young grandson. For last ten years she\u2019s been doing a small business by offering sewing services. In the beginning she was offering just small services in repairing of clothes. Later she applied for her first loan from Kiva through its Kyrgyz partner, Mol Bulak Finance. It really helped her to promote her business and to realize her new ideas. She brought new innovations into her clothing industry. Step by step she transferred to designing national clothing and to set her level of qualification higher. Soon she tended to have permanent customers ordering new designs on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nWith her second loan from Kiva, Masimkan plans to purchase new high-quality fabrics and to design new styles of outfits. Every month she gets income of 7,000 soms, which she spends on daily needs for herself and her grandson. A portion of her profit is reinvested back into the business and the rest is saved. Masimkan was very happy when she saved enough to purchase home electronics and to send her son to Russia to find a permanent job. For Masimkan, this is a second loan offered by Kiva, so she is sure she\u2019ll do her best to repay the loan on time, according to the schedule.\r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Such companies as Bishkek-Sut and Vimm Bil Dan provide the residents with high quality milk products. According to statistics an average person consumes milk products at least once a day.\r\n\r\nBusara J., 47, is a leader of this group. She is married to a farmer and has a twelve-year-old daughter. She started her business of milk production in 2003 and hasn\u2019t regretted it at all. First she purchased a dairy cow and sold the generated milk to friends from the neighborhood every morning. Busara's business became so popular in the neighborhood that she had to buy more dairy cows in order to generate more milk. Soon local ice-cream and cake producers started purchasing her milk on a regular basis. They liked high quality of this raw material. The next idea was to diversify her products. Busara bought new equipment for making high sorted cheese, sour cream and butter. She loved how everything worked out and sold all of her products almost immediately. The reason Busara applied for this loan is that she\u2019s in need of new equipment for making milk products because her old one is getting exhausted. Busara\u2019s dream is a two-storied big house where her daughter would be happy to live. \r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is married and has a sixteen-year-old son. Since her childhood, she has been very close to animals. She used to take the cattle to the pastures high in the mountains and look after them until the sun set. However, Gulmira wouldn\u2019t have a cattle business now if not for her husband\u2019s friend, who suggested to them to start breeding and reselling cattle three years ago. \r\n\r\n<p>Gulmira and her husband have come from humble beginnings to impressive results. The cycle of buying and reselling cattle has generated a considerable income for the family. With 15,000 KGS of start-up capital, Gulmira improved her business to earn 4,000 KGS per month. Gulmira is planning to constantly improve her living conditions. She would like to use this loan to buy furnishings for the house.

In the summer, it\u2019s much easier to feed cattle. Hojiakbar usually takes them to pastures high in the mountains, where they get plenty of fresh food and water.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been manufacturing and selling school uniforms for the past 17 years.  For the past three years she\u2019s had a workshop installed in her patio.  Her family helps her cut and assemble the school uniforms; her daughter embroiders and her husband helps her cut after he gets home from work.\r\n\r\nTwo schools are her frequent buyers.  She delivers school uniforms to them (skirts, pants and sweatshirts) from November through April.  Sonia also has individual customers for whom she makes sweatshirts and parkas for winter.  With this loan Sonia will buy fabric and collars for t-shirts.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her number of customers; in other words, include an additional school as a regular customer as well as increase her individual customers so that production will increase and thus her profits as well.  And in addition to this, she wants to be well known.\r\n\r\nFor Sonia, loans from Fondo Esperanza have been fundamental for her business because they have made it possible to finance and increase production.  Thanks to income from her business Sonia has been able to pay for her daughter\u2019s higher education.\r\n\r\nRecoleta is one of the 34 communes in Santiago (capital of Chile) and is located in the north-central part of Santiago\u2019s metropolitan area.

With the loans she received from AFODENIC, Luisa was able to add rooms.  Now with this new loan, she plans to replace the roof over her patio before winter begins.  She will buy sheets of zinc, lumber, and nails so that the work can begin.  Luisa wants to build an additional room, so she hopes to obtain another loan in the future to accomplish this goal.

She says that the members gave the group this name because very close to their town there is a hill with this name so they decided to give the group the same name.\n\nLupita, as she is known by her neighbors and acquaintances, is from the town of L. Segunda Manzana D. Nicol\u00e1s Romero which is located in the State of Michoac\u00e1n.  She is 27 years old and she tells us that she didn't study because her parents never sent her to school.  She is married to Gilberto, who is a construction worker, and they have 5 children: 9 year-old Juan Jos\u00e9 and 6 year-old Gilberto, who are both attending elementary school, 5 year-old Valeria who is in pre-school and 6 month-old Luis.  She is requesting a loan to invest in buying hens.  She says that she raises the hens and fattens them over the course of two months.  She then sells them to customers in her town.  Lupita tells us that the loan will be very useful to her as she will be able to buy more hens and will have more customers because she will sell her animals wholesale and will make more profits.\n\nLupita's goal is to be able to proviD. her animals to the people in her town who sell chicken at a good price so that they don't have to go to Zit\u00e1cuaro to buy their chickens.  She would also like to have a bigger coop because she can no longer fit all her hens in her existing coop.\n\nRosa Mar\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez C. is a member of the \"El Cacique\" group.  She is 21 years old and studied up to the third year of high school.  She then decided to pay her way through beauty school, since while in high school she had enjoyed doing her friends' hair, and she also realized that there were not any estheticians working in her neighborhood. Rosy, as she is know locally, is single and lives with her parents. She has a small salon in her house, and does hair cuts for women, men and children, and also does coloring, braiding, and styling for special events such as birthday parties. She has been working in her salon roughly four years and decided to start the business because there was nothing similar close to her house, and she also wanted to help her parents with household expenses. With her loan, she will buy locally produced dyes, combs, brushes and other necessary goods for her salon. Her goal is to increase her business, given that it is currently very small, to paint her salon and to put up a sign so as to increase the number of clients that she has. \n\nThe other 16 members of this group are: Isidra L\u00f3pez Avil\u00e9s, Nemesia Jer\u00f3nimo Gonz\u00e1lez, Mar\u00eda Cristina Rinc\u00f3n Jer\u00f3nimo, Laura Cecilia L\u00f3pez T., Mar\u00eda Teresa L\u00f3pez G., Alicia M.

","en":"The following group is located in the community of Yondes\u00e9 del Cerdero, San Jos\u00e9 del Rinc\u00f3n.  It is a community of very limited economic resources.  The community has been paved through a little bit of work which was carried out by the town authorities but before it was just dust and loose sand.  The houses are mainly made of adobe and many are also made from wood.  The people do not know how to read, except the children who attend school. Most of the community is still just sand as the only bit that was paved was the main road.  The people are very simple, humble, kind and polite.  They haven't lost the good manners that they had in the past.\r\n\r\nThe 'Los Ositos' (Little Bears) group has 8 members: 7 women and 1 man.  All of the members are neighbors and friends.  The main business activity carried out in this community is raising livestock (pigs, sheep, cows and poultry).  The mode of transportation continues being horses.  Although the truck does pass through it isn't very frequent.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members of this group are as follows:\r\n1.-Herminia C. U. - 39 years old\r\n2.-Antonia C. C. - 58 years old\r\n3.-Consuelo P. U. - 58 years old\r\n4.- Catalina U. C. - 51 years old\r\n5.-Sandra Garc\u00eda H. - 28 years old\r\n6.-Rocio S. R. - 32 years old\r\n7.-Leonardo C. C. - 33 years old\r\n8.-Ana Maria F. C. - 35 years old\r\n\r\nThe members of this group gave themselves the name 'Los Ositos' (Little Bears) because they didn't know what name to give their group and the names they chose were already taken by other groups.   One of the member's daughters would bring with her a teddy bear that she would cuddle and so they gave their group this name.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is Rocio.  Rocio tells us that the members of her group have known each other for years and they have worked together before.  She tells us that they are all trustworthy and hard-working people.  They need financial help to get ahead in life.  All the members of her group raise livestock which they fatten and then sell.  Her business is buying and selling lambs.  She also has a small store in her home where she sells soft drinks and also some candy and cookies.  She raises turkeys and horses.  She has a little of everything which helps her to cover her household expenses.\r\n\r\nRocio tells us that it is becoming hard to feed her animals because the pasture will be finished soon and they have to buy.  She tells us that the loans help her a lot because she can buy the animals she wants for cash and this makes her more profit because she can acquire them more cheaply.

The nine group members are neighbors and relations from the village of El Valerio.  They decided to give their group this name because they like it having the same name as their village.  They tell us that they don't know what the name means but they really like how it sounds.  The village of El Valerio is very small.  There are very few inhabitants.  Most people sell products but some also raise animals and farm.\r\n\r\nThis group has 9 members: 8 women and 1 man.  The names of the group's members are as follows:\r\n1.-Concepcion, J. D.

Instalments can be paid weekly or fortnightly, depending on the preference of her customers.

Her goal is to set up a clothes store which wiil be better as it means she won't get so tired.  Through her clothes business, Mariela makes enough money to buy food and clothes for her children.  Mariela helps her husband with their expenses so that they can get ahead in life.  She has 2 children: 1 boy and 1 girl.  The children are studying in kindergarten and elementary school.

It has 5 female members who know each other and are neighbors.  They are Sara J.

J., who will buy shoes to fill an order; Elizabeth Mart\u00ednez T., who will buy cosmetics and shoes to fill her orders; Mar\u00eda del Refugio T. M., who will buy manure to fertilize her irrigated fields and Claudia B. E. who will buy sugar, yoghurt, cheese and soft drinks to stock her business.\r\n\r\nClaudia B. E. is 35 years old and studied up to the third year of high school.  She is married and doesn't have any children.  She has a games machine business.  Claudia has requested her loan so that she can start stocking a grocery store.  She will buy sausages, ham, yoghurt, A\u00f1ejo cheese, Oaxaca cheese and soft drinks.  She will also buy paint so that she can paint her home.\r\n\r\nClaudia started her business a year ago as her household needed more income.  She has her games machines on commission and earns a percentage.  She used to sell 'picaditas' (filled cornmeal shells) and 'dobladitas' (a kind of quick bread).  She would like to go back to selling 'picaditas' and 'dobladitas'.  Her business is important because it makes her income.  She has money so that she doesn't want for anything, her business is located in her home and she doesn't pay rent.  Her customers are the children who come to play on the machines.  Her business has competition from another person who has games machines.\r\n\r\nClaudia uses the profits from her business to buy food.  She is planning to expand her business, set up her grocery store and sell 'picaditas' and 'dobladitas'.  She hopes to use her loans to achieve this.  Her business has helped her financially.  The improvements she would like to make to her home are to put down flooring, buy some stools and remodel her water tank.  Her hopes are to grow her business and to put down flooring in her home.\r\n\r\nClaudia is happy to be receiving this loan which she has been given so that her business can grow and become well known.   The members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Many thanks for your help.  Please lower the interest rates so that we can manage and so that all is well.  Let's see if you can lower the interest rates and continue lending to us\".\r\n\r\nJaloxtoc is a beautiful village.  From it, you can see the countryside and the hills.

The members decided to name the group for a local wood of the same name.  Here's the story of Clara O. A., one member of the group. She's 30-years-old, and married with two children, Ang\u00e9lica, 11, and Abel, 9, both in school.  The eldest is in sixth grade and the youngest is in fourth.  Clara earns her living selling Mexican finger-foods.\r\n\r\nShe decided on this business because there's high demand and good profits, in addition to the fact that she was looking for a way to improve the quality of life for herself and her family and provide a really good education for her kids.  She invested her loan in more ingredients, including: chiles, onions, corn, etc., so she could increase production and offer a wider variety of products in order to increase sales a bit.\r\n \r\nClara says business is going super-well, so well that she's starting to save up part of her profits to finish building the kitchen in her house, to keep supporting the kids' education so they can have really good professional careers, and to continue investing in her business. \r\n\r\nClara says that her business has benefited quite a bit from the locals in her town, because there aren't many people in the same business nearby.  Everyone buys from her because she's the only one, she's close by, and she offers excellent attention and service to her clientele.\r\n\r\nClara's dream is to build a shop, right in her house, so she can expand her business a little.  What she really wants is to put in a little restaurant so she can stock more items, bring in more income, and continue supporting the kids' higher education so they'll have really good professions.\r\n\r\nClara tells us the members of her group are very responsible people who make their payments. They've had time to get to know each other and they get along very well; plus, they're from the same community so they've never been late or failed to pay their loans off, because they don't want to destroy the trust the organization has placed in them.\r\n\r\nClara really appreciates Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for supporting them with loans; thanks to that, her business is really improving and her and her family's lives are changing.\r\n\r\nThe members of the \u201cEl Bocotito\u201d group and their businesses are: \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda B.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk foods & toothpaste in the local community. Chequita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Chequita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Chequita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital.

The members live in the municipality of Tecoanapa Guerrero and decided on this name for the group because it is the name of the community where the majority of the members live.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Maribel C. L. is the representative of the group and this is her story. She is 38 years old, married, and has four children: Alejandra, Eduardo, Estefan, and Luceli. They all attend school; the eldest is in first year college, the second in second year of high school, the last two are in the fourth and sixth year of primary school. Maribel\u2019s job is selling cosmetics from a catalog.\r\n\r\nShe decided to start this business because she needed to provide a better standard of living for herself and her family and to help her children get ahead. As she could not afford to educate her children well nor assist her husband with household expenses, she took on a loan to buy catalogs and more merchandise such as lipstick, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to start the business.\r\n\r\nShe says that the business has helped her a lot and she now can pay for her children\u2019s studies and improve their quality of life. The money she earns has improved the family\u2019s financial situation and she is now saving to buy a stove since the one that she has is very old.\r\n\r\nSra. Maribel wishes to invest more money in her business so that it can expand much more. For that reason she wants to build a bigger store from which to sell her beauty products. She will be able to have a greater variety and thus increase sales and income. Then she can continue helping her children through school so they can get good jobs and have a better future.\r\n\r\nMaribel says that all the members of the group are responsible people who pay back their loans. They all know each other since they\u2019re from the same community and they are all friends so there are no problems between them. Up to now no one has failed to make their repayments as they are responsible, punctual and hardworking.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of the Las Animas group and the business in which they will invest their loan:\r\nMar\u00eda Victoria Angel B.-selling sandals\u2028\r\nRafaela G.

All the members live on the same street. One member, Rosalia, is 30 years old, a single mother with 3 children, 2 of whom are in school. The oldest is in 6th year of primary and the other is in 4th year. The youngest is just 2 years old. Rosalia has had a grocery store for 5 years.\r\n\r\nShe chose to open this business because she was looking for a means of supporting and advancing her children, and of solving economic problems, and improving her quality of life, since she couldn't count on help from anyone. Rosalia is requesting a loan to continue investing in her store, buying more merchandise such as soft drinks, water, cooking oil, eggs, salt, sugar, soap, toilet paper, and other articles, to continue her sales.\r\n\r\nRosalia's business is serving her well. From the earnings, she is able to continue helping her children with their studies, and cover personal expenses, and to continue improving her quality of life. She is also saving to buy a washing machine, which she lacks and really needs.\r\n\r\nRosalia says that her goal is to make her business grow as an enterprise. She wants to build a larger store. What she most desires is to convert her small store into a real grocery, and to have it well stocked and, thus, to obtain more and better earnings.\r\n\r\nRosalia says she knows her fellow members very well and she comments that they are very responsible and hard-working people, and she is confident that they have the urge to get ahead and overcome, and for that reason, in no occasion have they fallen behind in their loan payments, since they want to continue counting on the help of more loans.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva investors for providing this opportunity and having confidence, but above all, for believing in her, since thanks to their help, she can invest in her business and, thus, enjoy a better quality of life together with her family, and a better future.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Los Jimenez Group and their activities are as follows:\r\nAntonia O.

It is made up of 5 women who are neighbors and know each other well. \r\n\r\nMs. Petra A. M. is going to use her loan to buy clay, wood and glaze for the manufacture of pots and jars and she also sells unglazed pots. \r\n\r\nMs. Jorgina B. T. is going to buy clay, wood and paints for making pots. \r\n\r\nMs. Margarita M. V. is going to buy wood, clay, and glaze to make pots and jars for the Day of the Dead. \r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Myriam Guzm\u00e1n C. is going to buy bags of sugar, boxed oil, sweets and boxed juices to stock her business selling cakes, picaditas and dobladitas (various traditional fast food items).\r\n\r\nMs. Irene C. Arriza is going to buy pots and pans to stock her business. She is going to buy glaze, wood, paint, and clay to manufacture large and small pots and pans. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Myriam is a member of the group. She is 22 years old and she has her high school diploma. She is married and does not have any children. She has a business selling food in the telesecundaria (a distance school program for secondary and high school students). She is requesting a loan to buy oil, rice, sugar, sweets, soft drinks, vegetables, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and cream. She is also going to fix her bathroom and construct it using brick rather than bamboo. Her customers are students, teachers, parents and she offers them tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, tortas, sweets and soft drinks. She started her business 3 years ago out of necessity and learned by watching others prepare. Her mother taught her to prepare food, and the parent committee at the school told her that since there wasn't anyone to sell food at school if she wanted to do so she could and she liked the idea. Her father-in-law lent her the money to start sales. She walks to work, carrying her goods in a wheelbarrow. Her business is important and special to her because she eats there. What she likes most about her job is when she sells, when the boys buy her foods and do not walk away. The greatest challenge she faces is the weather, when it rains, or when the boys do not bring money because sales decrease. Her competition is a lady who sells the same products in the school. She uses her business profits to go shopping in the center every eight days for food supplies, to stock her food supply, repay the loan, and to pay her dues from selling to the telesecundaria. Her husband helps with overall food sales and he knows how to do everything. \r\n\r\nSan Marcos is a nice place to breathe fresh air. They celebrate the patron saint of San Marcos on April 25. There are masses, procession, dances, carnival rides, Brinco de Chinelos (traditional indigenous dance from the state of Morelos), the planting of corn and sorghum, and almost all do pottery work. \r\n\r\nThis business has helped in feeding their family. The plans and hopes are to continue with the business selling food to make earnings to buy a car to use to go and buy the merchandise and to travel from their house to the school with their food. \r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Miriam is happy with this loan because she is able to continue growing her business. The members of the this group want to tell Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for the support and the trust you give us, thanks to these loans we can get ahead in our business and our families\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":705465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase packages of sugar, boxed oil, rice, sweets, juices, soft drinks, vegetables, green and red tomatoes, chiles, cheese, cream","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Barrio San Pedro, Acteopan, Estado de Puebla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-09T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Myriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":240.63,"local_amount":2875,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850155,"comment":null},{"amount":721.87,"local_amount":8625,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8651.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292429,"comment":null},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5767.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160687,"comment":null},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5767.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-12T21:39:42Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":271364,"name":"Lucila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucila C. is from the village of Malagana, Claveria, Misamis Oriental.

She thanks God for this ranch because it has fully supported her for 25 years.\r\n\r\nThe profit she makes from each sale is invested in this work, to clean her plantation, so that when the harvest comes in it is clean and the staff can work comfortably.\r\n\r\nShe wants to continue working as long as God gives her life, so that she can provide the best for her children and they finish a career. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dora was invited to join this group by Mrs. M\u00e1xima, who brings this group together to request loans, so she can also work.

It is located in the T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n community in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  It is made up of 4 female members that know each other and are neighbors.  Members Se\u00f1ora Fabiola Rodr\u00edguez A. and Se\u00f1ora Valentina M. Jim\u00e9nez are going to use the loan to purchase men's, women's and children's footwear out of seasonal catalogs to fill orders. Se\u00f1ora Ma Anselma M. P. is going to purchase seeds such as beans, corn, pasilla, guagillo and lentils to stock her business.   Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda de Lourdes V. C. is going to buy beans, corn, soap, oil, soups and toilet paper to stock her business.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Fabiola Rodr\u00edguez A. is 33 years old and studied until her 3rd year of high school.  She is married and has 3 children, Johan, 6, attends elementary school, Pamela, 4, is in preschool and Marco Antonio is 2.  Se\u00f1ora Fabiola has a business selling footwear from catalogs, prepared elotes [Mexican corn on the cob] and prepared chicharrones [fried pork rinds].  She is requesting a loan to purchase men's, women's and children's footwear to fill her orders.  She started this business 4 years ago when her sister-in-law invited her and assured her that she would sell shoes.  She then went to Cuautla to purchase catalogs and shoes with the money that her husband sent from his earnings working in the United States.  She does business on an itinerant basis, walking around selling her products.  This business offers the advantage of letting her work in her free time and not have to worry about care for her children.  She enjoys selling footwear as her customers are her neighbors, family members and girls.  The weather presents a disadvantage of this business because when it rains she can't go out and sell.  She uses her earning to purchase more shoes.  She is planning to expand her business by carrying other brands of shoes.  \r\n\r\nT\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n is beautiful because of its scenery and its cool climate.  It is hilly with lots of trees and abundant vegetation.  Peaches, avocado, loquat, plums and pomegranate grow here.  They also plant beans and corn.   Her business has helped her family economically by supporting her children's education.  She wants to make improvements to her house and buy doors.  Her plans and hopes are to have more products and open a shoe store, displaying the catalogs.  Se\u00f1ora Fabiola is excited about the loan because she will be able to buy new seasonal catalogs and fill her orders.  Her goals are to continue supporting her children's education and to keep selling footwear.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"we are grateful for the opportunity that you are offering us.  Thanks to your support we will be able to grow our businesses.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":706439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase men's, women's and children's footwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tetela del Volcan, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-09T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabiola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Anselma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2022.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850158,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6067.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292432,"comment":null},{"amount":302.39,"local_amount":3583.92,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3624.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160690,"comment":null},{"amount":372.61,"local_amount":4416.08,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4465.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233564,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T07:03:37Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":271375,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda A. is 30 years old, married and has three adult-aged children.

This group is made up of 10 humble women with good intentions. All of them are neighbors in this area. They all work in trade, most embroider napkins and Nahua (dresses), and are hardworking and responsible women.\r\n\r\nThe representative of this group is Lucia J. A., 49 years old and married to Marcelino Garcia L\u00f3pez who is a police officer. They have 8 children, 6 of which live with them. Lucia studied only through primary school. \r\n\r\nLucia is requesting a loan to buy thread to make napkins. She uses the following: white linen, silk thread, cord, etc. In addition to embroidery she also sells chicken, so with the remainder of the loan she will buy chickens. \r\n\r\nLucia has been in this business for 10 years and has learned to make the products from taking a course. She doesn't have a central spot where she sells the napkins, but she brings them to the surrounding communities to sell. Her products are different sizes and vary in price according to the type of thread she uses and the size. She sells products for any where from 20 pesos to 200 pesos. \r\n\r\nPreviously she belonged to a group called \"Sangre India\" where together with other women they made the fabric of the napkins and had a person who collected and sold their products nationally, but as time went by the group broke up and now everyone sells their own products.\r\n\r\nWith the income she receives from sales, Lucia invests in a musical group called \"Santiago\" in which her youngest son plays the drums.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is for her work to be recognized worldwide, that people from abroad will to buy her products, and with great effort and dedication she can achieve this. \r\n\r\nShe feels very happy to receive this loan and thanks the foundation for providing people like her with loans.\r\n\r\nThe women that make up this group are the following:\r\n\r\nAndrea M.

P. is from the village of Sta. Cruz, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. He is 40 years old. Glen is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Glen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector. He operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from the buying and selling of coconuts in the local community. Glen has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Glen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Glen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Glen is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional coconuts to buy and sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Glen from HSPFI.

B. is from the village of Eastern, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 40 years old. Marilou is married and has 2 school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Marilou owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, snack foods, mineral water, salt by the pack & toothpaste, to the local community. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marilou joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & fund working capital. \r\n\r\nMarilou is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, like shampoo and soaps. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Marilou from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

M. is a 50-year-old farmer who lives in the north of Kyrgyzstan.  He was born and grew up in a family of farmers in Tajikistan. He got married at the age of 19 and soon became the father of three sons. In 2003, Nurbek and his family moved to Kyrgyzstan and bought a house in Belovodskoe village. In order to find a means of subsistence for his family, Nurbek started his business of cattle breeding and land cultivating. With the initial capital of 10,000 KGS, he managed to earn about $150 in a month through selling tomatoes and meat products. \r\n\r\nNurbek works hard to make this business successful and now plans to develop it with the help of a loan of 50,000 KGS. With the revenue from this investment, Nurbek wants to help his elder son in purchasing a house.

They are small businesswomen who have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva, in order to ask for a loan of 800,000 SLL for each in the group. With this loan, they will be able to add more goods to their businesses, attract more customers, make more sales and profits, and consequently improve on their living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group of entrepreneurs is Fatmata K..

They are blessed with four children and they are living in Nitop - 4, an area in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon\r\n\r\nR. has faced some major challenges in her life: illness, poverty,  and especially that she never had the opportunity to attend school. The most difficult have been the problem of raising capital for her business and  paying for her children\u2019s education.  She plans to invest this loan in poultry, piggery and firewood businesses. With the production of chickens and firewood, she will be able to raise a lot of profit because they are highly demanded in her community. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time and has experience as far as this field is concerned. \r\n\r\nShe also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford at least good chicken for their meals, and in the North West region of Cameroon, chickens are valued and used to carry out traditional rites. So the business will be sustainable. And also, she will provide her community with good firewood which they will use as a fuel for cooking.\r\n\r\nR. will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's school fees and save for a rainy day. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":709090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"firewood,
