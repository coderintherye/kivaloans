Stepan produces and distributes advertising. His office is conveniently located in the city centre. He's been in this business for four years. Even after new competition appeared two years ago, Stepan's professionalism has allowed him to maintain his brand to this day. Stepan's current monthly income is slightly above 5000 hryvnia. With the help of this loan from Kiva, he hopes to purchase a large-format printer and to install windows in his office. The printer will expand the range of services that Stepan's company offers. The new windows will improve the insulation of the workspace, plus Stepan will be able to use them for additional advertisement.\r\n\r\nStepan was educated in Hungary.

Thanks to this important quality in her life, Nidia has been able to get ahead in life to such an extent that she now finds herself married and the mother of a son.  With her husband, Nidia took a store that they\u2019ve both been working at for a year.  Thanks to it they earn the necessary income to cover household expenses.  Nidia has always wanted her son to have the best possible education but her low income has not allowed her to offer this.\r\n\r\nNidia faces a large inconvenience because her store does not have a tent over it to protect it from the rain so that every time it starts to rain she has to close the store so that it won\u2019t fill up with water.  Hoping that this situation can change, Nidia is seeking a loan that will allow her to buy a tent to cover the store and protect it from the rain so that she doesn\u2019t have to close every time it rains.  Nidia states that this way her income will increase considerably because she\u2019ll have the store open more hours per day and thanks to its good location people will relate to it and lead to its better positioning in her sector.\r\n\r\nNidia hopes that with the increase in her income she\u2019ll be able to improve her current quality of life and be able to save so that she can reach her dream in the future of providing her son with the best possible education so that he can get a job that will generate more income than what she earns in the store.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":44.96,"image":{"id":983926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a tent to protect herself from the rain.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T18:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-18T18:00:10Z","loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81751},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":84052},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":86418},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":88851},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91351},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":93923},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":96566},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":99284},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":102079},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":104952},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":107906},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":110944},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":114066},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":117277},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":120580}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.96,"local_amount":81751,"processed_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":82642.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362165,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T16:46:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382554,"name":"Tom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tom is a twenty-five-year-old married man living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Her parents did not have stable income when she was young and the family struggled with many difficult financial situations. That's why Fabiola is so motivated now to create financial stability for her family. \r\n\r\nShe has many loyal customers who consistently order from her, but unfortunately her customers often pay on credit and Fabiola struggles to maintain enough working capital to keep her business running.

He learned the trade by helping his grandfather.  It is from his grandfather that he inherited this trade and under his grandfather that he learned the business.  Through his meat business, Alvaro has managed to provide for his family which consists of his wife and his five children who are between 4 and 26 years old.  When he got married and took on the responsibilities of a head of household, Alvaro turned to his knowledge of the trade and set up his own business in his in-laws' house.  More than 10 years ago, he acquired business premises in the main square in Arjona, on a plot of land belonging to his sister.  His business has done very well there.  He still has the same sales location and he distributes his produce to stores.  However, when his customer numbers increase, his working capital is not sufficient.  In particular, during holiday periods he needs to have his business stocked with larger quantities of produce.  For this reason, he is requesting a Kiva loan, which is the first loan he has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use his loan to buy beef in larger quantities and deliver larger quantities to the stores where he has already pre-sold it.  Alvaro's dream is to increase his income and provide his children with a better education.  Whilst this is happening, his investment profitability is 82.27% and it is from this point that he is planning his future, strengthening his business through his loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":43.9,"image":{"id":984235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beef in larger quantities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Arjona (Bolivar)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-19T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alvaro Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":78294},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":80121},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":81991},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83904},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85862},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87865},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":89915},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":92013},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":94160},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":96357},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":98606},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100912}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.03},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":78294,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":80694.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T07:22:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382935,"name":"Suhayl","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438. \u0415\u043c\u0443 28 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443.","en":"Suhayl has been providing a taxi service for two years.

He graduated from the Yerevan Polytechnic Institute, where he obtained a speciality of engineer-radio technician.  Varuzhan is married and has two children -  a son and a daughter.  His son attends a paid division of the Yerevan Medical University, and daughter goes to a secondary school.  Varuzhan spent many years working as a rescuer at the Ministry of Emergency Situations.  Since 2011, he has been involved in a private entrepreneurship at a leased space, where he sells accessories (purses, school briefcases, belts, umbrellas, watches, glasses, etc.).  Varuzhan buys merchandise for his store once per month at wholesale markets in Yerevan.  He has many regular customers, who prefer to make their purchases specifically at his store, due to the quality of merchandise and Varuzhan's kindness.

Giovanny hopes that with the improvements to the locale and with the increase in products on offer his sales will increase considerably so that he can generate sufficient capital to provide his son with the best possible education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":39.15,"image":{"id":985309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to do some improvements to his locale and increase the selection of products in stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Marinilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T00:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-20T00:20:08Z","loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovanny Alfonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":71182},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73190},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75255},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77377},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":79560},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81805},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84112},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86485},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88925},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91433},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94012},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96664}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.15,"local_amount":71182,"processed_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":71895.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362185,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T14:55:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383425,"name":"Adiba","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0434\u0438\u0431\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u042f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u0439 31 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0410\u0434\u0438\u0431\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430.","en":"Adiba lives in the Yavan region.

He is married to a businesswoman and has one child aged 17 years. In 2006, Anthony established his drinks, milk, ovaltine, liquor, sugar, butter, baby cream, and soap business. He began his business because his parents were business people and he grew up in the business even though he was going to school. But he paid more attention to the business and after he left school, he decided to continue with it. Working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, he earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Anthony requires a loan in order to purchase phones - 20 pieces @ Le200,000, savanna* drinks - 5 crates @ le120,000 and maltina** drinks - 4 crates @ Le100,000.  He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 750,000. In the future, Anthony plans to become an international businessman.  The business is good as it helps in adding to his capital. He hope to educate his child as he will make more profit out of it.  He usually experiences challenges due to the change in the exchange rate.  He doesn\u2019t have competition as his shop is the only cosmetic and provision shop in the area. He serves students from the nearby college and people around town.  He serves about 40 people a day.  He treats his customers well.

This group is composed of 15 entrepreneurs (women and men) located in the city of San Pedro de Macoris. Their community is a rural area surrounded by fields of sugarcane. She works selling miscellaneous products such as silver jewelry, clothes and shoes. She will use her loan to purchase jewelry such as bracelets, rings, earrings, and some pairs of shoes for women and men. \r\n\r\nDamaris is a mother of three children and they still live together with their father (her long-term partner). Her most important challenge is to ensure that her children have a good future. She will make it possible by working hard. Damaris is receiving her fifth loan from Esperanza Internacional and, because her loan repayments have all been made punctually, she has been able to grow her business with the re-investment she makes from each loan. She started her business three years ago and at that time only sold clothes. By taking loans, she started to introduce different products.

He is married to a trader and has two school-going children, ages 10 and 7 years. In 2004, Alieu established his provisions, toiletries and top cards (mobile) business. He did not go to school as his father does not respect education. His father was a cattle rearer and, when he grew up, he decided to join him in the same trade. During the war in Sierra Leone \u2013 specifically in his home town, Kabala \u2013 he lost all his cattle which forced him to come and settle in Makeni town, where he started as a peddler. Over some years, he raised a huge sum of money and opened a shop. Till now, his business has improved gradually.\r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, Alieu earns about 1,892,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. He is assisted by family members. Alieu has already received and successfully repaid one loan. He would like a new loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. He requires this loan in order to purchase cigarettes (Bond - 1 carton for 1,000,000 SLL and Gold Seal for 600,000 SLL), top-up cards (30,000 units for 38,000 SLL), sugar (2 bags for 260,000 SLL) and toothpaste (1 carton for 140,000 SLL). He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 473,000 SLL.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Alieu plans to open a bigger outlet to display his goods. He is nervous about the future prospects of his business because he wants to open a bigger shop so that he can be selling wholesale. The rise and fall in foreign currency can cause high prices in the cost of goods, and while meeting customers\u2019 needs, sometimes it affects his sales and reduces his profit. Competition is not high because he is the only retailer in the area dealing with these products. \r\n\r\nAlieu serves about 50 people per day. He serves people from around the city \u2013 at least 20 people per day. He also serves people from the surroundings and people from nearby villages. His business is popular because he treats his customers fairly and respects their views. He buys his goods in Conakry twice per month and in Freetown once every week by vehicle. He uses his profit to buy more stock for his business. He is a hardworking and very committed businessman. He hopes to repay his loan on time in order to access subsequent loans.

Carlos Humberto is always seeking methods to be able to generate more income for his home.  He assures us that most important are his wife and son of 6 years, to whom he wants to offer everything that he needs to do well.  Approximately 4 and a half years ago, Carlos Humberto decided to set aside the activity of selling boxes in the food market of his region to open his own vegetable and fruit stand, as he saw that this activity would generate more income for his home.  Since then he has performed this activity and, thanks to his good service and the quality of the products that he offers his clients, he has been recognized in the sector and already has become  preferred by people at the moment they make their purchases.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the disadvantage that Carlos Humberto has with respect to the other people that sell vegetables and fruits in the same sector, is that Carlos Humberto does not have his own sales position, which means he must perform his sales on the outskirts of the other sales businesses.  For Carlos Humberto it has been very difficult to have to overcome said situation, and he declares that if he had his own sales location, his income would be a lot better than currently.

","en":"Suerkul is 60 years old. The main source of income for his family is animal husbandry. Thanks to Suerkul's persistence and perseverance, the farm, which was started with a sum of 25,000 som (KGS), currently brings in around 15,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of meat and dairy products. \r\n\r\nIn order to further increase the number of cattle, Suerkul turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of dairy cows. Suerkul plans to invest the income in further increasing the number of domestic animals.

With their combined efforts, they have breed two cows, two calves, and 20 chickens, and they grow fruit and vegetables and also fodder. \r\n\r\nThe dairy products, eggs, fruit, and vegetables they produce are for the family's use, and now Seyran intends to develop his farming and to start to breed pigs as well. Therefore, he needs a 900,000-Armenian-dram loan to buy some pigs and calves for his farm and also to buy deficient fodder for his farm animals.   \r\n\r\nThis is Seyran\u2019s third loan from Nor Horizon, and he always does his repayments in time.

The merchants are stocking their businesses, so that they can respond to their customers' requests with beverages, foods, handicrafts, costumes, parade floats and fairs, because of the popularity of the festival with the citizens of the city and the local and international tourists. As a single block, these festivals of the Colombian Caribbean, full of color and action, enlist the people to enjoy themselves and lose their inhibitions, wearing costumes, buying, and dancing. \r\n\r\nThis, as it happens, is what the business people like Arlett take advantage of, with her business of soft drinks and cold beverages. She plans to have a good stock so that her profits increase during this season, taking advantage of the extravagance of happiness of her customers. As it happens, her business was born out of the Barranquilla Carnival, when, in the year 1989, she was selling all the products of the Bavaria company at all the Carnival events in the city and in the township festivals in the districts. To do this, she didn't need any working capital, since they gave her the products on the consignment system, that is, she could return what she didn't sell. There she leaned to work independently, and little by little, with her work and her savings, she managed to buy beer, soft drinks, and Pony Malt (a non-alcoholic malt beverage) by the case, which she sold retail. Gradually, with the increase in her working capital, she managed to buy in larger quantities and also to sell wholesale. Now she is preparing again to respond to these festivities and she should be very well stocked with everything that the happiness of her customers requires of her. This is the reason she has turned to her Kiva loan, the first financing she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy beer in large volume, to sell at the various festivities and from her own home, infecting those who know her with much happiness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.25,"image":{"id":985515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beer in large volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T02:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-22T02:50:10Z","loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arlett Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":73173},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":74880},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76627},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78415},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80245},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82117},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84033},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85994},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88001},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":90054},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92155},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":94306}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.53},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.25,"local_amount":73173,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":73906.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325116,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T02:53:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382727,"name":"Aida Silvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aida Silvia es una persona ya grande de edad que es viuda desde hace unos a\u00f1os, de la manera que percibe ingresos es por medio de dos pensiones que se le deposita en largos periodos.

He is a construction worker and a plasterer.  Besides his work, he is also involved in fattening up and selling livestock.  Currently, he has several heads of sheep and goats at home.  His wife is a homemaker and is involved in raising children.
