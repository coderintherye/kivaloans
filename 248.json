It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jahongir is dedicated to rearing rabbits and cattle. With a lot of effort and sacrifice, he carries out this work every day for the purpose of improving the living conditions of his family, bringing the daily bread to his table and, at the same time, saving for the improvement of his dwelling, which needs a lot of help because it is in bad condition which, little by little, he has come to improve. <P>\r\n\r\nHis family admires him for the fact that his multiple efforts have permitted him to bring food to his home and that in addition, Jahongir has managed to keep his family in good living conditions. The need that this gentleman faces is that he needs to invest in his business through the purchase of cows for its development. By this he hopes that IMON International with the help of Kiva will offer him the loan so that he can do well, along with his family.   <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Anxious in making their agricultural businesses profitable, the members of BENKADI 1 group of Toura Nabitokan decided to join the loan program Soro Yiriwaso 2 years ago. After having repaid correctly the preceding loan, they are on their second  rural loan. This loan will be used to buy sufficient quantities of peanuts seeds, small materials and inputs for cultivation mainly at the big market of Kamparana. After the farming season, the harvests are stored for some time for them to gain value before being sold out at the big market of Kamparana and in surrounding markets by retail (often in bulk), for cash, to customers from the big towns.

Ella y su esposo trabajan muy duro para poder brindarles a sus hijos una buena calidad de vida y vieron en los pr\u00e9stamos de MFP una opci\u00f3n para incrementar la producci\u00f3n de su negocio.

She is 42 years old, happily married, and the mother of 2 children (ages 15 and 12).  Her family lives in their own home, which took much effort to build.  She and her husband work very hard to provide their children a good quality of life.  The loans from MFP were an option to increase production in their business.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor 19 years, they have been making various kinds of footwear.  They chose this line of business because they both had previous experience working in a shoe factory.  Since deciding to go into business for themselves, they have done very well.  Both Felipa and her husband enjoy what they do.  Even though they occasionally may be in disagreement, which is never easy, they manage to be patient with each other and put in many hours of work and dedication.\r\n<p>  \r\nFelipa is continually buying merchandise and moved downtown, which is 2 hours from their home, in search of the necessary materials to produce shoes and to coordinate orders with customers. This is why she is never at the shop, which operates out of their home.

Nicolasa sells health, beauty, and basic hygiene products from her home; in that way she can still be close to her kids. She lives in Barrio Lindo in San Pedro D. Macoris. Even though translated it means Beautiful neighborhood. Barrio Lindo can have its troubles. To name the most prominent ones, there is no constant running water - sometimes the town is left three to four days without water.  Electricity goes out unpredictably every day,  sometimes for a few hours but sometimes for half a day, and crime has risen so much that you cannot walk by yourself after it gets dark. Yet with all those circumstances Nicolasa\u2019s business has proven to be successful. She is now on her third loan with Esperanza and is quite satisfied with her steady income. She laughs and smiles at me, confessing that she wishes her business can keep on gaining momentum because one day she hopes to own her own car. \r\n\r\nPlease strongly consider loaning to Nicolasa.

She says she is very excited because she loves her job and looks forward to increasing the number of customers. \r\n\r\nDiser is is not married and has no children, which allows her to put a lot of time into her business. She hopes to build her business up enough so that she can support a family sometime in the future.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Diser and the entire Fuente de Bendicion group, thank you for providing opportunities to those who need them most!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":355043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Clorinda works two-three days in the city cleaning apartments as well as orchards close to the town, and the rest of the week she looks after her daughters and farms her land. She has few animals only for family use.\r\n<p>\r\nClorinda has lived on her own with her daughters for a year and a half as her husband has gone to work in the town of Guayaquil.

She has worked selling food since she was very young.  She had to interrupt her work in order to dedicate more attention to her children.  Now that they are older, she has started working again with the help of her partner and children.  They helped her get a food cart with which she sells meals from the door of her house.  She works every day, above all on the weekends due to the great demand.  She works from 5 p.m. until midnight since she takes advantage of the customers that are out at night.

She found the best support and the perfect company with her partner.  They have a son and they live together in a house that they were able to get through a lot of effort.  Ever since she learned the trade of seamstress, she began receiving large orders for embroidery, decorations, sewing clothes, etc.  This helped her improve her income.  Goya works out of her house in an area where she set up her small sewing workshop.  She buys the materials she uses wholesale to make a larger number of clothing articles.  She has been doing this for 2 years.  She took advantage of this time to get acquainted with various customers who are business owners and she hopes the list will continue to grow.  She hopes to count on better machinery in the near future to do additional jobs which would allow her to increase her income.

community (called a \"batey\") of La Gina, which lies in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic. Today, Ana Luisa is requesting a new loan - her seventh loan to date -- from Kiva and Esperanza International so she can buy more merchandise, including onions, eggplant, potatoes, salami, chicken, and used men's and women's clothing, for her store. When her loan is funded, Ana Luisa will travel by bus and\/or motorcycle taxi to La Romana, the closest big city, to buy the used clothing for her business, and she will go out further into the countryside to buy her produce from local farmers. \r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa's independent business is certainly a success story in its own right. She has been able to expand her business steadily over time, and she owns one of the most vibrant home enterprises in the La Gina batey. For example, the loan she will take out today is over twice the size of her very first loan, and she has expanded her merchandise offerings from chicken and used clothing to a whole variety of food and clothing goods. This is no small feat, considering that bateys are often the most economically stagnant communities in the Dominican Republic. Geographically isolated, and populated mostly by Dominicans of Haitian descent, who face the greatest difficulties in securing citizenship rights, starting and expanding a business in a rural batey is no easy task. Furthermore, it is especially impressive that Ana Luisa is able to take out a loan of this size at this time of the year, since commercial activity in the batey generally slows down considerably during the sugarcane off-season.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa uses the revenues from her business to help support her three grandchildren who live with her and her husband. She helps to pay for their school uniforms and school supplies, and she hopes that her business will continue to fund their education in the future. Ana Luisa has six grown children of her own and 25 grandchildren!<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa appears in the center of the photograph with her four fellow group members of the Pasos Firmes (Solid Steps)

Once her loan is funded, Maria will travel over three hours by bus to buy her merchandise in the capital city of Santo Domingo, and she will then sell her wares in her own community and in neighboring bateys.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>The revenues from Maria's in-home enterprise are crucial to the well-being of her family. Along with her husband's  earnings from cultivating and harvesting sugarcane, Maria's business supports six dependents, including four of her own children (ages 18, 16, and 15) and two nephews (ages 7 and 4). All of Maria's children attend school, and she hopes to be able to send them to the university some day. Maria recognizes the connection between the success of her business and the opportunities available to her children. She hopes her business will grow so that her children and nephews might have a better life. Currently, opportunities for socioeconomic mobility in the batey communities are scarce. The bateys are generally geographically isolated, and, because a majority of batey residents are of Haitian descent, they often face great challenges obtaining citizenship and other political rights in the Dominican Republic.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Maria is a member of Group 3 in the Pasos Firmes (Solid Steps) Bank of Hope.

P. is from the village of Unidos. She is 53 years old. Fe is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Fe owns & operates a business running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Fe has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Fe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Fe is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 16th loan taken out by Fe from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

B. is from the village of Sinayawan, Valencia. She is 46 years old and is married with two, school-aged children. To make a living, Perla owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. While not serving as the only means for generating revenue, Perla's main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling different consumer products in the local community. Perla has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Perla joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perla is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP of which she plans to use to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan for Perla from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her retail business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

B. is from the village of Sinayawan, Valencia. She is 68 years old, married and has eight adult-aged children. To make a living, Antonieta owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector where she raises livestock. While not serving as the sole means for generating revenue, Antonieta also raises pigs for sale. Antonieta has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Antonieta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Antonieta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. Antonieta is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP of which she hopes to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the near future. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Antonieta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

With her history thus far as an entrepreneur, it will be exciting to watch how her business grow and prosper in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is from the village of Lilo-an, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental. She is 39 years old. Hazel is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Hazel operates a family member's business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling baked foods in the local community. Hazel has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Hazel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hazel is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the first loan taken out by Hazel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Alimardon's wife milks the cows twice per day, in the mornings and evenings, and uses some of the milk to make butter, cottage cheese, kefir and heavy cream.  Alimardon's mother sells unused part of the milk and dairy products at a market every morning.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlimardon started his animal husbandry business 5 years ago.   He bought two sheep and a cow, raised them and sold them at a market.  Using the profits he received from the sale, he bought lambs and a calf, and his quantity of lambs now consisted of 4 heads.  And he has been doing so for 5 years already.  Alimardon plans to increase the quantity of his livestock by breeding it.

She is married and is a caring mother of her child, named Gulbahor.  Gulshan takes care of livestock at home; this is the primary source of income in their family.  A cow gives up to 10 liters of milk, which Gulshan processes.  She wants to purchase an additional cow in order to obtain more liters of milk and make dairy products from it for sale.

G. is from the city of Dipolog.

While it is not her only means for generating revenue, the service of rice milling and trading to local community is Leticia's main source of income. She has been engaged in the business for over 15 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Letecia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Letecia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Presently, Letecia is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be her 6th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to further improve and expand her services business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is from the village of Barangay Poblacion, Iligan City. She is 32 years old. Rotchel is married to Jezer and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Rotchel owns & operates a food stall (school canteen). While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the school. Rotchel has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, Rotchel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rotchel is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rotchel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to the supplement income of her family and to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Samdan is 34 years old and lives with her husband and two children in the Baganuur district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her two children are both small and stay home. Her husband works at Zamiin Uud, a border town with Ereen, China&#8212;the busiest and largest border with China. As her husband works full-time in Zamiin Uud, he is rarely at home. That's why she decided to pursue a small business by herself, instead of solely depending on her husband's salary. In 2005, she rented a small space and ran a small teashop. However, due to high rent, she decided to exit the teashop business. In 2009, she acquired a license to become an official distributor for a Russian company that sells health products extracted from bees' honey. Since she is the only one with the license in her town, she hopes to do well with the business. Since the start a few months earlier, her sales of health products have been doing considerably well. She says that she is working hard to introduce the honey products to locals and needs a personal computer to make marketing materials and purchase products online. She requests a loan to purchase a computer with Internet capabilities, with which she can do her own less costly marketing and order her products online.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\nFounded in 1998, XacBank is a community development bank and microfinance institution in Mongolia, and is headquartered in Ulaanbaatar.

Lyubov is 51. She and her husband work at school. All their children live separately. Two sons are in Russia, while other two sons work as drivers, and their daughter works at school. Lyubov needs a loan to buy a new fridge. \r\n\r\nAinakan is divorced; she raised three children. She works as a tailor, receiving orders for manufactured or ready-made garments. She then distributes products to clothing stores. This was her friend\u2019s suggestion. Now she feels ready to try cattle-raising and therefore needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nNazgul is a mother of four children. She makes a living by selling hay and milk. What she earns is not sufficient, so she wants to obtain a loan to send her daughter to work in Russia, so that her daughter can help her mother financially.   \r\n\r\nJipargul is 50. She is divorced and has one daughter. She makes a living by selling hay. Jipargul needs a loan to prepare her daughter\u2019s dowry.  \r\n\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Mutalib has been dedicated to the business of cattle ranching for the last 10 years. This business requires a lot of dedication for the fact that it demands a lot of effort to carry out the breeding. This is also true due to the fact that it requires the strict control of every one of the animals, while at the same time feeding and caring for those that are older. It is necessary to emphasize that through this business Mutalib is able to maintain his spouse and his 4 children. It is because of this he is soliciting a loan through IMON International. The credit will allow him to buy more animals, which he will raise and sell in the market. Mutalib has gained a reputation for responsibility with his financial obligations and for keeping his word. We are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tajikistan:<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mukaram is divorced and has three children. After her husband left the family, Mukaram was forced to find ways to provide for her family.

She rented a large shipping container at the local city market and purchased coats, jackets and other winter clothing to offer for sale. \r\n\r\n<P>Mukaram has now been in business for 9 years, working hard to meet the needs of her customers. She always makes her buyers feel welcome as she gives each one her full attention and serves them politely and with respect. Her reasonable prices and variety of inventory appeal to many modest clients.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Mukaram has promptly repaid all 6 loans she has received from IMON International. She understands the value of lending services that have helped her business grow and become self-sustainable. Mukaram is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni to increase her retail inventory. She is planning to purchase a variety of clothing that will be both durable and practical for a variety of customers. Having an assortment of inventory at exceptional prices will meet customer demand and draw many potential new clients to her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She currently sells a range of men\u2019s shirts at the large central market in Tursunzde. Fotima has a reputation for treating customers with care and kindness, qualities that set her apart from many other businesses that often lack good customer service. Fotima has also proven to be a great client with IMON International, having successfully repaid 6 loans. She has requested a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase new inventory and continue developing her business. \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is why he is asking for a loan to realize his plans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":356734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy mobile phones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Negmat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":124076,"name":"Makhsuda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a 38-year-old married mother of two children. Her children are ages 15 and 19.\r\n \r\nRita started her own clothing business six years ago to sell things like vitenge and kanga (fabrics). The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Rita works 12 hours a day and earns a monthly profit of approximately 200,000 Tanzania Shillings (about $152).\r\n\r\nThis is Rita\u2019s first loan from BRAC Tanzania. She has requested 200,000 Tsh in order to buy more vitenge and kanga. With the additional profit she gains from the use of this loan, Rita hopes to buy even more vitenge and kanga. \r\n\r\nBenadeta, another member of the borrower group, has requested 150,000 Tsh in

She began to sell peanuts, cookies, and grilled manioc with a initial capital of US $10. Her business prospered thanks to reinvested income, good management, and her remarkable courage. <P>\r\n\r\nBibi managed to maintain her clientele for more than a decade in her neighborhood located in the east of Kinshasa. In 2008, she decided to join one of the groups of IMF HOPE RDC, a group called \u00ab Manas\u00e9 Plus \u00bb in order to get an ongoing series of loans which will allow her to make her dream come true--to one day open a \"cold store\" or an electrical parts store.<P>\r\n\r\n She has already received 4 loans from HOPE that she has reimbursed correctly. The next loan will allow her to buy a mill to make the peanuts into peanut butter with the intention of diversifying her business which is generating presently a profit of US$ 20 per week. <P>\r\n\r\n Bibi is 52, married and the mother of 2 children, 15 and 16. Both are enrolled in secondary school. Besides these two children, she also takes care of two other children who are orphans--a nephew and a niece of hers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva
