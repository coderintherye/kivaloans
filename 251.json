C. is 18 years old and lives at home with her mother and two younger sisters.  Her father passed away 3 years ago and since then it is practically her that takes care of the chicharroneria (a place where they serve plates of pork that are served fried in a large frying pan, traditional of Cochabamba).  When her sisters return from school, they help out with the business.\r\n\r\nShirley lives in the area called \"El Castillo\" in Cochabamba.  The chicharroneria is located in their home where they serve food every day, but in larger quantities on Saturday and Sunday.  The chicharroneria is famous in the area because it has been around for a very long time and the food has a reputation for good quality.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used for the purchase of better kitchen equipment since the current equipment is very old and almost obsolete.  With better kitchen equipment, they will be able to increase the amount of pork they sell, increase their earnings, and consequently improve their quality of life.  Shirley hopes to be able get another loan in the future to improve the infrastructure of the chicharroneria and be able to give better attention to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

A. is 31 years old.  She has 3 daughters, the oldest is 15 years old, the second oldest is 11, and the youngest is 9.  The three children attend the school in the area and receive very good grades because they say they enjoy learning.  They help take care of the cows in the afternoons after school.\r\n\r\nVirginia lives in the Monte Canto zone in Cochabamba, and in her house is where she has her milking cow who produces milk.  All the milk that is produced is delivered daily to a local company that manufactures all types of dairy products.  Her husband passed away less than 2 years ago, and he was the one who worked with the milking cow.  But when he passed, she and her daughters had to start taking care of the cows.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase another milking cow in order to increase the milk production that they have, and that way they will increase their earnings and consequently their quality of life.  Virginia hopes to be able to increase her earnings to the point when she can hire someone to help take care of the cows, so she does not have to depend on her daughters.  This way they can dedicate more time studying and succeeding in school with good grades, attend a university, and complete the dream of her husband.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

husband could generate made life very hard of Basiliana and her family. When a friend invited her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, she was very apprehensive because she did not want to be in debt, but she was determined to help her family, so with the agreement of her husband, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and with her first loan she started a small general store and to make sure that she could pay back her loan she went around her community selling specialty goods house to house. The business nets around PHP1,600.00 ($33) per month, but is able to feed her family.\r\n\r\nShe has used subsequent loans to slowly but steadily build her business. Now on her 11th loan cycle, the PHP 15,000 she is borrowing will allow her to widen the variety of goods that she could sell in her store. She continues to strive hard to provide for her family and dreams that all her children will have a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Since she is a single mother and lives with her only son, she is committed to work very hard to provide him with the best. \r\n\r\nShe has been selling cosmetics since a very young age and has always sought to do the best she can. This determination reflects in the responsibilities that she assumes in the cosmetics line. For that reason she is in charge of a group of young girls to whom she gives guidance on the best way to achieve their sales objectives. She performs this activity throughout the day, always trying to take a break to be with her son. Her greatest difficulty is the supervision time in the evening when she must check the placed orders. Now Hortencia plans to open a store in her home, where she will install showcases to display her products and increase her income without leaving her home.\r\n\t\r\nThe six loans that she has had with Microfinanzas Prisma have enabled her to increase her income, but above all they have helped her to improve her work as an active member of her community bank, which was formed three years ago. Hortencia will invest the 1800 nuevos soles of her loan in showcases to place her merchandise and in more cosmetics. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":359057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy showcases","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":164.8},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":172.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":184.96},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":187.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":199.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":209.8},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":216.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":227.64},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":236.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.93},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.65},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.49},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.93,"local_amount":164.8,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":166.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641669,"comment":null},{"amount":57.49,"local_amount":172.46,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":173.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081109,"comment":null},{"amount":61.65,"local_amount":184.96,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":186.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997259,"comment":null},{"amount":62.39,"local_amount":187.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":188.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842603,"comment":null},{"amount":174.07,"local_amount":522.22,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":526.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734179,"comment":null},{"amount":34.63,"local_amount":103.9,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959569,"comment":null},{"amount":75.88,"local_amount":227.64,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":229.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992358,"comment":null},{"amount":78.96,"local_amount":236.87,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":238.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717190,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-19T18:55:25Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":125183,"name":"Felicita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"      La se\u00f1ora Felicita V. ya ha tenido dos cr\u00e9ditos con KIVA los cuales a pagado puntual mente y est\u00e1 muy agradecida por su gran ayuda que le han brindado con estos pr\u00e9stamos, con los cuales a surtido y remodelado su negocio.   \nEso le ha permitido tener un mayor ingreso y as\u00ed poder ayudar a su esposo con los gastos de la familia.\nEsta solicitando un tercer cr\u00e9dito para poder surtir su negocio de mercanc\u00eda, como es de l\u00e1cteos, productos congelados y verduras.

She rejoined in July of 2006, so that she could get a loan to raise pigs to augment their family income. She buys the piglets, feeds and fattens them for several months and then sells them. This adds PHP 4,000 ($83) to her family's monthly income.\r\n\r\nThe income she earns from raising pigs in her backyard for the last 3 years has helped her family a lot especially with 7 children still going to school. This is why Nieva is committed to continue and expand with this activity so that she could increase her income potential.\r\n\r\nThe PHP 18,000 she is borrowing will allow her to buy more piglets and feed than her previous loan which she ably paid off because of the weekly easy-payment scheme.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

A. is from the village of Labuyo, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is 40 years old. Juvy is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Juvy owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Juvy has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juvy joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juvy is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Juvy from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

P. is from the village of Calaca-an. She is 26 years old. Mezeil is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mezeil owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising ducks for sale. Mezeil is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Mezeil joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mezeil has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Mezeil is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Mezeil from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Calaca-an. She is 50 years old. Marivic is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Marivic owns & operates a business providing power-sawing services to local community members. Marivic has been engaged in her business for over 35 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2002, Marivic joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marivic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service. Marivic is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Marivic from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nIn the photo, Marivic is shown supervising one of her workers operating a power-saw. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They mostly farmed their small landholding which was very dependent on the whims of nature. It was not until Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 that they were able to really experience more stability in their financial situation. She used her first cycle loan to start a \"Sari-sari\" store - the local version of a general store where everyone can buy anything and everything that has a demand within the area - from foodstuff like canned and baked goods to charcoal and kerosene gas for fuel and even some hardware and farm implements. She also went into food vending and even raised a few heads of cattle over the years.\r\n\r\nShe used her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon to buy ducklings to raise. It proved to be a good venture to pursue that she invested most of her subsequent loans to this activity, and it now earns her family an additional PHP 2,000.00 per month. Erlinda's last loan of PHP 17,000 was paid off on time, and now she is borrowing PHP 22,000.00 for her 16th cycle loan to purchase more ducklings to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nRaising ducks has not only proved to be a profitable activity for Erlinda and her family, the ducks are also very eco-friendly: they provide natural pest control by eating the insects and other pests in the fields, leave organic fertilizer and tamp down the weeds in the rice fields where they feed. \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes that in the future, the business ventures that she and her husband started will be able to support the families of their children, and make life more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

year old Erlinda Monta\u00f1o is married with 4 children aged 8, 10, 16 and 17. They live in the village of Pandan, in the town of Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She is borrowing PHP 12,000.00 to buy fertilizer for the farm that she and her husband plant with sugarcane and rice, to supplement their family income and provide for their young family. \r\n\r\nErlinda is very grateful that a friend invited her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006, because the 7 loans she availed in the span of 3 years has had a great impact on their family. She used her first loan to start a \"Sari-sari\" store where she sold a wide variety of goods and products that were in demand in her neighborhood including the usual staples like rice, bread, salt and other stuff like laundry soap, shampoo, cooking oil, even charcoal and other fuel. \r\n\r\nWith 4 children in school, the Monta\u00f1o family needed a supplementary source of income. So Erlinda and her husband decided to diversify into rice and cane farming. Subsequent loans and profits from her store allowed them to buy a Carabao that they use to plow their cane and rice fields. The farm adds approximately PHP 2,000.00 per month to their family income.\r\n\r\nErlinda hopes that with diligence and continued determination, she will be able to raise her family to adulthood and provide a comfortable life for them.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture of Erlinda was taken inside Center No 96 of NWTF-Project Dungganon La Castellana Branch. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

L. hails from the beautiful city of Antipolo, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. She is 35 years old and the mother to four. All of her kids are all in the elementary grades except the youngest, who is four years old. Her husband, Rogelio, is 39 and is a vendor and her business partner.\r\n\r\nLife was not easy for Marita. She was challenged by the miserable condition of their lives to strive hard and search for a greener living. In 2003, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with the hope of bringing light to her family. On her previous loans, she prudently invested those in doormat making. But it is quite laborious and time consuming.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Marita opted to venture in fish-ball vending which is in demand by kids and also by the people in the community, especially during the afternoon. She observed that fish-ball vending is more profitable, and so she considered it as their primary business.\r\n\r\nNow, Marita has applied for a loan of 30,000 pesos as additional capital for her business, to improve her cart and some will go to her secondary business of doormat making.\r\n\r\nMarita is positive and hopeful that, if coupled with industry, their business will bring them great profit so that they can save and be able to send their children to school, enabling them to find jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":359530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To

Her family lives in a \"ger\" (yurt) district in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Both of her children go to the local elementary school. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, she started a retail business selling costume jewelry, such as earrings, necklaces, and rings, for teenage girls. Her stall is near the central door of the Narantuul market, the biggest four-season outdoor market in the capital city. Because of its location, at least 10% of market visitors stop by her stall, and most of them purchase some of the small items that she sells. Once or twice a year, Otgonbat goes to Ereen, a city on the Mongolian-Chinese border, to purchase more small accessories at wholesale prices. To save travel expenses, she asks her friends who go to Ereen to buy goods for her. \r\n\r\nWith the profits from her business, her husband has built a house on the plot of land they own. Otgonbat says, \"Because my husband and I are very busy, we cannot take good care of our children. Thus, we are planning to hire a saleswoman for our business. I hope, then, that we can spend more time with our children.\" \r\n\r\nOtgonbat is requesting a loan to purchase goods for her small business.

I. is from the village of Panduma, Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 41 years old. Apao is separated from her spouse and has 1 infant-aged child. To make a living, Apao owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from buying and selling fish in the local community. Apao has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Apao joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Apao has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fish to sell. Apao is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Apao from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.`"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":359158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

S. is from the village of Danao. She is 26 years old. Elsie is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Elsie owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Elsie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 13,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elsie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Elsie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A. is from the village of Danao. She is 46 years old. Nilda is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Nilda operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Nilda has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos (about $208) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Nilda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nilda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Nilda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Nilda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Y. is from the village of Danao. She is 40 years old. Flor is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Flor operates a fishing business, harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Flor has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (about $104) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Flor joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flor has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Flor is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Flor from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Usocan. She is 52 years old. Teresita is married and has two adult children. Teresita operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 2,800 Philippine pesos (about $58) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Teresita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Teresita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Although she receives a monthly pension from her late husband, she is eager to continue with this business as it generates additional income for the family and as she can employ her neighbors in her \u201cnipa\u201d forming (paod) business. She joined PMPC in February 2009 and has had a good credit record. She is now applying for a loan of PHP 50,000 as additional capital for her existing business. She plans to expand her business to other municipalities and cities near Misamis Occidental and Zamboanga Del Sur."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":359137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Additional capital for her \"Nipa\" buying and selling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dupol, Bonifacio, Mis.

C. is from the village of Campo 5, Ramon Magsaysay, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 59 years old. Yeyen is married. To make a living, Yeyen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector selling personal home products. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling personal home products to tourists and local community members. Yeyen is just starting this business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Yeyen joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yeyen successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Yeyen is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Yeyen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She learned how to keep cattle. Now she is divorced and the sole supporter of her family.  Her family consists of her 55 year old disabled sister and 18 year old son, a college student. \r\n<p>\r\nShe makes living by selling milk but her income is not sufficient to meet her family's needs. Her current income is just thirty five dollars. \r\n<p>\r\nDuring fifteen years of keeping cattle, she has managed to repair her house and pay for her son\u2019s college education. \r\n<p>\r\nCholpon needs a loan to buy hay for her cattle. At this time of year, hay prices are low.  She is planning to grow wheat and saving money to buy a house for her son.   \r\n<p>\r\nKulpira, Mars and Maikul are Cholpon\u2019s partners. Kulpira is a 49 year old widower. She has one daughter and a grandson. Except for working in a kindergarten, she farms land she inherited after her husband\u2019s death.  She needs a loan to pay for grass. She wants to keep part of her supply for winter time and sell the rest. \r\n<p>\r\nMars is 31.  He sells foodstuffs: alcoholic drinks, bread, detergents, etc. His monthly income is $165. He understands that as his children grow up, he needs to expand his business to make more profits. A loan would let him purchase more goods and increase turnover. \r\n<p>\r\nMaikul is a widow.  She is a mother of three children. For the last 15 years she has been a school teacher. Besides that, she sells milk and rears her grandchild.  She earns $70 a month.  She needs a loan to pay for hay cutting and transportation expenses.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhere Did This Loan Come From?\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Gairat has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and two children in their home.\r\n\r\nAfter purchasing his cattle, Gairat provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Gairat sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. His wife (pictured) helps him with taking care of and feeding his animals.\r\n\r\nCurrently Gairat needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of 3,000 Somoni. He thanks Kiva for the support that it presents to small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Normat is a humble man who earns a living in the cattle-farming business. He is the father of three children, who motivate him to work harder every day to be able to meet their needs. It is important to note that this business requires a lot of physical work, mainly because he needs to transport the animals from one point to another, crossing long distances under the exposure of the sun. This can cause illnesses and can weaken the body. Nonetheless, Normat continues to work hard and has now come to IMON International to obtain the loan that will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell in his area.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by milking her cows and selling 15 liters of milk daily. Her husband, apart from helping her look after cows, works as a plumber. She has two children, a little son and a daughter. Six years ago, Zamira and her husband started dealing with real estate. After successfully selling some of their property, they bought a cow and a calf. They took a risk to put in $625, which was quite a large sum of money at that time. Now, they have turned it into a monthly income of $100. By means of saving money, they have obtained some necessary equipment for her husband\u2019s work and a car.\r\n\r\nZamira and her husband need a loan to buy another cow. This would enable them breed their cattle and increase its population. \r\n\r\n\"Everything we do, we do for the sake of our children. Our son is growing up. Very soon, he will be going to school. So we need to purchase everything needed for his education, including stationary and (a) school uniform,\" says Zamira.\r\n\r\nTaalaibek, Suyorbubu and Kayir are in the same group with Zamira. Taalaibek is 40. He is married and has three children. Taalaibek provides for his family by collecting milk from local villagers and producing milk products. He sells these products in the city of Alma Ata. He needs a loan to purchase sheep and cows and to increase turnover. \r\n\r\nKayir is 44. She sells yogurt that she produces from her cow\u2019s milk, or from milk that she buys from other villagers. She urgently needs a new fridge to put the milk products in since the old one cannot contain all of her products. She cannot buy a fridge unless she obtains a loan. \r\n\r\nSuyorbubu is a housewife. She keeps a cow and sells milk. Some years ago she obtained a loan and bought a car. Since then, by selling milk she has managed to save enough money to buy new furniture for her son. She wants to obtain a loan to purchase calves and feed for them. After fattening them up, she is going to resell them. \r\n\r\n\"Even though raising livestock requires certain amount of efforts, it is not that troublesome. In a rural area like ours, it is the most convenient business,\" says Suyorbubu with enthusiasm.  \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the three Ps concept: people (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the planet (taking care of the environment).

She also bought several piglets to raise and sell. This side business earns her an additional PHP 1,500.00 per month.\r\n\r\nNow on her 9th loan cycle, Mary Cris wants to borrow PHP 7,000.00 to buy cattle to raise and sell to supplement her family income. \r\n\r\nMary Cris continues to explore other business opportunities in the hope that all these help support her growing family's financial needs. With 3 teen-age kids and 3 youngsters, Mary Cris also prayes that her business activities will inspire the entrepreneurial spirit in her children so that they will grow up knowing that they have the power to become independent and be financially stable if they're willing to work hard.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Since her adolescence, she has followed in her mother's footsteps with whom she used to go out to sell different types of garments, but more than anything sports garments which are in high demand in her country because of the strong deep-rooted football culture, in addition to shoes for walking or doing exercise.\r\n\r\nShe gets up very early, prepares her daughter to leave for school, prepares food for lunch and then leaves on the bus to her place of sales that she has had for 21 years, a sales stand in the heart of the Municipal Market #4, the most busy market of the capital city, between the streets of Republica de Colombia and Battillana, in front of a well-known import business, Andrade Imports.\r\n\r\nMiguela has Champion shoes for men of all sizes from size 36 to 44, and for women from size 34 to 40, and for children, sizes for newborns all the way up to those for adolescents of 14 or 15 years old. All of the other vendors like her a lot because she is a very friendly, sacrificed and accommodating woman. Miguela takes a liking to the clients from when they approach her, and she tries to find what they are looking for. She possesses the patience necessary for them to try on the garments and take what they desire home with them. She would use the loan to increase the amount of shoes she has in stock.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva

She is 40 years old, married, and the mother of 3 children with ages between 5 and 14 years old.  She went to school through the 6th grade at the secondary school of Tsalala.  She stopped because of the civil war that ended in 1992.  She lives with her spouse in their own home, and she works for the government in the real estate area.\r\n\r\nShe was married 21 years ago, and 6 years ago she began her business (selling products of primary necessity).  She sells a lot of fish which she buys in the city of Maputo (about 9km away) for 1,050MT per box and sells for 1,500MT.  She is able to earn 400MT daily.  Some times she has been able to save through a traditional savings schedule composed of a group of about 10 ladies.\r\n\r\nShe is not responsible for any more people.  She has never had a loan through other institutions, and this is her 4th loan with Hluvuku-Adsema in the amount of 10,000MT.  She will use it to buy products of primary necessity.  The first loans were all used for the business, 5,500MT, 6,500MT, and 6,000MT respectively.\r\n\r\nShe came to know Hluvuku through her neighbor who is also a client.  She hopes to see her business continually grow and deposit the increased receipts in the bank, in an account she will open soon.  She plans on paying back her loan to be able to access more loans to fulfill her dream of constructing a commercial establishment with conventional materials.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She\u00b4s been working in Bananalandia as a weeder for over two years with a monthly salary of  2.000,00MT.\r\n\r\nBesides formal employment, Ilda has been doing her own business for over 5 years.\r\nShe sells pots (she buys each of them for 130,00MT and sells them for 230,00MT). This is how she gets to save a bit of money for the difficult times.\r\n\r\nShe heard about  Hluvuku-Adsema through some friends who were the first ones to request loans from Hluvuku. \r\nThis is her third credit of 10.000,00MT to purchase more pots and other products for resale. Her other two credits were of  2.000,00MT and 5.000,00MT, respectively, for the same activity.\r\n\r\nShe has not had a problem doing her business, despite being employed, she manages to harmonize her time very well. She hopes to see her business grow and after repaying this loan she expects to requests other loans to build her home with conventional building materials.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

I work with all local businesses and I like to help grow the local economy.\u201d\n\nWilliam is the owner of Gentle Parking, a parking lot management company located in San Francisco, CA. After working in the parking services industry for over ten years, William was excited to start his own business and, in just one year, is already expanding by opening a new lot location. He currently has six employees and hopes to continue providing jobs to the community by growing his business. \n\nWilliam\u2019s credit was severely affected by the recent economic downturn, and finding financing for his business has been nearly impossible.

This is why she is requesting a loan and will buy everything she needs to invest in her business.  She will repay the loan with the income she generates from the merchandise she plans to acquire.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She used her first loan to invest in a small grocery shop, and although she had her shop, she also decided to support her husband in his timber business.  Alith's husband has worked with timber for 10 years.  Alith supported him financially with this business, and continues to do so with her loans from Manuela Ramos.  Together, Alith and her husband are progressing financially for the good of their family.

C. Jr., 12 years old, studies in elementary school. Elvira\u2019s family is happily living in the simple village of Gamis Saguday, Quirino. \r\n\r\nElvira makes preserved flowers out of dried leaves. She sells her product within their village and sometimes goes to sell in other villages so that they can generate an increased income. She is thankful that, through the income generated from the business, she is able to send her three children to school. According to Elvira, she needs increased capital to improve the unique preserved flower product business that she makes. In this regard, she is requesting to borrow a loan amounting to PHP5,000 as additional working capital. This will help to sustain her flower making activity and to make it known and popular to other municipalities and even nationwide. She hopes that her membership to Kiva will be a good start towards the progress of her business.

Z. is optimistic that, in the near future, she can cut the tie of poverty that hinders her way and her family to success. She is 40 years old and married to Alfredo, 47 years old. She has four children. She lives in the beautiful town of Morong, Rizal province, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nLife was not easy for Emerita. She needs to have her own income to sustain the needs of her family. In 2003, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines with a hope of having access to capital for her business. Her previous loans were used as additional capital for her sewing business. A portion of those loans were used as additional capital for her secondary business in food vending. Now, on her 8th loan, she proposes the amount of 35,000 pesos as additional capital for her sewing business. This loan will be used to purchase three high-speed sewing machines and thread.\r\n\r\nEmerita is looking forward to expanding her business by hiring a labor team, considering the demands of the shop. With the proceeds she receives, she is hopeful to have a dress shop of her own. She hopes that she can help her neighbors by providing job opportunities. She will be able to send all her children to school with the proceeds of her

is 25 years old and she manages a cell phone shop in the city of Santiago. She is married to Jerry B., her partner in managing the business. The couple is blessed with two children: Jaybie - 6 years old and Zyra Mae - 4 years old. They are presently living at Barangay Garit Norte in Echague, Isabela. Floribel has been operating her business for six years now. In fact, her cellphone shop is doing well and she now has two branches, in two towns.\r\n<P>\r\nHowever, she still wants to do her best to make her business more successful and to become the leading cell phone shop in the region. She believes that her faith in God and her patience will make her business keep growing. Now that a Kiva loan is possible, Floribel wants to apply for an initial loan of 30,000 Philippine pesos. This amount will be a big help in the progress of her cell phone center. She will buy more accessories to sell, including cell phone spare parts, to use in their cell phone repair business.\r\n<P>\r\nFloribel also says, if others can, why can\u2019t I? She is hoping that she can improve her cell shop and that she will be able to achieve success in life.

O. is a hardworking vendor who lives simply in the village of Santos Quezon, Isabela. She is married to Renato O., who is a farmer. Their major livelihood in the village is agriculture. Rice, vegetables and bananas are their main products that they produce every year. To help her husband earn a daily income, Violeta ventured into selling their produce. She sells in the market and sometimes in their neighborhood. When her products do not sell in the market, she often sells them to her neighbors in the village at a cheaper price. She enjoys her business and tries her best to improve it.  \r\n\r\nWith the opportunity brought by Kiva lenders, Violeta is encouraged to apply for a loan of  PHP 12,000 that she will use as additional capital for her vending business. She will then able to support small vegetable farmers in their village by selling their fruit and vegetable products in the market and to local villagers. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that Kiva lenders will pay attention to her business concerns and ambitions, not only for herself, but also for her fellow man.

L. hails from the mountainous city of Antipolo, Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is full of hope that she can raise her family out of poverty. She is 44 years old and is married to Rogelio, her business partner. They have been blessed with six children. Her eldest son is 24 years old and the youngest is a 4-year-old boy.\r\n\r\nHer greatest aspiration in life is to provide a decent life for her children. In 2000, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with a bagful of hope to step out from under the burden of poverty. She invested some of her previous loans in the raising of hogs, but years later, she opted to shift her business to transportation with a tricycle and rickshaw.\r\n\r\nThe business went smoothly and brought them enough profit, because the tricycle transportation is in demand in the city. Now on her 14th loan, she proposes the amount of 20,000 pesos. With it, she will renew her business license and pay for tires and other maintenance for the tricycle. She will use part of her loan as capital for her secondary resale business.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA, she can achieve her dreams of sending her children to school and expanding her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":360437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

L. is the 47-year-old manager of her own business. She is full of industry and hard work, and is aiming to pull her family out of poverty. She is married to Teodoro, who is 53 years old and her business partner. She is the mother of seven children, three of whom are still of underage and dependent on her. She lives in Antipolo City, Rizal Province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with a bagful of dreams to alleviate the poor conditions of her family. Her previous loans were carefully spent on her sari-sari (variety) and food store. The business went well and smoothly. She has many regular customers and the business has brought good proceeds that she can use for her family's needs.\r\n\r\nNow on her 15th loan, she proposes the amount of 45,000 pesos to pay for sacks of rice, charcoal, feed, fresh pork, and other groceries for her store. She is positive that her business will grow large and bring her income so she can save for the future of her younger children. She is also looking forward to expanding her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":360449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

D. is 47 years old, the same age as her husband, Felix. The couple have three children, ages 21 to 26. Their eldest child is a computer programming graduate and the other two are college undergraduates who are working as laborers.\r\n\r\nLydia, her husband, and their children had been living in Manila. Lydia's husband worked in a manufacturing shop that made household furniture from native materials, such as ratan. She sold relief goods, such as clothing, shoes, and bags, to people in their village. Felix received only a small profit from his output despite the hard work it entailed. Lydia's business was unstable because she did not have sufficient business capital. Because Lydia and Felix felt that they could not afford to live in Manila with its high standard of living and still send all of their children to college, they decided to return to their own province in Antique.\r\n\r\nBecause Felix had experience in furniture-making, enhanced by years of working in Manila, he and Lydia thought of opening their own furniture shop in the Province. Lydia agreed to her husband's idea and she was delighted once again, because she can have still her own business buying and selling relief goods while partnering with her husband in the furniture business. A small amount of savings and a loan from ASHI enabled Lydia and her husband open a shop in their house in Patria, Pandan. They hired one of Felix coworkers from Manila to work with them. \r\n\r\nLydia believes that, someday, her loan from ASHI will make their business successful because she maintains an excellent record of repayment and attendance at center meetings. Her attitude is as fine as their manufactured furniture, which attracts potential customers. Some day, she wishes that their business will grow and, more importantly, that it will generate employment in the community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":360457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

A. hails from the beautiful city of Antipolo, Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is 39 years old and  is determined and full of faith, as mother of a daughter, to get out of poverty. She is married to Renaldo, who is a 39-year-old driver.\r\n\r\nWith her dream to step out of poverty, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2007. Her previous loans were used as capital for her business, in which she sells live chickens and chicken feathers. The live chickens are used as raw material for fried chicken. The feathers are used for decorations and costumes, and are in demand in dress shops and in the market.\r\n\r\nThe business went well and brought her enough income to sustain her family's needs. Now on her 4th loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 pesos as additional capital for reselling live chickens and chicken feathers.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that, with her business, she will be able to achieve her dream of sending her only child to school and be able to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":360466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"As

is a young mother to two kids. She is married to Chito, 27 years old and a rickshaw driver. Even with her young age, she opened her eyes to a much wider perspective in life. She dreams of pulling her family out of poverty. She lives in Antipoly City, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAs a woman of hope, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2005. While her husband is engaged with driving a rickshaw, she thinks of a business which can help her husband in earning money. Considering that she has young children, she decided to open a Sari-sari Store (General Store) in their house. The business ran well and her neighbors became her regular customers.\r\n\r\nNow on her 6th loan, she is requesting 20,000 pesos as additional capital for her store. The loan will be used to pay for cases of soft drinks, liquors, rice, charcoal and many other groceries for the store.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that with her growing business, she will be able to save for the future of her children, especially the education expenses, and hopeful of expanding her

S. is a 40-year-old woman who has been raising her 12-year-old twins all by herself after her separation from her husband. She and her children live in Patria, Pandan in the province of Antique. Though their village is far from the market and the main municipality, Emeline never allowed these circumstances to hinder her from earning money. She had been selling a variety of cooked food in her neighborhood, even reaching houses farther away in their village. She is used to walking through the rough and narrow road covered with trees to make sure that when she comes back home, she brings money that the children need for school. Neither rain, the heat of the sun, nor tiredness is an excuse for her to stop her from what she has been doing.\r\n\r\nEmeline's family owns a small land that can be used in planting rice. However, this land has not been productive because there was no business capital to start with. The vision of profiting from this kind of business made her join ASHI and take a loan. From then on, her farming business was born and with the help of her family, she tries to maintain it together with her food selling business.\r\n\r\nHaving her family, her own children, and ASHI, Emeline is secure for she can have her own business, which can enable her to send all of her children to college and give them a better life.

B. is from the village of Lantay, Valencia City Bukidnon. She is 52 years old. Teresita is married and has 9 school-aged children. To make a living, Teresita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Teresita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional business capital. Teresita is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Teresita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and supplement her income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Lantay, Valencia Bukidnon. She is 33 years old. Elenita is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Elenita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Elenita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elenita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. Elenita is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elenita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and supplement her income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
