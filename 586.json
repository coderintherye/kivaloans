His wife helps him primarily with sales, but on a schedule that is not detrimental to raising their children.  \r\n  \r\nOver time, he has seen that the business is profitable because his dish is very tasty and in high demand.  This allows him to plan for the future and see better options for his business.  This is his first loan with MFP; he is very enthusiastic to see that he has joined a group of people who are united and financially responsible with their loans.  This gives him confidence, and he commits to making his repayments on time.

Evelyn B., 38, does just that. Evelyn is only a high school graduate, but right now she manages her own micro-business. She is married to a construction worker, Joevil, and mother to her three children, who are all studying at a public high school nearby.  Together, they live in Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nEvelyn runs her own sari-sari (variety) store, located in an extension of their house. Every day, she observes the buying patterns of her customers and notes their preferences in terms of the type of item they buy, the price and the brand. She sees to it that her customers get what they desire. She also operates a food stall where she offers food items among her local community. Monthly, Evelyn earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan.  She intends to meet the demands of her customers.  As needed, she will buy more stocks of rice, soft drinks and other grocery items.  She also will use part of this loan to buy more raw ingredients needed for her food stall.\r\n\r\nEvelyn acknowledges that no challenge is too hard to deal with. She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome and uphold the future of both her children and her business. She dreams of making her sari-sari store grow.

Together, they live in Fairview, Quezon City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nHelen operates an electric repair shop.  She has been in this kind of business for quite some time now.  She hires a repairman to do what is needed for every item their customers bring to their shop.  These include household appliances like washing machines, electric fans, and televisions, among others.  Serving her local community, she earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 PHP per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan.  She intends to use this loan to pay for spare parts needed for the repair of electric items.  Helen believes that through this loan, she will be able to accommodate the needs of her clients that would eventually create income for her business.\r\n\r\nHelen prays for good health and success for her business.  She desires that her children will be able to finish their college education and become financially stable someday.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she reads.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":758786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for spare parts needed for electrics repair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-26T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2303.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123640,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2303.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195049,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2879.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474098,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1152.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636879,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-26T17:15:55Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":293748,"name":"Pil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pil M., 59, sells grocery items in front of a garment factory in the Kampong Chhnang province.

For this purpose, he needs to take a loan of 1500$ USD. He intends to purchase spare parts for the repairing of his truck. Shokir thanks everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan with accuracy.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Erlinda C., 66, does just that. Erlinda is only an elementary school graduate but right now she manages her own micro business as she learns entrepreneurship as a community partner in CCT*. She is a widow, and takes care of her four children, who are all working.\r\n\r\nErlinda runs her own sari-sari (variety) store, located in the extension of their house. Everyday she observes the buying patterns of her customers and notes down their preferences in terms of the type of item they buy, the price, and the brand. She sees to it that her customers get what they deserve. Monthly, Erlinda earns Php11,000 on average.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan.  She intends to meet the demands of her customers.  As needed, she will buy more stocks of rice, soft drinks, and other grocery items. \r\n\r\nErlinda acknowledges that no challenges are too hard to deal with.  She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome, and  will uphold the future of both her children and her business. She dreams of making her sari-sari store grow.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Roswil T., 32, does just that. Roswil is only a high school graduate but right now she manages her own micro-business as she learns entrepreneurship as a community partner in CCT*. She is married to a vendor, Renato, and mothers her three children, two of whom are still studying in elementary school while the other one is not yet of school age. Together, they live in Brgy. Commonwealth, Quezon City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nRoswil takes the opportunity of selling turnips in her local community as summer is the best season for turnips in the Philippines. She buys these vegetables from wholesalers and retails the same ones with minimal mark up.  Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of around 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to purchase sacks of turnips to sell in her local community. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRoswil acknowledges that no challenges is too hard to deal with. She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome and uphold the future of both her children and her business. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she reads.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":759035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for sacks of turnips for selling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-27T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roswil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333.31,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1371.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123647,"comment":null},{"amount":126.66,"local_amount":5333.34,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5487.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195060,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6858.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474105,"comment":null},{"amount":126.66,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5487.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636886,"comment":null},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333.38,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1371.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005198,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-27T10:12:36Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":293926,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 35 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

children. She is 34 years old and makes a living by selling women's and children's clothes from her house. She has 13 years of experience in this line of work. She works in order to secure a respectable life for herself and for the members of her family. She wants them to have a good life and a good future. She wants to provide them with an education that will grant them a good future, as she is a mother and her biggest concern in life is her children. Furthermore, she is the one who provides for her children. She also has a particularly strong concern for her family because she is a divorced woman who must rely on herself to improve her and her children's lives. With a loan from al-Majmoua, she would like to pay for her children's school tuition fees so that they can continue their education.

She works selling clothes, and she has two years of experience in this line of work. She works hard since she is a caring mother and strives to provide a good education for her children as well as support them in all areas of life in general.

N. lives in the Kisaasi neighborhood in the city of Kampala, Uganda.  She is married and has 5 children, all of whom are in school.  She also takes care of additional family (in-laws).    \r\n\r\nSarah sells charcoal.  She has been in this business for 10 years, and she works 7 days a week. Sarah sells her products from home, at retail.  She also generates additional income through renting rooms and selling second-hand clothes.  \r\n\r\nSarah has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bags of charcoal.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

Ramila K., who is married and has three children aged 17, 13 and 5, established her cow-raising business in 2000.  Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family.  Ramila has already received and repaid four loans from Patan BPW, and used her most recent one to buy a young milk-giving cow.  In the future, Ramila plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

She first began renting a store from her sister-in-law, but the rent became very expensive and she had to step renting and opted instead to put the business in her home. She says that she asked for a loan to supply her store and buy bleach, canned chili peppers, soups, oil, soap, eggs, beans, sodas, candies, milk, etc. Bety, as she is known by her friends, goes to different stores in Zitacuaro to source her products where they give her good prices so that she can make a profit when she sells them. \r\n\r\nBeatriz is married to Juan Carolos, who is a Guaracha musician, and has two children - Cecilia, who is in primary school, and Carlos, who is 2.

She thanks you for your support. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50 USD.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

His parents taught him to work on the farm since he was a very young boy.  He is now a farmer and has 20 hectares of land where he grows cacao and coffee which are both native plants of the rainforest area of the Apur\u00edmac River Valley.  He has worked in this business for 25 years and he says that he likes it a lot.  He also has the support of his familiy, in addition to the laborers that he hires so that he can finish his sowing, weeding and harvesting quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat Aquiles most enjoys about his work is harvesting the fruit from his plants since that is when he feels that the months of hard work are providing him with their reward in the quality of the fruit.  He considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his products from the farm to the warehouses, which are located in the city of San Francisco and Quimbiri, as it is very heavy and difficult to transport.  Another difficulty is that he doesn't have enough money to pay in advance for the laborers who support him in his harvesting and weeding.  This is why he takes loans offered by MFP.\r\n\r\nRight now, Aquiles' priority is sowing his coffee and cacao plants since he has enough space for this.  This is his 12th loan from MFP and he feels that the loan money will help him a lot in making progress in his work.  Aquiles is very well liked by the other members of his community bank.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for thiee milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and fuel for fires and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Once he has harvested his produce, he sells it to traders who pay him very well for every kilogram of produce.\r\n\r\nBlas considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his produce from the farm to the warehouses which are located in the city of San Francisco.  This is where they offer him the best prices for his products.  Blas' main priority right now is to buy more coffee plants so that he expand his sown fields and increase his production which will, in turn, enable him to provide his family with good financial stability.\r\n\r\nThis is Blas' 12th loan from MFP and he is prepared to make all his repayments on time since he would like to be able to access another loan in the future.

C. P.  is 33 years old and a resident of Puerto Colombia, a town on the shores of the Carribbean. He lives there with his wife and 6 year old son, whom he dreams of seeing become a successful professional. Luis Alberto has a business in the neighborhood of El Porvenir in the city of Barranquilla, called \u201cTienda y Salsamentar\u00eda Surtiya Norte\u201d, where he sells products and ingredients for the preparation of fast food, such as sauces, cold cuts, cheese and disposable products. His main challenge is growing his capital to get discounts for paying upfront and having a higher volume of purchase. His goal in the future is to have another sales locale in the university corridor in the city of Barranquilla, and to buy a vehicle to fill delivery orders quickly. Luis Alberto deals with strong competition in his business and is able to respond successfully by offering quality products and services and competitive products. In this way, he maintains himself in the market and has an average profit margin of  20% with a 10 day inventory turnover.
