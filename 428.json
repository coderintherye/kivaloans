For this reason he is requesting this loan: it will be used to buy cement blocks, zinc sheets and wood in order to carry out his project.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emanuela Villa, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":568066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"To renovate his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-07-17T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermenegildo German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.96,"local_amount":937.8,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":939.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771193,"comment":null},{"amount":41.84,"local_amount":892.48,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":894.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172205087,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":896,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":897.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330775,"comment":null},{"amount":42.1,"local_amount":898.19,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":899.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465933,"comment":null},{"amount":41.95,"local_amount":894.88,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":896.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098062,"comment":null},{"amount":41.94,"local_amount":894.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":896.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348642,"comment":null},{"amount":41.91,"local_amount":894.13,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":895.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766315,"comment":null},{"amount":41.88,"local_amount":893.36,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":895.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209371,"comment":null},{"amount":37.42,"local_amount":798.49,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":800.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078193,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-22T18:19:31Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214541,"name":"Adela Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adela del Carmen S.

To be able to prepare gari, she buys raw, fresh cassava from the market, washes it to remove any dirt, peels it, and sends it to the mill to be milled into dough. She puts the dough in a sack with heavy stones placed on it to drain the starch out of the dough and leaves the dough for a day or two depending on the weight of the stones. After this process she stir-fries it in a pan on the fire for some time to produce gari. The gari is then left to cool and is bagged into sacks for sale.\r\n\r\nGari is one of the starchy foods in Ghana that is mostly enjoyed by students and families at large. Students eat gari a lot because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They use it for soakings (gari mixed with sugar, milk and water and sometimes peanuts). Some students also prepare gari in the form of a dough and eat it with pepper sauces and sardines.\r\n\r\nFamilies also eat gari as lunch or supper with soups or sauces. The soups that are mostly used with gari are okra soup, groundnut (peanut) soup, palm nut soup, vegetable soups and so on. On the other hand, various sauces can also be used with gari such as pepper sauce, curry sauce, tomato sauce and other varieties of sauce, depending on the family. Any kind of meat or fish can also be eaten with these soups and sauces.\r\n\r\nAma has no educational background. She is married and takes care of her six dependents. Her loan will be invested into her gari business to expand it. This she will do by buying more cassava to process into gari to distribute.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying rice, beans, oil, meats and other goods. She is selling food to people in her community for lunch. She started with her savings, and she wants this loan to improve her business. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to buy some school supplies for her children.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate\u2019s story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican - many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti - clients generally. Her group is located in Santiago, an area famous for tobacco and beef production. The second biggest city in the Dominican Republic, Santiago, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

Of her children, she lives only with Neykel (7), because her two older children are working independently. For the past 8 years, Albina has worked in farming and ranching together with her husband, who goes out every day starting at 5 in the morning to work in their fields, where they plant potatoes, peas, corn, alfalfa and a variety of vegetables. Meanwhile, Albina takes care of the 4 cows they are raising, which produce milk every day. Albina and her husband use the milk to make various delicious cheeses. They sell the cheese in local stores and also send it to some relatives who sell it in the weekly markets in the city. What Albina likes most is planting vegetables, because she can use them not only to sell, but also for the family's personal consumption. For the future, she plans to construct a recreational facility for tourists in the house where she lives. She would also like to build a house in the city in order to rent rooms and generate a better income for her family. This is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is a very active member within her communal bank.

She lives in her own home with her partner Primitivo, age 30, and their three children who are her reason for living.  For more than ten years, she and her husband have been growing different varieties of potatoes.  She also raises animals such as bulls, sheep, and pigs.  Nilda keeps the animals near the fields where she works so that she can keep watch of them.  What she enjoys most is planting potato seedlings.  In order to give them enough space to develop, she must dig furrows and overturn large amounts of soil to keep the seedlings covered until they mature.  Known for her enthusiasm, Nilda is confident that farming is a profitable endeavor.  With her earnings, she plans to buy more farmland so that she can cover her household expenses and pay for her children\u2019s education.  She wants to continue farming, but on larger tracts of land.  Nilda also plans to buy more cattle for fattening so that she can sell them on holidays.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Nilda is delighted to know that she will continue working with the other responsible members of her Communal Bank.  The loan she requested will be used to buy several bags of compost so that she can begin planting potatoes, the crop that is most produced in her area.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":568146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-17T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195450,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T13:06:34Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214585,"name":"Humberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Humberto tiene 60 a\u00f1os, reside en el Municipio de Concepci\u00f3n Batres, departamento de Usulut\u00e1n  es casado tiene dos hijos, vive con la esposa, el vende productos de primera necesidad, el negocio tiene por nombre \u201cTienda Hern\u00e1ndez\u201d.\nInicio el negocio gracias al apoya de una hermana quien fue le ense\u00f1o y le dio las herramientas para mantener la tienda, atiende el negocio en un horario de 7:00 am- 6:00 pm.

She is married to Fidmer, age 33, and they live in their own home with only one of their three children.  From a young age Rosario worked on a farm.  Her parents were experienced farmers who taught her all the farming techniques that she now employs.  Since then, fifteen years have passed.  She now works independently growing potatoes and her husband helps with monitoring their crops.  Rosario loves the land where she was born and has always planted large tracts of potatoes because the area where she lives is in high altitude, making it an ideal place for producing the best tubers.  What she enjoys most is aligning the rows of potatoes, a technique that has helped her develop freely as a farmer and has resulted in successful crops.  However, she has to carry heavy sacks of potatoes and transport them directly to the market where the buyers are located.  She does all this in order to have more income.  Rosario hopes to open a vending post at the city market where she can sell vegetables and potatoes.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first time she has taken a loan with MFP.  Rosario is happy to be working with this Communal Bank because she knows all of the members.

She is a single mother with two daughters, 16 and 13, both of whom are in school.  Margarita lives in the town of Aguilares in the \"departamento\" of San Salvador and her business is there.  She operates a business making and selling tortillas, working as much in the afternoon as at mid-day.  She works from Mondays to Sundays.  Her business is fairly steady because Salvadorans eat tortillas every day.  Thanks to the business, she has been able to provide for her two daughters, put a roof over their heads and give them a decent, if basic, standard of living.  Her first priority is her daughters for whom she does what she can to make sure that they are provided for and have a chance to get ahead in the world.  Margarita is applying for a loan so that she can buy wholesale supplies of maize because she can get a better price if she buys in bulk.  She will also buy tanks of cooking gas so that she can set a bit extra of the gas aside.  She is doing this because she wants to increase her sales and provide better service to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

He is 57 years old. Leonardo is widowed and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Leonardo owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Leonardo has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Leonardo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonardo is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Leonardo from HSPFI.

With the loan, Amelia has noticed that her monthly income has almost doubled since she has attracted new customers with additional inventory.\r\n\r\nAmelia joined Kiva partner ASHI in 1997, attracted by ASHI's lower interest rates and range of loans for business, education and home repair. Prior to ASHI, Amelia had no access to capital to support her entrepreneurial dreams. Positive growth from her business has helped Amelia fund the education of her children. Since joining ASHI, Amelia has experienced positive changes in her life and she hopes her business will continue to flourish so she can provide long-term financial stability for her family.\r\n\r\nMaking and selling foods also contributes a good income for her family and that\u2019s why, even if sometimes it is hard to do, she never gets tired of doing it. Therefore, she is now requesting another Kiva loan of 20,000 Philippine pesos to support the maintenance of her ventures.

She lives with her husband and two children. In 1998, she opened her own sewing business. Her customers come from the surrounding areas and the nearby town of Binangonan, Rizal.\r\n\r\nGemma B. is a hardworking entrepreneur determined to improve her family's standard of living. She joined Kiva's partner, ASHI, in 1998 to gain access to loans to support her entrepreneurial dreams. The first few loans she received enabled her to support the family\u2019s sewing business. The profit from this business has been the main source of family income. \r\n\r\nGemma is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for the much larger amount of 23,000 PHP to purchase cotton fabric for their sewing business. The capital will fund further expansion of the family's business ventures and help realize Gemma\u2019s dream for her children to have a decent way of life. \r\n\r\nWith these working funds, Gemma\u2019s business will keep on growing and she will be able to please her regular customers and meet their growing demands. With the support of Kiva's partner, she hopes to see herself and her family change their quality of life and move out of poverty soon. Her goal is to have a tailoring shop a few years from now, so that she can give the opportunity of employment to others, especially her extended relatives in the village. Gemma hopes to maintain a long-term sustainable business. \r\n\r\n

Despite having difficulty maintaining her business because she cannot reinvest her profits into it since it is also the main source of her family's daily expenditures, Grace is hopeful that someday her dream will land in the palm of her hand. To make this happen, Grace wants to request a much larger loan to support the needs of her business and at the same time to sustain its operation. With her great passion for giving her children a better future and decent way of life, Grace will be willing to work hard and supplement her husband\u2019s irregular income as a doormat vendor.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a loving mother, Grace\u2019s dreams are always for her five children and family. She wants to bring her children a higher quality of life. In 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. Grace hopes to secure access to capital for the continuation of her business. Her previous loans were carefully used as additional and rolling capital for her doormat-making business. \r\n<p>\r\nGrace is hopeful that her business will grow and that someday she will have more customers around the village. She also dreams of sending all her children to school until college so that they can get better jobs.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumaira belongs to a poor family living in the city of Pakpattan in Pakistan. It is not easy for an illiterate person to survive financially due to the high cost of living, but Sumaira will never give up. She started embroidering for her neighborhood clients to financially help her husband. She is also a good housewife and takes care her family very well. She is the mother of one daughter and one son, both of whom are very young and have not yet started their education. Sumaira wants to give them a quality education.

is 62 years old. He is married with 8 children between the ages of 11 and 29. Six of his children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nHe is a farmer from the town of Litein in Rift Valley, Kenya. He has been practising mixed farming for 33 years and has employed five people from his community. His main produce is tea, pineapples, and milk which he sells to the local market. He also earns income from his rental shops and houses in the same area.\r\n\r\nHis major challenge has been lack of tapped water and this has made it hard for his dairy herd since the cows have to go to the river to take water.\r\n\r\nJoseph has requested this second loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 80,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to purchase a dairy cow and expand his farm under animal feed. He says that this loan will bring in more income for the family through the sale of milk and thus improve the living standards of the family and ease payment of school fees.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to increase efficiency in his farm by owning machines like chaff cutters for animal feed and purchase a vehicle to aid in the transportation of his products to the market. He is also grateful to Juhudi for making available loan facilities for farmers like himself."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":568399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a dairy cow and expand his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Litein","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T14:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159661086,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":13600,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13902.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142399,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437230,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576585,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712340,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":13600,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13902.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872224,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":5600.03,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5724.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030093,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":6666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668167,"comment":null},{"amount":42.92,"local_amount":3433.3,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3509.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446716,"comment":null},{"amount":123.75,"local_amount":9900,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":10120.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535663,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-15T21:46:37Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:24:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214722,"name":"Otgon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Otgon D. is 40 years old and lives with her husband and two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Denis, hardworking and reserved 41-year-old married father of five children, has been operating a pork butchery business in Katojo trading Centre in Rukungiri district for over five years. He buys pigs from the surrounding villages which he slaughters and gets ready for selling to his genuine customers who have supported him this long.\r\n\r\nDenis\u2019s business has grown to the extent that he has been able to have his children undergo education.

T. is from the village of Bayug, Hinaplanan, Iligan City. She is 41 years old. Nora is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Nora operates a specialized retail store.

Karen P. is a loving mother to her only offspring and a helpful child to her parents. Despite having her own family to take care of after her marriage to a 33-year-old man name Reynaldo, Karen still wants to support the needs of her parents who are old and poor.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this, and with the addition of her dream of graduating her child from college in the future, Karen wanted to start her own business to augment the income of her husband who is a hired small-time technician.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Karen joined ASHI to request a loan that she will use as capital investment to start up a sari-sari store business. A sari-sari (variety) store basically sells small quantities of various foodstuffs, grocery items and beverages. \u201cSari\u201d is a word in the native dialect of Antiquenos meaning \u201cvariety\u201d. This is just a small store that is either attached to the owner\u2019s house or in a small native cottage not far away from the owner\u2019s house. Items sold through this business bring convenience to people in the village, especially those who live far away from the town proper where the market is located.\r\n\r\nWith ASHI and the services she can obtain through her membership, Karen is hopeful that, one day, the kind of life her family has will be comfortable.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":568444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

M., 34, is married and is the mother of two school-age children: her daughter is 15 and her son is 12. She\u2019s been married to Emilbek Risbaev for fifteen years. Janylkan is a very persistent, honest and optimistic woman who strives hard to provide her children with everything they need.\r\n\r\nJanylkan works in wholesale and retail sales of vegetables and her husband supports her business by collecting goods from different regions. In the summer, when some kinds of goods perish more quickly, Janylkan works day and night to provide good-quality products to her loyal customers.\r\n\r\nJanylkan started her business in 2000 with the sum of 1,000 KGS. Now, she earns the sum of 15,000 KGS monthly, which allowed her to purchase a small house in Sokuluk village (near Kyrgyzstan, the capital).\r\n\r\nIn May, 2010, Janylkan had a car accident and was injured - she hit her head and got a scar on her face. She spent a lot of money for surgery and treatment, which led to a decrease in her working capital. In spite of these complications, she is moving forward and applying for a loan. Using this loan, she plans to increase her current capital in order to purchase carrots to sell wholesale. It will allow her to reach the business level that she had before the accident.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Janylkan wants to buy a truck to deliver her products in a cheaper and easier way. She also plans to buy sheep for fattening and resale. These investments will help her to support her children and give them a good education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":568545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

an agricultural farm has been a tremendous business venture for Alex B. from Rugazi, Ntungamo. Being a single, energetic and determined young man who is currently in the teaching profession, he has worked tooth and nail to start up the sale of bananas, which are commonly used to prepare a local dish by customers here in Uganda.\r\n\r\nHe is fond of his enterprise and is always able to earn about $37 monthly. This loan is to help him do the mulching and to buy stake poles and pesticides for his plantation. His major future move is the further expansion of the project to a large scale. This will help to improve Alex\u2019s yields and production, creating an increase in sales revenue that will enable him enjoy a self-sustainable livelihood.\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":568507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of mulches and banana plantation supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-16T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":77859.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689448,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":77859.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903595,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":77859.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297068,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":77859.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467343,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":155718.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744645,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":77859.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482837,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":77859.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352730,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-16T15:49:25Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:02:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214800,"name":"Musahibe","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Musahibe jivet v Absheron regione .

She lives with her life partner, 38 year old Walter, and their two beautiful children.  This family lives together in their own house.  Her two children are the motivation for her to do her best at work everyday.  \r\n\r\nShe has been growing coffee and bananas for five years.  Also, she is a businesswoman selling fruit from the Peruvian jungle.  She gets them from her neighbors who produce these fruits.  She buys them, boxes them, and takes them to the Huancayo and Lima markets to sell.\r\n\r\nHer life partner offers public transportation services.  On his days off he helps Herlinda with the farming and in the business.  She enjoys the tranquility of the fields.  Nevertheless, it is difficult for her to take her products to the markets.  That is why she stocks her store with the harvest.\r\n\r\nEven though this job does not discourage her, it is seemingly self-sacrificing.  At the same time it is profitable.  Thanks to the profits she is able to give an adequate quality of life to her family.  That is why she plans to continue planting coffee, and most of all, she will increase her products and stock her establishment with them.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She pledges to continue working in an active manner in her communal bank.  She will use the requested loan to buy more fruit in order to continue selling it wholesale.  She will also buy tires for her husband\u2019s car.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":568595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","use":"Buy more fruit and sell it wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-17T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195455,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T02:52:32Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214824,"name":"Jason","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jason is a 27-year-old married man with a three-year-old child.

Ya que ellos, consideran rentable la agricultura. Adem\u00e1s le permite solventar los gastos dom\u00e9sticos, pagar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y sobre todo puede ahorrar para cubrir alguna eventualidad que se le presente en el futuro.

She is divorced and has six children, but only two of them live with her in the house that she owns.  Motivated by her desire to provide an adequate quality of life for her children, she decided to pursue a business.  She and her children grow bananas and coffee on their own property and on land that she has leased.  Julia considers farming to be profitable since it allows her to cover the household expenses, pay for her children\u2019s education, and set aside money for future expenses.  She has been farming for 15 years and is annoyed whenever her crops are infested with insects.  However, she is persistent and does not give up easily.  Every day she wakes up at 5am to prepare the meals that she takes with her into the fields, where she looks after her crops until nightfall.

For these reasons he has worked as a farmer for 15 years. Something else that makes the job less hard is the fact that his wife works alongside him. However, at harvest time and when the fields need weeding, he hires workers to help and pays them 20 soles per day.\r\n\r\nAlfonso most enjoys keeping his fields healthy and setting traps for rodents and insects so they don\u2019t harm his crops. This generous family man who loves to have his family by his side wants to increase production of bananas and coffee. As there is a great demand for them in the markets, he gets good money for his produce. In the future he plans to start a home-based business selling groceries so that his wife can look after it and stop working in the fields. This way she will be better able to take care of their son.\r\n\r\nThis is Alfonso\u2019s third loan with Kiva partner MFP and he says he is very happy to continue working with his community group as they are responsible and enterprising people like him.

Como sus actividades son rentables, quiere comprar m\u00e1s terrenos productivos que incrementen su cosechas, tambi\u00e9n piensa emprender el negocio de venta de papa, verduras y queso en los centros de abasto de la selva peruana, porque sabe que obtendr\u00e1 generosas ganancias de sus ventas.Es  la primera vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y en las \u00faltimas reuniones observo como es la metodolog\u00eda de trabajo de su grupo comunal, y asegura que le gusta porque aprende de las experiencias del resto de integrantes.Julia tiene planeado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de  varios sacos de abono y semillas de papa de la variedad Yungay, de esta manera espera obtener buenas ganancias que le permitan seguir progresando. ","en":"Julia, 46 years of age, lives in a rented home with her partner H\u00e9ctor (51) and the youngest of her 3 children as the older ones are working and now on their own.  She starts her work at 5 am every day, tending to the animals she raises \u2013 pigs and cows \u2013 after which she tends to her potato and pea crops along with her husband.\r\n\r\nShe has been raising livestock and farming for 4 years, and what she enjoys most about her work is harvesting her peas and picking the best ones to sell at the market.  There, she has many customers that she knows, although transporting the heavy sacks with her product is challenging.  In addition, she occasionally sells her livestock, and her cows produce rich fresh milk that she uses to make cheeses that she also sells.\r\n\r\nSince her activities are profitable, she would like to buy more fertile land in order to grow the size of her harvests.  She is also thinking about embarking on a business selling potatoes, vegetables and cheeses at the general stores in the Peruvian jungle because she knows she can earn a good income from her sales.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through MFP and, at recent meetings, she observed the mechanics of how her cooperative group works, which she enjoyed because she was able to learn about other members\u2019 experiences.  Julia plans to invest the funds she is requesting into the purchase of bags of fertilizer and seeds for the Yungay variety of potato.  Through these steps, she hopes to obtain good earnings that will allow her to continue to get ahead.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":568662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer and seeds to improve the productivity of her crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1058.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886545,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-02T12:09:31Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214876,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys A. is a senior high school graduate and is married with three children.\r\n\r\nGladys sells pans and ladies\u2019 underwear at Takoradi, moving from one area to another.

He owns a fiberglass manufacturing company with his wife. He had experience manufacturing car parts when he expanded into the boat industry four years ago. He generates most of his projects for his community but hopes to work with bigger clients in the area. \n\nThis is Eudocio\u2019s second loan with ACCION USA (see his previous loan here: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/164996), which he will be using to buy more materials and molds to better manufacture his fiberglass products. His work will also be showcased in an exposition next month. As a returning client, Eudocio has seen the great impact a loan can have on his business. Since coming to ACCION USA in 2009, he has been able to better keep up with his clientele\u2019s demand. \n\nEudocio hopes to acquire more projects with this loan. With new molds and materials, he plans to work on bigger boats for recreational and fishing purposes, as well as manufacturing more auto parts.\n\nEudocio\u2019s greatest challenge has been overcoming the hardships of the financial crisis and keeping his business strong. He hopes his business will become so successful that it will be very well-known.\n\n\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\n\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5075,"image":{"id":567416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

Her two older children are from her first relationship and they now live independently.  Her youngest son is from her current relationship.\r\n\r\nFor three years, she has dedicated the greater part of her day to agricultural work, which she and her partner perform on the lands she owns.  All of her sacrifices are rewarded when she sells her products, which are all native to the zone (coffee, citrus fruits, and bananas).  During harvest time, she gets help from her sons, who she pays 20 soles per day.\r\n\r\nDelia's favorite part of her job is weeding her lands so that each fruit can develop freely.  However, it is uncomfortable for her to transport the crops to her house to box them and to ship them to the markets in the city.  As her work is profitable, she would like to acquire more land and to plant more fruits.  She would also like to set up a small grocery store in her house.  She plans to finish building this soon.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that she has taken out a loan through Microfinanzas Prisma.  Since she is familiar with how her communal bank works, she is happy to continue working with this group, whose members are very responsible and united.  Delia plans to invest part of the money she's requesting to buy three bags of fertilizer, and with the rest, she will buy tens of bricks that will allow her to finish constructing her house.<br

She earns a minimum of PHP400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan.

Even though the two are not yet blessed to have their own offspring, still they are happy and they look at it as the opportunity to improve their lifestyle and financial status. In time, she believes that they will both have their own children to raise with love and a better kind of life. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Adeline manages her time equally to her responsibilities at home and to a business she put up when she joined ASHI last year and first received a loan. The amount she received then was just small, however, it was just right to start buying and selling \u201cmuscovado\u201d sugar. \u201cMuscovado\u201d is a variety of sugar that is processed naturally and free from any chemicals and preservatives. This is supposedly is the most expensive kind of sugar, wherein customers are people from class A and B. But for small-time vendors like Adeline, packaging and marketing strategies to sell more are very poor. It will incur a lot of training and financial investment for them to be able to do that, plus the fact that in the province, supply of \u201cmuscovado\u201d sugar is abundant and demand in the market is therefore low. Middlemen buy a large volume and are the ones to improve the packaging for export, selling in other cities through malls. Therefore, they\u2019re the ones who gain bigger profit. \r\n\r\nAfter six months of running a business, Adeline feels happy for the profit she has able to have out of it. She feels her business is a great help to augment the sporadic and small income of her husband, who is a hired farm laborer. With that, they are able to have a little taste of a better kind of life and Adeline is wishing to have the full taste of it by growing her business.  \r\n\r\nTo be able to do this, she is requesting a much larger amount of loan. The entire amount will be used to increase the volume of \u201cmuscovado\u201d sugar to sell and she could also buy other items or products for the same purpose.  If now she sells sugar per kilo directly to people in the market, someday she hopes to become a supplier within other provinces and\/or cities.

Even to her first husband, the woman was very loving yet their relationship did not thrive. When her first husband left, he left their two children with her. She raised them alone, supporting their needs and  education until she found another man to love and to partner with, in improving their lives. From then, she had another four children and an additional inspiration. Teodora has always been willing to venture into different kinds of income-generating activities to support her family's daily needs. Roger, her second husband is a farm laborer who makes a small income sporadically. He also cultivates a small lot in their back yard to plant vegetables. This is not enough to support the growing needs of their family, especially the education of their children who range from five to 12 years old. Teodora\u2019s children from her first husband are now 17 and 20 years old. Sadly, she was not able to send her eldest child to college but is happy to have been able to graduate her second child from a vocational course as a nursing aid. For the rest of her children, she hopes to support their education for a brighter future.\n\nLast year, Teodora joined ASHI and has received a first a loan, which she used to finance her husband's vegetable farming business and sale of fruit and vegetables.
