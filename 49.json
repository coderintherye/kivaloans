Her children help out as well when they are not in school. She works at the smallholding in the mornings and she sells vegetables and peanuts in the local market in the afternoons.

Lisis Vasquez is 38 years old, living with her partner of 16 years in Luque, Paraguay. Together Dora Lisis and her partner, Augustin Benitz Perez have three children, two boys and one girl. One of the boys has finished school and the other two, a girl of 13 and boy of 5 are still in school. Her partner currently helps her in her store. He is also working to open a liquor store of his own.<p>\r\nDora Lisis has run a copetin for the past eight years. A copetin, is a store very much like a deli, where Dora sells breakfast and lunch as well as cigarettes, icecream and other conveniences. For seven years Dora ran her store out closer the city center of Luque but moved to her present location in Asuncion in hope of earning a better weekly profit. In her current location she serves around 50 clients a day, most of which are mechanics working close to her store. <p>\r\nDora Lisis tells the Foundation that her work is very tedious. She opens her store between 5am and 6am everyday excepting weekends. In order to open in time to serve breakfast she must wake up to buy and prepare food at 3 or 4am. She does not close her store until 8pm.

She learned to cook and manage the copetin from her mother. Since then, she has bought the stand she now works out of and enjoys a well-established client base.  Her stand, which is directly to the side of the main route running through Arregua serves customers from the nearby school and other regulars from the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Victoria runs a despensa, otherwise referred to as a small grocery in which persons from the neighborhood can pick up common household necessities. These include: flour, drinks, eggs, milk and fruits and vegetables. As of  right now Victoria runs her despensa out of her home. \r\n\r\nThe money Victoria receives from both endeavors has allowed her to raise her three boys. Her youngest daughter, 10, still lives at home and thanks to Victoria\u00b4s hardwork is able to go to school. With the money she has solicited Victoria will by  merchandise for her copetin."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":84583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The constant trips that he took brought much sadness to his young children.  For that reason, they both decided to open a bakery in their small home, after seeing the need in their neighborhood.  Three months have already gone by since their family has been together and Antolina has been enjoying this very much.  Although the sacrifice to produce the breads is very arduous, she feels very happy to be with her husband.  <p>\r\n\r\nThey begin making the bread at three in the morning and then later, distribute it to the stores in their neighborhood.  Antolina also has a second job, working in an ice-cream factory.  Although now, because of decreased temperatures that are occuring every day, the demand (for ice cream) has diminished considerably.  However, she will continue to work hard to earn the money that will allow her to sustain her children.  To reach this goal, she wishes to increase the production of bread even more and to improve their little bakery by obtaining a machine that will allow her to increase the quality of production of their delicious and exquisite breads.  \r\n\r\n<p>Because of this, she has come to these integral people (Microfinanzas PRISMA), so that she can obtain this loan that she so yearns for to make her projects a reality.

His is 29 years old and studied through the 9th grade.  He supports 5 people (even though he lives with just 3) and is married.  He grew up and lived the majority of his life with his mother and siblings.  While he was a student in his free time he took classes in tailoring and practiced karate.  For the last 10 years he has been working as a tailor; sewing and doing emboidery.  He also gives sewing classes and is a sewing machine repair technician.  He employs three people, one with 5 children, another with 2 and the last with one.  With the loan for 12,000MT he plans to purchase fabric, thread and dyes.  He runs the business out of his home which enables him to open the shop at 8:00 and work for 16 hours.  His employees come using public transportation, some travling a great distance.  The raw materials are purchased in Maputo or in South Africa, and transported on public busses.  Summer is his high season since his customers re-sell his goods in open air markets or on the beaches where domestic and foreign tourists can shop and buy his products.  The average weekly income is 3,000MT - and he has a system to record the purchase of raw materials, good produced and goods sold.  His business is currently doing well and provides a monthly return of 10,000MT which he uses to care for his family, pay his employees' salaries, do some home repairs and even save a little.   For the future he plans to expand his business and to purchase additional sewing machines - to do this he will have to take out an additional loan to guarantee the success of this expansion.  His customers are very satisfied with his work and his main objective is to increase the volume of orders and hire additional employees to meet the growing demand.<p><b>\r\n\r\nTranslated by Kiva

has devoted much effort to the cultivation of mangoes and cocoa, thanks to the support of her partner whom she married years ago. Together, they've devoted their efforts and continued commitment to their agricultural work in order to give a proper education to their children who brought joy to their lives each day. But sadly, even with all their hard work and good intentions, they suffered a great tragedy when their eldest daughter suffered a serious accident in which she lost her life. This brought great anguish and sorrow to their home, but despite having great pain and sadness in their hearts, Rita collected all her strength and  took over the care of their small grandchildren (3 and 7 years old), which were orphaned when their mother died, and because their father didn't want to take responsibility of them.  Despite all the sadness (over their daughter's death), joy filled them when she and her husband took over the paternity of her grandchildren and began to work hard for them.

Before starting this business she sold desserts from home and her clients then asked her to sell juices and natural squashes, and her and her husband managed to raise $15 to start their new business.\r\n<p>\r\nThey have now been doing this for 6 years.  Although they don't have a stall in the market they have a tricycle which they use to transport their products, and the good thing is that they make everything fresh and the more they invest the more money they earn.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the three years that she has been getting loans from CEPRODEL she has been able to invest in her business and it is the only income her family has.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha's aim is to keep saving so that she can get her own stall in the market and strengthen her business, God permitting, so that they can finish building themselves a nice house.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/> <p>\r\n\r\nMartha E. es casada, su negocio consiste en preparar jugos naturales y venderlos en todo el mercado Central de Le\u00f3n. Antes de comenzar con este negocio vend\u00eda reposter\u00eda(postres) a domicilio y sus clientes le pidieron que tambien vendiera frescos (o Jugos naturales), de manera que con su esposo lograron recaudar $15 d\u00f3lares para iniciar con este nuevo negocio. <p>\r\nAhora lleva 6 a\u00f1os desempe\u00f1ando esta actividad. Aun no tienen un m\u00f3dulo dentro del mercado, le toca transportarse en un triciclo para ofrecer su producto, lo bueno es que ella ofrece algo que se consume a diario y mientras mas invierte en el negocio sus ganancias van aumentando.<p>\r\n\r\nEn estos tres a\u00f1os que lleva de trabajar con el cr\u00e9dito de CEPRODEL, ha sabido aprovecharlos y los invierte bien en el negocio, pues es su \u00fanico medio de ingreso para mantener a su familia.<p>\r\n\r\nLa meta de do\u00f1a Martha es ir ahorrando todas sus ganancias para poder comprar su propio m\u00f3dulo en el mercado y fortalecer su

He is the owner of a business that sells bags made of polyethylene.  He has been involved in this business for more than 20 years, which has allowed him to build his own house, support his entire family, and educate his children. Currently, he has a good number of customers and clients to whom he sells and supplies his products in the regions of San Bernardino, Altos, Ypacara\u00ed, Piray\u00fa, Caacup\u00e9, and Tobat\u00ed.

One of Eugenio's worries is that he cannot provide opportunities for young people, which is why even his daughters left for Spain in search of work since there are no available jobs in his country.

Though she never finished primary school, she\u2019s very optimistic about her business. She lives in the Florencia de Mora district of the Trujillo province in the Department of La Libertad.  For many years, she has devoted herself to making bread, rolls, and various cakes. Although her business has had some declines, she has always picked herself back up. Now, she sells not only bread, but also basic necessities, such as rice, sugar, oil, milk and so on. Mrs. Santos joined the communal bank \u201cGod Guide Our Steps II\u201d at the invitation of her neighbor. She received her first credit for S\/300.00 ($100), which she used to purchase flour. With other credits that she received, she made more bread, and her business began to grow; before, she baked bread with just five sacks of flour - now she uses 25 sacks. With a recent loan from Manuela Ramos for S\/600.00 ($200) that she will pay in four months, she will purchase groceries such as milk, sugar, rice, oil, and other tools for the bakery.

was born and raised in the city of Saatli in Azerbaijan. He is 34 and has two children. He was born in a low income family. In 1993 he bought a small piece of land in his village, properly equipped it, set up a tent and started selling timber. The amount of wood he had for sale depended on the time of year. Because of this seasonal property, Elshad's business needed occasional one time investments that would allow him to purchase more wood. In order to be able to increase turnover Elshad came to Normicro, a partner of Kiva,  asking to borrow $700. In the future Elshad is hoping to increase both profit and turnover, which will allow him to provide his family with all the necessities.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva

Today she keeps working in the leather trade with her uncle, and they hope to start another type of sales to be able to generate extra income.  This is why Perla is requesting the loan, mainly to purchase coal, which she will sell out of her home, in addition to the leather goods that she makes.<p>\r\nThe sales of this new product will generate good profits because in this area, the demand for coal is high and there are few businesses that sell it. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Perla es casada y tiene un hijo de 6 a\u00f1os, ella proviene de la ciudad de arroyos y esteros, pero vive hace varios a\u00f1os en la ciudad de Mariano R.

They provide all types of photographic services and sell every imaginable camera accessory. Film is developed and cameras, batteries, and even movies are sold within their walls. Albertina and her husband have been the sole owners of their studio for almost one year and a half. Before, Albertina was working in various other photo studios in the area and her husband was an employee in the shop they currently own, under different management. When the owner of the studio Albertina\u2019s husband was working in retired, the couple jumped at the opportunity to buy the studio and apply the knowledge they had been gaining over the past several years. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, Albertina\u2019s photo studio is a rapidly growing business where she and her husband are busily attending to their many customers. When asked if she has any goals for maximizing the growth of her business, Albertina\u2019s eyes widen and she sighs with an exasperated expression she saying \u201cyes!\u201d The machine currently being used to develop customers\u2019 film is rented, and to own one themselves would be an incredible help, she explains. As well, they still lack the equipment to develop digital pictures. Acquiring such capabilities would allow Albertina and her husband to enter an entirely new market and bring their photo business to the next level. \r\n<p>\r\nEverything Abertina and her husband do is with the motivation of supporting their growing family of a seven year-old daughter and baby girl on the way.

The products she buys and sells vary, however the one thing she always sells is cheese. She loves the specific type of Ayacuchano cheese which is white and has a very strong taste salty, made from cow\u2019s milk. The cheese is made in small blocks which she loads into her three buckets to sell. Along with cheese, when animals are available in the markets, mostly sheep and pigs, she also brings these home to sell the meat, a more profitable venture. Delia has many regular clients that depend on her for their weekly supplies of cheeses and meats, she explains, and she delivers these products straight to their doors. \r\n<p>\r\nThis mother of two beautiful girls has been practicing this trade for as long as she can remember. Her mother was involved in the same venture, and she grew up traveling back and forth between city and countryside, learning the tricks of the trade. As a professional goal, Delia explains that for her entire life she has dreamed of owning her own small grocery store. An additional dream of hers is to one day be the owner of her very own home, to which she would attach the small store. Because she has been saving diligently for the past 8 years, Delia explains that she has been able to buy a piece of property, and as her capital continues to grow, she will soon be able to begin construction on her home and grocery store. \r\n<p>\r\nDelia says she feels very happy to have been a part of her village bank for the past 8 years.

For three years she has been running the business, chatting with customers, and buying supplies. When one steps inside the store, it\u2019s hard to believe Livia began so humbly. Before her grocery store, Livia was selling fruits from a small cart just outside a busy Ayacuchan market. It is an exceptionally difficult way to make a living and lacks the permanence and consistency necessary to support a family. This is why, when Livia\u2019s second daughter was born, she decided to leave fruits behind and open a grocery store from her home. She began with only 300 Nuevo Soles in her pocket (about $100 USD), and with this she was able to buy 15 lbs. each of rice, oil, flour and a few other staple food items. It certainly wasn\u2019t much, but little by little, Livia was able to save up her money, accumulate capital, and today she has an entire grocery store filled with large varieties of foods, beverages, and household items. \r\n<p>\r\nA principal element in the success of Livia\u2019s grocery store has been her village bank. When she began with 300 Nuevo Soles, it was without any economic help. However, as soon as she joined her bank and began to take out loans, she was allowed incredible economic opportunities on which she capitalized with efficiency. Her village bank also taught her how to save her money formally in an account, instead of in her home where it is very difficult to save. Due to such lessons and opportunities, Livia is able to look forward to greater aspirations for her business and family. Professionally, Livia says she would love to renovate her store and maybe one day open in a new location in the city. As far as her family of 2 daughters and a husband is concerned, she plans to renovate their home from clay and straw thatching to sturdier and more comfortable materials. \r\n<p>\r\nLivia is requesting a loan of $1000. With this money, she will be able to buy and sell more of everything she stocks in her store, thus attracting more clients and earning greater profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":84975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Increase the amount and variety of goods to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-18T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Livia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-03T17:03:51Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2997,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":749.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107579,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127468,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148191,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":749.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172614,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-19T17:03:51Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24407,"name":"Yenny Gertrudis","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Yenny is a hardworking 22-year-old mother who since she had her son has dedicated herself to selling artisan crafts, always with her young baby by her side.

She prepares all the regional favorites of her hometown of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa including chicken soups, \u201cpuca picante\u201d which is a dish containing beans, peanuts, beets and potatoes, and \u201cmodongo\u201d a favorite weekend dish that contains corn and beef and cooks all night long. Although she cooks a variety of foods, Marizta\u2019s specialty is \u201cchicharr\u00f3n,\u201d which is deep fried pork. This she sells just around the corner from her home in a busy market area. \u201cMari,\u201d as her friends and neighbors call her, sells here during the weekdays and her stand has become a very popular attraction for all in the area. Her second stand is set up in the rural countryside of Ayacucho, a few hours outside the city limits. Because it is very popular for families to take a relaxing day trip to the country during the weekends, Maritza has taken advantage of the weekend traffic, selling a wider variety of dishes to many passersby. Maritza also travels to all the festivals in the area, selling to the large celebrating crowds. \r\n<p>\r\nOne day, Maritza says she would love to open a large restaurant in the city center of Ayacucho.

Two years ago, Maritza began taking out loans to increase her business and her profits, helping her circle in on the eventual accomplishment of the opening of her restaurant. She has loved being a part of her village bank because she says it has taught her how to save her money in the bank where it accumulates interest.

This single mother of 2 children has owned a small grocery store or \u201ctienda D. abarrotes\u201d for the past ten years. Modesta began working as a \u201cferiante,\u201d which means that she would travel from the city of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa several hours to the rural countrysiD. to buy large supplies of cereals and other products to bring home and sell in the smaller city markets. It was an extremely difficult way of life, and one which did not allow the generation of much profit. It had always been a dream of Modesta\u2019s to open a grocery store, and so one day she decided to change gears completely and accomplish her lifelong goal. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, 10 years later, Modesta is the proud owner of a beautiful grocery store in a neighborhood just outsiD. the city center of Ayacucho. As the keen businesswoman Modesta has grown to be, she is always looking for ways to increase the amount of business that passes through her doors. She began with a simple supply of \u201cabarrotes,\u201d or staple food items sold in bulk such as rice, flour and cooking oil. This grew to the supply of more specialized food items, candies, and sodas. Just recently, she has begun selling a wiD. selection of fresh vegetables and homemaD. condiments. Daily she prepares a variety of traditional Peruvian condiments such as chili and garlic sauces that greatly help her busy customers in the preparation of their daily meals. Modesta decided to add these new products to her grocery store because she says the only way to attract more customers is through offering new and different products. She happily reports that the vegetables and condiments have been a great success and she is serving even more customers than ever. \r\n<p>\r\nModesta is currently working towards her goal of renovating her home and grocery store. It is the next step, she says, in the continual improvement of her business. It is very necessary that she turns over the greatest profit possible as she not only supports her two children, but also the three surviving grandchildren of her son who just recently passed away. For this reason, she is very happy to be a part of her village bank. There, she has learned how to save her money in the bank where it accumulates interest. It is also a place where she is able to socialize with friends and be distracted from the difficulties of life. Modesta is currently requesting a loan of $300, with which she will buy larger quantities of products to stock in her grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":84987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy larger quantities of goods to sell in her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-03T05:10:57Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":898,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":224.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107582,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127471,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148194,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172617,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-19T05:10:57Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24414,"name":"Maruja","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"We found Maruja very happily and eagerly cleaning her restaurant, which is the only source of income her and her husband, Crist\u00f3bal, count on to provide for their family.

There, she buys a large supply of meat which she transports via bus to the rural countryside. Once well outside the city, Nora sets up a stand selling the fresh meat by the kilo. She also makes sure, she says, to bring along supply of shoes to sell, because a variety of products is the key to attracting customers. \r\n<p>\r\nThe days that Nora isn\u2019t selling products from behind one of her three different stands are not spent idly. Her husband also works extremely hard, explains Nora, and while he is away, she takes care of their three children. In fact everything Nora does is for her kids. She is currently saving up her money to buy a house for herself and her husband, leaving the house they presently own for her sons and their families. Professionally, Nora says her dream is to leave the tiresome traveling behind and open a small grocery store. \r\n<p>\r\nAll these dreams are possible thanks in large part to Nora\u2019s involvement with her village bank. For the past 4 years, she has been learning how to save her money and accumulate capital. Nora is requesting a loan of $900. With this money, she will buy a larger supply and greater quantity of shoes and sandals to sell from her stand in the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":84991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a larger supply and greater quantity of shoes and sandals to sell from her stand in the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T17:41:27Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2697,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":674.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":674.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":674.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":674.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:19:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108264,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128257,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149305,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173649,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T17:41:27Z","paid_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24417,"name":"Br\u00edgida","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"12 years ago Br\u00edgida and Eleuterio, natives of Cojata, decided to come together and form their own family.

It was an extremely difficult way to make a living, she explains, so she decided to move back to her hometown of Ayacucho where she has been able to buy her own home and begin her small business in clothing sales. For the past 6 years, her business has been growing steadily and she currently has many regular clients who come to her for all of their clothing needs.

nearly 20 years, Zenobia has been buying and selling a specific type traditional dress worn by the women in the region of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa. As one walks down a street in Ayacucho, it is very common to see the women wearing beautiful, brightly colored and intricately embroidered skirts. This skirt is called a \u201ccentro\u201d and the slips that are worn underneath to add fullness are called \u201cfustanes.\u201d Zenobia has capitalized on the long standing popularity of these beautiful skirts and sells them to many clients in the area. \r\n<p>\r\nTo obtain her supply of skirts, Zenobia travels to the nearby city of Huancayo, where the skirts are mass produced. These she brings to her stand in one of the markets just outside the city of Ayacucho to sell. Because the skirts are so finely detailed and of such high quality, they are very expensive. One skirt, she explains, sells for 400 Nuevo Soles, or about $130 USD. This is so prohibitively expensive for the majority of Zenobia\u2019s, that many buy an outfit on credit or even pay her in food products, such as cereals instead of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol.  \r\n<p>\r\nZenobia explains that when she joined her village bank some 10 years earlier, she only had enough capital to request a loan of $50, an amount that doesn\u2019t even come close to the purchase of a single skirt. Today, however, after much hard work and diligence, Zenobia is able to request a loan of $500. This growth, Zenobia explains, would not have been possible without the help from her village bank. Not only has it provided her with ample economic opportunities, it has also taught her how to be a confident female leader. All this has made the support of her 5 children and husband much easier. With the $500 she is requesting, Zenobia will be able to buy more skirts in Huancayo to sell in Ayacucho. She says she is constantly working toward her ultimate goal of opening her own store in downtown Ayacucho."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":85016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more skirts to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenobia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T05:09:42Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1498,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":374.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":374.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":374.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":374.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:19:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108266,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128259,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149307,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173651,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T05:09:42Z","paid_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24434,"name":"Natalia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Natalia, 47, is a loving mother of three.

Previosuly, Rosario was just dedicated to studying.

For this reason she will continue working and managing her own business with the longing to make it grow and create her own enterprise that will generate resources for her family and a group of families in her neighborhood. Rosario wants to open a store where she sells medical materials and instruments commercially because her house is located close to a hospital, but meanwhile she will continue working in her convenient store and extending the same quality of service as always.

All the life lessons that she received in her home have  taught her to practice efficient labor in the fields of cultivation, dedicating herself to sowing potatoes, corn, and vegetables. She also raises cows and grows alfalfa for them year after year. Thanks to this activity she can satisfactorily meet the needs of her family and be a very important leader in the maintenance of her home, along with her husband who also aids her in these activities. Although last year she lost her entire harvest and earnings when an unending winter force fell over her fields, this did not discourage her and she continues forward by having planned to grow spinach and carrots this year during the wait period for the potato and corn harvests. Domitilia does all these activities for her three children who motivate her to continue forward with her longings to offer them the best so that they can achieve higher education. For this reason she is requesting a loan for this growing season to buy seeds and fertilizer and also improve her little cattle stable. All this and each of these earnings will be for the benefit and education of her children.

Su primer cr\u00e9dito fu\u00e9 hace tres a\u00f1os y lo invirti\u00f3 para completar el dinero y comprar su tramo(m\u00f3dulo) dentro del Mercado, ya con esto ella comenz\u00f3 a surtir m\u00e1s el negocio.<p>\r\n\r\nElla nos comenta que antes de trabajar en este negocio se desempe\u00f1aba como dom\u00e9stica, lavaba ropa y planchaba a domicilio. Toda la familia ha visto lo rentabnle que es este negocio y cuanto apoyo ha recibido  con la organizaci\u00f3n que le ha brindado los cr\u00e9ditos.

Without a doubt this has thwarted the income she managed to gain through her job, and is therefore wanting to buy a stand in the market so that she stops being the object of maltreatment and the constant evictions. <p>\r\n\r\nBeside the sale of clothing, she also wishes to start selling shoes in her new stand so that she makes money to save enough and achieve her future goals. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan and is asking us to collaborate with the crystallization of her goals to establish herself promptly in a safe and comfortable place.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Luis L\u00f3pez Martinelli, Kiva Volunteer.\r\n<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Victoria, hace ya tres a\u00f1os vende ropa en el mercado de Pichanaki, ella es una modesta madre de familia que a costa de mucho sacrificio ha logrado reunir una considerable cantidad de  dinero para comprar prendas de vestir muy variadas y trabajar en este mercado muy concurrido.Actualmente, la municipalidad viene ubic\u00e1ndola en distintos puestos sin tener un lugar definido donde desempe\u00f1arse, adem\u00e1s de los elevados precios que le cobran por su permanencia, sin duda estos hechos  han mermado considerablemente los ingresos econ\u00f3micos que obten\u00eda con su trabajo, por lo que ella desea mucho comprar un puesto de ventas  en el mercado para dejar de ser objeto de maltratos y desalojos.Adem\u00e1s de la venta de ropa desea ofrecer tambi\u00e9n zapatos en su nuevo peque\u00f1o establecimiento, para que pueda ahorrar dinero con el objeto de alcanzar sus metas futuras.Solicita un pr\u00e9stamo y nos pide colaboremos con la cristalizaci\u00f3n de su ansiado para establecerse pronto en un lugar c\u00f3modo y seguro."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":85193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchasing small store space in the most busy market to continue offering her garments \/\r\nCompra de un peque\u00f1o espacio de ventas en el mercado m\u00e1s concurrido de su ciudad para continuar ofreciendo sus bellas prendas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T13:04:19Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:19:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108293,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128292,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149355,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173699,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-05-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200895,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":242.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":254.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":228029,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T13:04:19Z","paid_date":"2008-06-04T09:10:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24475,"name":"Maybe Liz","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Sra.

The skills learned in a tontine can be very useful in a group loan situation, as both rely heavily on group decision-making, group governance and management of money. With almost no social systems to look out for the elderly, this type of group cohesion is extremely beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes time to spend the profits in the pooled account, the group will have a group meeting.

is a group loan to be shared by the ten women of the Balandite 1 group, led by Ms. Jacqueline D..  This is the women's second Kiva loan.  When the first loan was repaid, Balandite divided into two groups, Balandite 1 and Balandite 2, each of which is requesting a second Kiva loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen the group received their first loan they partitioned the money into portions of 25,000 CFA ($50), of 50,000 CFA ($100), or 75,000 CFA ($150), which were then distributed to the different group members. The different members work and function independently, while sharing the responsibility of repayment. They all sell mainly household products, but they do not all sell the same things.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nJacqueline sells soap, pens, erasers, notebooks, basins, SOS pads, among other things. Other group members sell things like palm oil, peanuts and limes. Jaquline buys her products in Dakar where they are cheap, and sells them at a mark-up here in M\u2019Lomp. As an example, she can buy a pack of 24 SOS pads for 1,200 CFA ($3.00). She then sells each SOS pad individually for 100 CFA, or 2,400 CFA for the 12 (a 100% mark-up!). Goods are shipped from Dakar to this region via a cargo boat.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWhen asked to discuss the difficulties associated with this business, Jacqueline states that poverty is everywhere. I asked her to explain what she meant. She told me that it is very common for someone to pay for a more expensive good like a basin (which sells for 1,000 CFA or $2.00) in three payments. What this means for Jacqueline is that she has capital tied up and is chasing for payments.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAs far as future business plans, Jacqueline would like to take another loan and continue to expand her business. One thought for expansion is to sell products indigenous to this region in Dakar. She proudly states that she knows this type of business well and has the skill set to manage this type of expansion. Another idea is to build a proper shop outside of her home (she lives just off the main road). At the moment people know that she has these types of products and will come seek her out to buys goods, but she would love to formalize and with a larger quantity of goods in a traditional store. \r\n<p>\r\nTo learn more about Ms. D. and her colleagues, see Balandite's former Kiva business description at http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=670.\r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group.

is a group loan to be shared by the ten women of the Balandite 1 group, led by Ms. Jacqueline M..  This is the women's second Kiva loan.  When the first loan was repaid, Balandite divided into two groups, Balandite 1 and Balandite 2, each of which is requesting a second Kiva loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen the group received their first loan they partitioned the money into portions of 25,000 CFA ($50), of 50,000 CFA ($100), or 75,000 CFA ($150), which were then distributed to the different group members. The different members work and function independently, while sharing the responsibility of repayment. They all sell mainly household products, but they do not all sell the same things.  Some sell soap, pens, erasers, notebooks, basins, SOS pads, among other things. Other group members sell things like palm oil, peanuts and limes. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nTo learn more about this group, see Balandite's former Kiva business description at http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=670.\r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

L. La (aged 47) and his wife, Keat Pov (aged 39) got married in 1986.  They have three daughters and two sons, two of whom still study in school and two who work in a garment factory.  They are requesting their first loan from MAXIMA in the amount of $1,000. They will use this loan to purchase three cows, a boat and a fishing net.   \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, they grow food such as rice and raise chickens and a few pigs.  La also does construction work when he can find employment.  As is typical here in Cambodia, we met beneath their stilt house in the area that serves as an indoor\/outdoor live\/work space.  La explained that he actually built his family\u2019s home in 1994 using salvaged lumber.  The many tunnels and voids gnawed by termites testified to both the decrepitude of the prior dwelling that was the source of the lumber and the imminent need for replacement of this one.  When they save enough money, Pov and La said they hope to replace their very modest house with a new one.  \r\n<p>\r\nLa learned to raise cows many years ago before the Pol Pot regime here in Cambodia.  Because it is relatively expensive, beef has fallen down the list of sources of protein.  Nonetheless, as the economy joins in the growth of the other countries in this region, beef is regaining popularity.  Pov and Las's use mosquito netting to protect the animals from murderous bites and have already walled off a space beneath their house to use as a stall.  \r\n<p>\r\nPov and La explained that there is a breeder near their village who sells a bovine \u201cstarter pack\u201d of sorts \u2013 one adult male and one adult female for US $400 each plus one calf free of charge.  La and Pov say that it takes one year to raise a cow to maturity.  In that time, it will eat approximately $200 worth of food \u2013 mostly grass and rice straw.  These both need to be purchased due to high population density and to flooding during monsoon season (both factors limiting grazing space).  When the cow is mature, they sell it either for slaughter or for further husbandry.  \r\n<p>\r\nBy far the most popular source of protein here is fish.  This country is graced with an abundance of freshwater lakes from which Cambodians harvest two-thirds of the protein they consume.  La has fished for many years but has never owned his own boat.  A used boat and a net will cost them about

T. Ly (aged 53) and his wife Chhet Srey (aged 50) got married in 1981.  They have nine children, seven of whom still live at home and four who are still in school.  This $700 loan is their first loan from MAXIMA. They will use this loan to purchase seed for vegetable produce, fertilizer and pesticide.  They have been farming for fifteen years.  \r\n<p>\r\nLy and his family live on the edge of a large, shallow depression just west of the Tonle Bassac (river) south of Phnom Penh.  During the wet season, the depression fills with water for about three months.  As the water recedes, local people plow and plant vegetables in the very fertile soil.  To make the most of the growing season, they start seedlings in protected areas in their front yards (see photo).  As soon as the plots are ready, they transfer the seedlings to the open depression.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe main vegetable Ly and his family grow is a leafy green similar to broccoli.  In a normal season, they can get five cuttings.  Over the nine-month dry season they can plant three times.  They also grow some cucumbers, cabbage and corn.  They irrigate using a gas powered pump.  Many people in the area still carry water in large sprinkler cans carried one to a shoulder.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey sell their produce to buyers who, in-turn, sell it in the large markets of Phnom Penh.  They both say that farming has been a good livelihood and they\u2019ll continue to do it as long as they can.  Their farming future is not guaranteed.  They explained that the government is considering building a large port facility along the Tonle Bassac which could encroach on their farming plot.  If this happens, they would have to sell their land and move elsewhere to farm.  As of now, those development plans remain speculative and the farming continues.

She attended school only until the 6th grade due to her family's financial situation.\r\n<p>\r\nShe met her husband in 1985 and moved in with her mother-in-law in the Massaca neighborhood, where she busied herself solely with the housework. The following year, she felt the need to obtain employment to help with the household expenses, so she worked as a domestic worker at a home in the city of Maputo for a year and a half.<p>\r\nIn 1987, she and her husband purchased a parcel of land in the town of Boane. There they built a house and moved in a year later. Since then, she has devoted herself to money-making activities, specifically the sale of essential products. In 2006, she rented a space in the town of Boane where she continued to sell a variety of products.\r\n<p>Three months later, the owner decided to sell her the space. As she was determined to own her own business, she purchased it and operates from there to this day. Through some of her friends and neighbors who were Hluvuku clients, she came to know of this institution. She applied for her first loan of 30,000 MT in 2006 and repaid it without incident. With the loan of 15,000 MT she plans to increase stock. She currently employs one worker, thereby helping to reduce the high local unemployment rate. The profits from the business help her care for her family as well as cover expenses for her children\u2019s school and healthcare.<p>\r\n\r\nThis client\u2019s business has had a positive impact on the community. The business is located in a passenger terminal, where she offers thirst-quenching refreshments to travelers and students.

After 40-45 days of feeding them, Safar sells the animals and uses his revenues to purchase new animals; he uses the profits to support his family.  By taking out a loan he will be able to increase his earnings and the loan will also give local butchers the opportunity to purchase animals for slaughter and to supply meat products to local residents.  Safar plans to pay back the loan over a 10 month period.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432

Purchase and Retail<\/p>\r\n\r\nAlzira Salvador Sitoe was born on August 20th, 1974 in the city of Maputo. In 1992 she met her husband with whom she has had 6 children. She lived with her parents until the age of 18 and, due to financial hardship, she only attended school until the fifth grade. \r\nIn 1993 she launched and witnessed her small business venture fail caused by complications she faced with her first pregnancy. She then decided to look for a financial institution willing to help.\r\nShe first borrowed money from the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Gueguegue (Gueguegue Association) located in Boane, which offered credit to group applicants. It turned out not to be a good experience because the amount granted was smaller than the amount requested and she had to be responsible for the payments in case one of the other partners defaulted. \r\nShe became aware of Hluvuku-Adsema existence through a friend and because she wanted to expand her business, she requested her first loan. The loan amount of 13.000,00MT will be used to increase stock inventory.\r\nCurrently, she is running her business with help from her husband. Her children help around also anytime they are unable to be present. The profit generated is used to cover household expenses such as school costs and health care for her children. \r\nHer business has a positive impact in the community because it provides employment to herself and her husband and also it brings needed products closer to customers.\r\nIn the future she intends to open up a new location under her name.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by

sido boa experi\u00eancia porque para alem dos valores cedidos serem menores tinham de assumir a responsabilidade de pagar o empr\u00e9stimo em caso de um dos elementos n\u00e3o efectuar o pagamento .\r\nConheceu a Hluvuku-Adsema atrav\u00e9s da amiga e dai aproximou-se e solicitou o seu 1\u00ba empr\u00e9stimo para amplia\u00e7\u00e3o do seu negocio.\r\nCom este empr\u00e9stimo de 13.000,00 mt

He has transformed part of his house into a store that is located in Beshkapa village in the Yavan region.  The store is open 24 hours a day.  <p>\r\n\r\nKurbonhol plans to use his loan to increase his inventory and product selection.  The loan will help the residents of the village and nearby areas to purchase necessary food items as the closest stores are several kilometers away, closer to the center of the region and close around 5pm.  Kurbonhol plans to pay back the loan over a 6 month period.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432

N. is 32 years old, has a secondary education and 1 child.  Sanovbar works at a market in Nurek, \u201cFarovon,\u201d where she sells salads, vegetables, marinated vegetables and fabrics for making women\u2019s clothing.  She has been in this business for 8 years.  Sanovbar plans to use the loan to purchase fabrics for autumn ethnic clothing and to temporarily stop selling vegetables which require travel to the Dushanbe market which is too expensive.  She will continue to sell salads and marinated vegetables, because she has regular customers for these.  <p>\r\n\r\nBecause residents of Nurek mostly work at the Nurek Hydro Electricity Station they cannot always travel to Dushanbe to make purchases.  This loan will allow the residents of Nurek, specifically women to purchase fabric to make women\u2019s ethnic clothing which is in high demand.  Sanovbar plans to repay the loan over a 12 month period.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

A., 30, is married and has 2 children. Akobirdgon has a college degree in biochemistry. Akobirdgon\u2019s primary job is managing a biochemistry lab at the Yavana city hospital. In addition, Akobirdgon has a cattle farm at his home in the village of Kambari. Akobirdgon plans to use this loan to purchase 3 animals, so he can raise and sell them later on. Akobirdgon has been in farming business for 3 years. Every 40-45 days, he sells raised cattle and uses the money to buy new animals at lower prices. Akobirdgon uses the profits to provide for his family, because the money he earns at the hospital is not enough to sustain his family. He plans to repay the loan with 10 months.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0432

She started with a loan of 30USD to buy and sell agricultural products.  She spent most of the profit from that loan on her everyday living expenses, and was able to save a small amount.  After three years borrowing from TYM Fund, Mrs. B. has gained more confidence to borrow more money to buy old barrels and discarded plastic, etc to sell to recycle companies.  From bare hands, Mrs. B. is now an owner of a recycle store where she has three employees working for her, each gets a wage of 60 USD per month.  Each month Mrs. B. earns about 375USD.  Thanks to the loan from TYM Fund, she was able to build a convenient, three-storey house.

In 2006, she again borrowed money from TYM Fund (Kiva partner).  This time she wants to borrow 575USD to expand her tailoring shop.  Since her shop is located in the center of the village, it is often very crowded.  Although very busy with her job, Mrs. T. still spends a lot of time taking care of her children.

With an initial capital of Rp 1,000,000 (about US$105) Wiryawati bought 1 mother pig that she raised for 6 months. After 6 months, the mother pig gave birth to 6 piglets; after raising these piglets for another 2 months, those piglets were sold at Rp250,000 (about US$26)\/piglet. Profit was used to pay for schooling expenses for her 2 children who are still in Grade school, and also to cover family needs. Now with capital help from Dinari, Wiryawati could add the mother pig, and fattening piglets.

Sophin L. (age 35) and her husband (age 34) have been married for 10 years.  They have 2 children, one boy and one girl.  The girl who is the eldest, studies in school in their village.  They live in a fertile farming area along the Tonle Bassac (river), a tributary of the Mekong, several kilometers south of Phnom Penh.  Her husband drives a multi-person motorbike taxi called a \u201cremorque\u201d, transporting workers to and from the many nearby garment factories.  She is requesting this second loan from MAXIMA in the amount of $600. She will use the funds from the loan to purchase a motorbike for transporting fish that she resells in her village.  Any remaining money she will use for buying fish for re-sale.<p>She has been buying and reselling fish since 1997.  Fish is, by far, the most common source of protein in Cambodia.  Sophin says she typically sells about three kilograms per day.  Over the course of the year, she says she sells perhaps 7 or 8 different kinds, depending which type is in season.  Depending on the kind of fish, the sales price ranges from 5,000-12,000 Riel (US $1.25-$3.00) per kilogram and she nets about 50% profit.  Sophin usually goes to a nearby village on the edge of a large lake to purchase her fish.  In the event she can\u2019t buy what she needs there, she travels to the larger district market to buy.  She then returns to re-resell her inventory at the small market that springs up along the road in her village.  In the event she can\u2019t sell everything she buys, she goes door-to-door in her village to move the remaining stock.<p>Sophin\u2019s long-term hopes are to keep growing her business.  She explained that the loan will allow her to travel to and from where she buys fish much more easily.  She also hopes that she\u2019ll be able to save more money to improve her family\u2019s

present, educational needs at kindergarten-level are being very poorly met in the community of Thiaroye-Sur-Mer. Given the extent of the problem, the government does not seem to be in a position to give full support where it is needed in order for this educational sector to flourish. The sector therefore requires initiatives from locally-based associations, which are aware of the need to participate in such undertakings. This is why the Association for the Community Support and Development Initiative of Thiaroye-Sur-Mer \u2013 whose aim is to help increase the availability of preschool education and improve its quality \u2013 has opened a school within the community that is subsidized by the members of the Association. It is therefore out of concern to achieve these objectives that we are asking you for this loan. The loan will enable us to strengthen the activities in this sector. Students pay a monthly contribution, which will allow us to repay this loan, as well as help with other activities. \r\nOur Group has 11 members and the reason we have posted only one photo, that of the Association\u2019s president, is because we were unable to have a photo taken of the entire group. We are therefore listing below the names of the other 10 Association members. \r\n1-Assane Gueye \r\n2-Lamine Samg 3-Salif Diedhiou 4-Astou K Seye \r\n5-Chieckh T Diagne \r\n6-Baytir Sy \r\n7-Dialma Badji \r\n8-Massamba L\u00f4 \r\n9-N\u00e9n\u00e9 Diabang \r\n10-Mamadou Dieng\r\n Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer.\r\nLe niveau actuel de couverture des besoins en \u00e9ducation pour la cat\u00e9gorie class\u00e9e  dans la petite enfance est tr\u00e8s faible dans la commune d\u2019arrondissement de thiaroye sur mer.

Partant de ce fait, le secteur a besoin d\u2019initiatives venant des collectivit\u00e9s de base qui doivent \u00eatre conscientes de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 leur prise en charge. C\u2019est pourquoi  initiative de thiaroye sur mer pour la solidarit\u00e9 et le d\u00e9veloppement (ITSD)_qui ambitionne de participer au rel\u00e8vement de l\u2019offre d\u2019\u00e9ducation pr\u00e9scolaire et de participer \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9ducation pr\u00e9scolaire a ouvert une \u00e9cole communautaire qui est subventionn\u00e9e par les membres de la dite association.
