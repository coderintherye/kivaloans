Tawfig collected those materials and purchased some more mobile accessories and started his independent business. Now, Tawfig has many clients and his income improved.  When he is at university, he places his younger brother in the business.\r\n\r\nTawfig wanted to expand his business but he didn't have the financial capacity. He took this first loan from AMB and repaid it successfully. Then he took this loan, which is the second loan amounting to 100,000 Rials in order to purchase stationary supplies and phone accessories to meet his clients' demands.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Tawfig hopes to expand his business by opening a supermarket as well as to establish an independent business for his younger brother.

Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan.

She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, H\u01b0\u1eddng owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from raising ducks for sale.  H\u01b0\u1eddng has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H\u01b0\u1eddng joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u01b0\u1eddng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,288,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  H\u01b0\u1eddng is now requesting a new loan of 9,632,000 VND which will be used to purchase poultry feed & other supplies.  This will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H\u01b0\u1eddng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide micro-finance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH\u01b0\u1eddng H. l\u00e0 35 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

She is married and has four school-aged children.  To make a living, Ti\u1ec1n owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.  Ti\u1ec1n has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ti\u1ec1n joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ti\u1ec1n has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,288,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  Ti\u1ec1n is now requesting a new loan of 9,184,000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  This will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Ti\u1ec1n plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

","en":"Barno is married and has three children.  Her husband is working in Russia.  In order to support her family, Barno is involved in fattening up livestock, growing potatoes and processing apricots and apples.  All of this is difficult for a woman, but she must do this hard labor to provide for her children.

Sylvia is 20 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past three years, Sylvia has been working hard to manage her farm supply shop, which sells seeds and equipment to local farmers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sylvia has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more farm tools for resale, and will help Sylvia to generate greater profits and take care of her family. Sylvia hopes that in the future she will be able to save money to buy a plot of land, and to open other branches of her shop. \r\n\r\nSylvia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Sylvia's future prospects by helping her to learn more about how to save and how to be financially literate.

Grace is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children with one of them currently in school. For the past six years, Grace has been working hard to manage her retail shop which sells food and home supplies to local customers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food and supplies for resale and will help Grace to generate greater profits and solve domestic problems. Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to educate her children and buy a cow. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills training. The ELA program has improved Grace's future prospects by helping her to learn how to manage her business.

Immaculate is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kacwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past six years, Immaculate has been working hard to manage her fast food stand, which sells pancakes and a traditional Ugandan bread called chapate. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Immaculate has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more baking flour, and will help Immaculate to generate greater profits and improve her family's quality of life. Immaculate hopes that in the future she will be able to buy land and build a house for her family. \r\n\r\nImmaculate is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Immaculate's future prospects by helping her to learn how to read, how to save and how to budget.

Jenina is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children. For the past three years, Jenina has been working hard to manage her small grocery store, which sells dry foods like maize and coffee. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jenina has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food and supplies, and will help Jenina to generate greater profits and improve her family's quality of life. Jenina hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nJenina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jenina's future prospects by helping her to learn how to take care of customers.

They all live in a little house that\u2019s humble but theirs.  Since childhood Mateo has been farming, an activity that has provided sustenance to support his family all this time.  His children are strong enough now to help him with the field work so the entire family, including Antonia, works hard in the fields.  \r\n\r\nHis main crop is peas since that\u2019s what earns the most income but he also grows potatoes, lima beans and corn.  The main difficulty this tireless father faces throughout his life is the lack of capital to expand his crops and produce in larger quantities, a situation he\u2019s been managing thanks to the coordinated work with his communal bank.  Later on he\u2019d like to see his children study technical or university careers in the city so he continues working the land to save up and reach his goals.\r\n\r\nThis will be the 8th time Mateo works with MFP and his communal bank for which he feels much affection because they are always concerned for his needs.  Because of this, he needs their help to continue along his road to self-improvement.  With the money, he\u2019ll be able to hire personnel to help him with potato planting and harvesting which he calculates will not be more than five day workers for five days which will mean a daily expense of 28 soles per worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":902971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-24T18:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mateo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-31T14:41:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":350531,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1538.94,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes for resale","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2400,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":367.14},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":377.64},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":393.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":405.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":420.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":436.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":367.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":377.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":393.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":405.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":436.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":357.66,"local_amount":357.66,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T09:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":357.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245037033,"comment":null},{"amount":774.24,"local_amount":774.24,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":774.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250837924,"comment":null},{"amount":407.04,"local_amount":407.04,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":407.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263909356,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T22:14:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":350532,"name":"Alcira Enoe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alcira Enoc tiene 47 a\u00f1os, su actividad es una pulper\u00eda.

She is aware that her money does not stretch far enough so she also works in a villa cooking for athletes and earning a monthly salary.  On the other hand, thanks to experiences of her friends and neighbors she knows that selling vegetables is profitable.  She plans to buy peas, olluco [a tuber] and potatoes at wholesale to sell in the city of Lima.  The main problem she\u2019s faced throughout these years of non-stop struggle is the lack of capital to stock her store.  Later on, following a recommendation from a cousin, she plans to travel to Spain to work there and send back money to her children; she will save up the necessary money for this.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first time that Norma accesses an MFP loan so she is excited since her plans are defined and she wants to make them a reality.  She needs your help.  Norma will use the money to buy sacks of peas, ollucos and potatoes as well as pay to transport them to Lima and thus start a new business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":214.76,"image":{"id":902997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sacks of peas, olluco and potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-24T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":145.7},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":209.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":217.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":233.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":236.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":248.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":254.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":271.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":278.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":289.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":302.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.64,"local_amount":145.7,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":148.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835931,"comment":null},{"amount":78.44,"local_amount":209.17,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":213.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245690,"comment":null},{"amount":81.68,"local_amount":217.82,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":222.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-28T22:59:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":350540,"name":"Humberto De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 47 a\u00f1os de edad, Humberto es un hombre trabajador y luchador que desde hace 5 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 iniciar su labor como ventero ambulante de comidas r\u00e1pidas, actividad que viene de herencia familiar ya que su padre toda la vida se dedico a esta actividad. \n\nHumberto dice estar muy feliz con su negocio, ya que el puede manejar su tiempo, en semana trabaja de 10am a 6pm, y los fines de semana seg\u00fan el trabajo extiende su jornada laboral hasta las 10pm.

He considers it more profitable to plant peas and potatoes, which have demand in the city and he brings them to the city of Lima for mass consumption. \r\n\r\nThe main problem he points out are the low and high prices. \"There are months when the price falls and I only recover capital, but yet we go on,\" he adds.
