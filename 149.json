Her family makes their living on tofu. Before, they did not have enough money, so every day, the couple could only make 5 kilogram of tofu to sell, making from 400,000 to 600,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. After joining the TYM fund, they started borrowing money and tried to expand the production, producing from 10 to 15 kilograms of tofu every day and raising from 10 to 20 pigs. Their income now reaches about 2,000,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. Mrs. P. plans to make the next loan of 9,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to buy 800 kilograms of tofu supply. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Duc Tran, Kiva

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy thread and kanga","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970772,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886989,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436249,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130521,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027318,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613334,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010417,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232728,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664544,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T19:26:30Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74155,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira was born in 1976.

This is 31-year-old Ashura M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children between the ages of seven and 15 years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because the child's parents do not take care of her. Ashura has been running a tailoring shop and selling clothes since 2007. She purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing, mainly for women. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Ashura currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 250 USD in order to buy more stock for sale. In the future, she plans to expand the business. Ashura thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.

The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is an expressive textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Geraidina works at the business for eight hours per day,five days per week. Geraidina currently earns about 325 USD from her business.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.

Out of that happy marriage came three robust children who work hard in agriculture despite their young age. Catalina is a homemaker whose husband is a farm worker. In order for her husband to go to the farm, she has to wake up at 5:00 am and prepare him a good breakfast, which consists of coffee and cassava. At noon, she takes him his lunch and helps him whenever necessary. On Fridays, she picks green plantains because she has noticed that this is a lucrative business, and she makes more money then when she sells plantains in her farm.

from Tanzania! This is 30-year-old Caroline S. from Mwanza. She is married with two children ages four and six years old. Additionally, she supports one dependent because she is an orphan. Caroline has been running a pharmacy business since 2005. A pharmacy in Tanzania is traditionally a small store that has many glass shelves on which a variety of medicines are displayed, from antibiotic soap to malaria medicine. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Caroline currently earns about 30 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 425 USD in order to buy more medicines to sell. Caroline thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To buy more medicines to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T20:50:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970776,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886993,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436253,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130525,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027322,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613338,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010421,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232732,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664548,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105279,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T22:42:23Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74169,"name":"Fredy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fredy tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene una hija de 2 a\u00f1os, actualmente esta viviendo en la casa de sus padres.

When she lived with her husband, they worked on other people\u2019s farms.  Years passed, her husband got bored, and left her.  This was motivation to work even harder to support her children and, now that they are older, they all together plant their crops on rented land.  From this, she earns enough to pay for the technical education of one of her children who is studying at a private institute.  Likewise, three months ago, she started a small grocery store and when she goes to work on the farmlands in the afternoons her children are in charge of the store.  Her little store is taking small steps and she has great hope that it will grow.  This is her first loan with MFP.  Today, with these funds, she will invest in the purchase of candy for her store since there would not be enough for groceries right now.

This is 28-year-old Nurat S. from Mwanza. She is married with one four-year-old child. Nurat has been running a maize flour business since 2006. A typical maize business is a stand on the side of the road where maize is often piled high in baskets. Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before purchase and can specify the exact amount they would like. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture because maize is used to make one of their staple dishes, ugali, which is made solely of maize flour and water. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Nurat currently earns about 200 USD a month from her business.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase maize in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T21:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970777,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886994,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436254,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130526,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027323,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613339,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010422,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232733,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664549,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105280,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-20T00:20:07Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74176,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A pesar de sus 61 a\u00f1os, la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda sigue siendo m\u00e1s que un paradigma para su familia por su perseverancia y valores intactos.

","en":"27-year old Vilma is a single mother. She lives with her parents and five children, and she is also responsible for looking after her parents. Vilma is a very enterprising woman. Many years ago she worked in her neighbours\u2019 fields, but now that her children are in school, the money she earned didn\u2019t cover the family\u2019s needs. So two years ago she started a business buying and selling bananas, and everything is going well. Twice a week she goes to the fields to buy bananas, and on the other days she works on the ripening process. On these days she gets up at 4.00 in the morning so there is enough time to submerge the bananas in the appropriate chemicals and then wraps them in plastic to protect them while they ripen. She doesn\u2019t wait for wholesalers to come and buy them, but instead she takes them to the market herself and sells them to the highest bidder. This is the first time that Vilma is seeking a loan from MFP. The money will provide her with increased capital to buy unripe bananas; she is planning to invest all the money in her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":225214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy unripe bananas for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-26T01:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":850.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011309,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-26T03:59:25Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:51:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74194,"name":"Los Responsables Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LOS INTEGRANTES DEL GRUPO LOS RESPONSABLES  REPRESENTADOS POR LA SE\u00d1ORA MIRIAM SON GENTE QUE  SE CONOCEN YA QUE RECIDEN EN EL MISMO BARRIO.

A year ago she planted bananas and 5 years ago she planted citrus fruits, which she is now harvesting.  Six months ago she worked as a facilitator for the government program PRONAMA, teaching adults to read.  She enjoyed teaching, which is why she now wants to be a teacher for another government program and, at the same time, continue working her small farm (chacra), which she wouldn't leave for anything.  She is a new MFP client.

As a child he worked on a small farm (chacra), then migrated to Lima looking for other opportunities other than agriculture.  At the time he did not know his partner was pregnant, which is why he returned to help raise his daughter.  Three months ago his family came together, wife and daughter, and their first goal is to build a house out of umiro (a local plant from which the leaves are used to build walls) so as to be able to live on their own and, in the future, Michael plans to add on a sundries store.  The challenge right now is a lack of money to expedite the construction of the house.  This is the first time he has applied for a loan with MFP.

However, their businesses are located in the main market of Masaya. They are from a humble background. They were not given the opportunity to attend school and they first learnt how to carry out rural activities, such as agriculture and the rearing of domestic animals. 5 years ago, Mrs Reina started her business selling vegetables from home, selling what she grew. She then realised that by obtaining a loan from ADIM, she could invest more money into her business. As a result, she formed the solidarity group JOSE and obtained a loan, which allowed her to set up a pitch in the main market of Masaya and which therefore enabled her to increase her profits. She began with a capital of $1,500.00 and now she manages 2 loans. One is a working capital loan and the other relates to her self-esteem. Both the loan from ADIM and the solidarity group JOSE have together helped Mrs Reina to overcome her fears and insecurities and have helped her to feel capable of confronting life. Her vision for the future is to expand her business and to obtain her own premises with better security. With the aim of fulfilling her dream, she proposes to continue repaying her instalments and intends to try and save money, so that she can improve her house and expand her business.         <br

A few years ago, he became a day laborer - working for others in their fields and being paid by the day. Unfortunately, this was not enough to support his family, so he turned to the Banco de Confianza for a loan. He invested that loan into raising chickens and did well for himself, using his profits to plant potatoes and strawberries in an unused portion of his property. With God's grace, he was able to harvest a healthy amount of both potatoes and strawberries. With this next loan, he will plant tomatoes, for which he will need to purchase seeds, fertilizer and pesticides.  Mauro's 4 little children help him in their spare time, and he hopes to be able to give them an education with the earnings from his garden.

There are many expenses and she gets up very early to start work but as she also has to do the chores, that reduces her time to sew. She has been sewing for the last ten years, on her own initiative and with her own funds. In order to buy more fabric and materials for sewing, she started with loans from Afodenic.

She feels grateful for ADIM, not only because of the loans, but also because of the trainings she has received these past four years, which have allowed her store to grow and flourish.  She hopes to purchase more merchandise, especially now that we are approaching Christmas.

They are from the Capul\u00edn community on the highway to Granada.  They are humble people, yet entrepreneurial.  They have a primary school education, which allows them to be very expressive.  They have convinced the superintendence of the market to assign them a wooden stretch to sell their products, which they purchase for each season and sell retail at the Masaya market.  Their loans have been invested in the purchase of seasonal fruits and vegetables.  The loan with ADIM has given the group the opportunity of improving their standard of living, as on top of investing in their businesses, they have been able to use their profits to improve their houses.  Mrs. Lissette is the mother of two children and does not count on support from their father.  She believes that thanks to ADIM, she has been able to face life and cover the basic, necessary costs for her family.  Also, it has permitted her children to go to school.  She hopes that her children will not be touched by her same fortune, and therefore she is most determined to further her children\u2019s studies.  This communal bank has been trained by ADIM in business administration, which has allowed them to be successful in the repayment of their loans. Their dream is to obtain a farm for them to plant fruits and improve their profits.  In order to do that, they have decided to save and manage their money.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lucia Franzese, Kiva

Mrs. Nhy S. is a 52-year-old widow with two children who are all attending the local school. She hopes to increase her income and improve her living conditions with this new loan. \r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

is a 28 year old woman engaged in dressmaking, specializing in making school uniforms and gowns.

She has been married to a booking officer in a bus company for almost a year.<p>\r\n\r\nAt present, she has three employed sewers and has engaged in a private school providing on-the-job training for its students. She earns a daily net income of Php 450.00 (approximately US$9.00) that she uses to sustain their needs. Her vision is to expand her business in order to provide more employment opportunities in the community. Aside from the quality products she manufactures, she also offers minimal and affordable costs that attract plenty of customers. With the increasing demand of her sewing services she needs an additional piping machine, fabrics and accessories for mass production of t-shirts.<p>\r\n\r\nShe had been an active leader and member of ASHI for five years. The experiences she has had have helped develop her confidence in managing her business. When she first joined ASHI, she just used a manual machine without any employed help. Using the successive loans from ASHI, she was able to accumulate several more machines, like high speed machines and an edging machine.<p>\r\n\r\nAdora dreams that three years from now, she will own a

Her life partner works in trucking. Sabina's wish is to advance her business and start a shop and provide the right conditions because their house is very small. Due to circumstances, she has converted her house into a seamstress shop and, as a result, she is not able to unwind from her work. Her friend, Candida, has offered support so that she can get ahead with her business. Her other wishes are to maintain an open hand of friendship like Fundacion Leon 2000 that continues to finance her commercial needs so that she can overcome the difficult situation of progressing in her work.<p>\r\n\r\nHer economic activity is seamstress work such as making uniforms, dresses, and women's and men's trousers. She has had this business for ten years. She started it working with another person, but later, she decided to sell in the Chinandega market. Then with her earnings, she decided to buy a machine with which she could fulfill orders for uniforms. This loan will be used as working capital to buy raw materials like fabric, thread and zippers for different orders that her customers make. She says that she is thankful for the funding and the different organizations that facilitate this type of loan assistance.<p>\r\n\r\nCandida Eufemia M. T. is 51 years old. She has a domestic partner and six children. Her daughters are 32, 30 and 17 years old and her sons are 22, 28 and 25 years old. Her life partner does not work. Among her goals are to establish a store in her home and to start a stronger and more productive business. In this manner she can maintain the credit available with Fundacion Leon 2000 and capitalize on economic activity. Her other goals are to provide better earnings for her family since she has not achieved her goals due to the current economic state of the country. Her desires are to give her daughter a future so that later she can pursue her studies and have a successful career.<p>\r\n\r\nCandida has worked for twenty years selling products that were shipped like maize, jicama seed and peanuts. She began her business through the interest in entering this type of business since she was searching for a way to support her family.

What they value most is the culture of savings that is encouraged through the Unity of Microfinances.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":226257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase and sales of agricultural products in the main markets of their district","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Accha - Paruro - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2008-11-23T20:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta Line ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lazara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomas Timoteo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Florencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":13200,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1990.04},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2069.65},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2152.44},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2238.55},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2328.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2421.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":644.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":670.28},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":697.1},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":724.98},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":753.98},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":784.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1314.79,"local_amount":4059.69,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T14:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4064.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9907657,"comment":null},{"amount":697.1,"local_amount":2152.44,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-16T08:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2155.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14832270,"comment":null},{"amount":724.99,"local_amount":2238.55,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T09:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2241.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20369262,"comment":null},{"amount":754.39,"local_amount":2329.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T10:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2332.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27059003,"comment":null},{"amount":783.73,"local_amount":2419.99,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T11:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2423.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35951320,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-18T23:18:39Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T11:44:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74579,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard G., not yet married, received schooling through Senior High and has sold men's clothing at Ewim in Cape Coast since 2002.

She has 5 children who now support themselves. She has her own home, equipped with basic services. She sells corn once it has been processed and also has a car that she uses to transport people. This gives her income during the week. On the weekend she sells food. She has 12 years of experience in these areas, and they have been a good source of income for her single family. There is a lot of competition in the activities she is involved in, but thanks to her experience she has been able to capture a lot of the market and therefore has high demand. This credit will be used to repair her car, because it was in an accident. Since the car is a principal source of income for Margarita, it is important that she repair it.

Prior to that she sold American-style clothing but she assures us that vegetables are better and she can feed her family with this business. The client has various colleagues who offer the same products, her colleagues have larger stands and the success of her business is her persistence and responsibility as she has a steady clientele. The client will invest in her vegetable business, buying large potatoes (560 BS), small potatoes (200 BS), onion (140 BS) a case of tomatoes (60 BS) and other items (78 BS). The client will invest in these items as there isn\u2019t any more room for vegetables and she rotates her merchandise after a certain period of time.
