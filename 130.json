She borrowed the first loan of 2,000,000VND and used it to purchase animal feed and livestock to raise at home. Thank to her experiences from many years raising livestock, her business is now very developed. Beside utilising the family's garden and pond area, she obtained loans to buy more pond area to raise fish. As an active woman, Mrs. Mung wants to improve her family's standard of living, so everyday she also sells pork in various markets in Ha Noi city with her son. This business is also a significant source of income for her family. This time, she would like to borrow 18,000,000VND (1,100USD) to invest in raising livestock to further improve her family's financial situation.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her.

In the case of corn, he dries it and later threshes it, puts it in sacks and stores it for future sales. The process for planting his fields is first to prepare them with organic fertilizer, later using his plough he sows them, and afterwards is the period when he irrigates and applies fertilizer and insecticides, if necessary. All this is to insure a good harvest.

Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lesbia Elvira F. Mart\u00ednez\r\n37 years old\r\nQ3665,- \/ $500\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a young woman who, just as so many others, struggles to find her way in life.  Perhaps more than for others, her work plays a major role in helping her find her life's direction.  This woman is called Lesbia and she lives in the Guatemalan City Prison called  Santa Teresa. <p>\r\n\r\nI get the opportunity to meet with Lesbia when I accompanied Sergio Roberto Gonzalez, the director of FAPE, on a special day organised by FAPE to teach the women how to run a business.  Entering the prison is relatively easy, and the two stamps on my arm ensure that I can rejoin the outside world.  Obviously for the women here, it is another story.  This facility is a place where most of the inmates await their trial.  The slow process of the courts means that some of them have been waiting for more than four years.  Sitting together in the prison's enclosed patio area, we begin our chat and Lesbia tells me that she has been there for four years and one month.<p>\r\n\r\nBefore she began her time in this facility, Lesbia was living in Guatemala City.  Her family is from a nearby area called San Miguel Pet\u00e1pa.  She is trained as a teacher and has a 20-year-old brother.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn prisons in Guatemala, like many other developing countries, authorities supply only the most basic essentials.   Beyond shelter, food and water, the standard of a prisoner's life depends on what their family can provide them with.  Items such as clothing, books, and toiletries are all given by the inmate's families.  Because Lesbia's mother is ill at the moment and cannot visit her, she has no one but herself to rely on.<p>\r\n\r\nLiving circumstances within the prison are far from easy.  The women live in a single room with 24 other inmates.  The beds are made out of concrete.  In order to give a semblance of privacy, the prisoners hang sheets between adjacent beds giving each woman has a solitary square metre of her own.  Currently there are about 225 people live in the facility.<p>\r\n\r\nLast year, students from the University Rafael Landivar (URL) came to the prison and to teach interested inmates how to run a small business.   There were courses given in all kinds of business related subjects, such as credit control, writing a business plan, etc. Inspired by the course, Lesbia decided to make all kinds of small decorative items for books and pens by hand.  These charming products gave an outlet to Lesbia's talents and a focus to her life while incarcerated.  But it has become more than that now.<p>\r\n\r\nThe course organisers successfully petitioned the facility to allow inmates that performed very well in the course the chance to sell their wares at a market stall in the university for a day.  Lesbia was one of those chosen.  She tells me with pride how she was able to sell all of her goods, and that it proved to her how well her business could perform in the outside world.  The experience has inspired her to pursue her entrepreneurial dream and more than just a distraction from her mundane existence in jail.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Lesbia is holding a big bag of her products that she hopes to sell at a local church.  I am amazed when she mentions to me that it has taken her only two days to produce so many items.  There's nothing else to do in prison, she admits; there are no books, no televisions, and so days are very long there.  She focuses her entire life upon her business.  In order to work in the evening times, Lesbia had to seek special permission for the use of a lamp.  She's even allowed to own a scissors, a necessary item for her work.  Privileges like these are only available to women that show that they are dedicated entrepreneurs and participate in all of the offered social programs.<p>\r\n\r\nLesbia initially sold her products to friends that came to visit her in jail.  However, since the facility recognises Lesbia's responsible behaviour, they now approve her non-family visitors more readily.  This has proved very useful, as Lesbia is now able to use these visits to send out her products to clients as well as to receive materials.  Many of her suppliers she has never met in person, only over the phone.  It is certainly a challenge to run her business from this facility, but she is able to manage.<p>\r\n\r\nBefore her business, Lesbia didn't believe that she was very creative. Now, however, she actively seeks out inspiration for new product designs wherever she can.  Some of these designs shall be part of the new selection of products that she hopes will be ready in time for Christmas.  Lesbia realises very well that her customers like her products, but in order to maintain their interest, she needs to offer them something new and keep her products fresh.   A brilliant commercial thinker, if you ask me.<p>\r\n\r\nI ask Lesbia if there is something that she wants me to write in her story, and she tells me that she wants to thank FAPE for giving her this life-changing opportunity.  She tells me how she knows that funding women in prison may have been seen as a risky investment and that FAPE was the only organisation who thought it worthwhile.  Having FAPE believe in them has given her back a large part of her dignity and self esteem.<p>\r\n\r\nTowards the end of our interview, when I ask Lesbia about what her dreams are, she becomes a little emotional.  She explains to me how being in prison can change a person's way of thinking.  She feels that she has grown, spiritually and as a person.  Her biggest wish now is to be able to have a little shop somewhere in the city where she can sell not only her own products, but also the products of people that find themselves in situations similar to the ones that she herself faced.  Her experiences have taught her much about herself, she tells me, and she hopes that the lessons that she has learned she will be able to teach to others. This is what she is working for now: the new life she wants to build after prison and the credit will help her with this!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":202188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Souvenir Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy materails for making handicrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Guatemala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2008-10-04T20:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lesbia Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-18T22:22:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3665.96,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":407.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":420.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5313259,"comment":null},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":407.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":420.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395025,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":1221.99,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1262.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086824,"comment":null},{"amount":0,"local_amount":0,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086825,"comment":null},{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":219.12,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-26T08:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":226.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594379,"comment":null},{"amount":192.32,"local_amount":1410.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-23T09:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1456.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96942028,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-04T22:22:00Z","paid_date":"2009-12-23T09:04:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":64818,"name":"Adwoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adwoa A. is 50 years old, married and the mother of five children, two of whom are currently in school.

Her purpose in life has been to see her children become professionals and with the sacrifice of her work they have done so. Her biggest dream is to be able to give her children more dignified living conditions. Her greatest wish is to be able to arrange her home which has a small shop that offers products for daily use and consumption such as milk, rice, sugar, cooking oil, beans, soft drinks, eggs, detergent. This business has existed for 23 years and has helped her advance her children. She worked as a teacher but eventually was unable to teach due to her age, so this business became an income option for the family. With her severance pay she established this small shop. To date, it is her largest source of income while counting on the moral support of her husband and institutions like ours that have supported her projects.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

beternak babi. Dengan lahan yang terbatas Ibu Made Mertini membuat kandang sederhana yang bisa menampung 2-3 ekor babi. Walaupun kandangnya terletak berdekatan  dengan rumah tetangganya namun limbah dari kandangnya tidak sampai mengganggu lingkungan sekitarnya karena ternak dan juga kandangnya dirawat dengan baik. Hasil dari memelihara babi penggemukan tersebut dipergunakannya untuk mencukupi kebutuhan rumah tangganya baik itu untuk di dapur maupun keperluan lainnya seperti biaya pendidikan anaknya yang berusia 14 tahun dan saat ini masih duduk di bangku SMP. Walaupun hasil yang diperolahnya dari usaha ini tidak terlalu banyak tapi hal ini tidak mengurangi semangatnya karena usaha ini sudah ditekuni cukup lama dan terbukti bisa membantu menopang kehidupan keluarganya. Ibu Ni Made Mertini saat ini mengikuti program ternak babi yang dikelola DINARI dengan jangka waktu pinjaman selama enam bulan dan pembayaran akan dilakukan kembali setelah periode pinjaman berakhir, dan selalu berharap usahanya bisa lebih maju dan keuntungan yang sebelumnya hanya Rp 300.000 per ekor bisa bertambah sehingga kehidupan keluarganya bisa lebih sejahtera lagi.","en":"Living in the suburb with dense population does not hold Made Mertini to run pig raising business. Having limited space, she build a simple pigpen for 2-3 pigs. The pigpen is closed to her neighbour house, however the waste is not a problem as she cleans the cattle and the pigpen regularly. The income from raising fattening pig is used for meeting her daily needs and for education of her 14-year old child in junior high. Although the profit is not that much, but it is proved to be able to support her family livelihoods and, therefore, inspire her to keep the spirit for the business. Made Martini joins pig raising program of DINARI with 6-months loan term and repayment is started after the loan period is over. She hopes for the development of her business and for her profit from USD 33 per pig to be increased for the prosperity of her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Iman Persada Madaze, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":202376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy piglet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-09-13T19:40:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made Mertini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-27T21:17:29Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":1666666.66,"processed_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-23T08:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1742030.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308580,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":1666666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1742030.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849803,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":1666666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-17T08:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1742030.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080630,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-13T21:17:29Z","paid_date":"2009-04-17T08:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":64884,"name":"Mrs. Ro Mao Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Our village bank which consists of fifteen members is located in Thmey Khmer Village in Kampong Chhnang Province, and they plan to use the loan for maN. different purposes.

With the readily available animal feed in her house and her experiences in raising livestock, the project was very successful. The subsequent loans were also used to invest in rearing pigs. Now, Mrs. Tam's family has a pig sty up to standard with about 20 pigs. Beside raising livestock, Mrs. Tam also sells vegetables in the market everyday. This also brings about a stable income for her family. Mrs. Tam has a daughter who is working with a stable monthly income of 2,000,000VND (about 125USD) so every month, Mrs. Tam receives financial support from her daughter. Wishing to improve her family's standard of living, Mrs. Tam would like to borrow 15,000,000VND (900USD) to invest in raising livestock.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh

Currently, beside rearing pigs, Mrs. Y. also sells vegetables in the market. Besides working as a construction worker, her husband, Mr. Manh, helps her take care of their two young children so that Mrs. Y. has more time for business. Her family's monthly income is now 3,000,000VND (about 187USD). As such, their financial situation is improving and Mrs. Y. is able to send her children to school. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150USD) to invest in raising livestock and selling vegetables, so as to increase her family's income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese

He is 51 years old, married and has 4 children.  He has a vocational education and is an accountant by trade.  He works at a secondary school.  Since his salary is very low, Tuhtashkul has been involved in agriculture.  He plants corn on his plot of land.  He utilizes part of the harvest as food for his domestic animals and chickens, and sells any excess at a local market.  Currently, Tuhtashkul wants to purchase corn and wheat seeds needed for fall sowing.

Khut Khum Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twelve people in Chrey Kaong Lich Village in Kampong ChhnA. Province make up the village bank loan and they plan to use it for multiple purposes. Mr. Khut K. is the village bank president and he is a palm juice collector who gathers palm juice to process into palm wine or sugar. Aside from this business activity, he is a fisherman in the local lake. His wife, Mrs. Suong Mom raises three cows and two pigs. Since her cows and pigs grow bigger every day, Mrs. Suong  does not have enough money to buy grass for the cows and pig food for the pigs. Thus, Mr. Khut K. decided to ask for a loan for his wife. Mr. Khut K. is 26 years old and the father of a four year old child who is too young to work or attend school.  Mr. Phon S. and Mr. Chea P. could not come to take the loan but their wives came to take the loan instead so they are in the picture. \r\n\r\nTwelve members have end-of-term loans and these members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main policy because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":202459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy grass for the cows and pig food for the pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-09-12T21:50:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khut","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Un","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kheun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chea","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Huot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-27T01:05:16Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T20:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":102972.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5285912,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":51486.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899001,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":51486.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14823154,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":102972.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27048636,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-22T07:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":72080.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52905712,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-24T08:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":92675.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63127798,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T11:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":247134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73551261,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-13T01:05:16Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T11:33:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":64920,"name":"Dioum","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"M.

He will use the loan to purchase fertilizer, to pay for a tractor rental and to pay for fuel.

He is 40 years old, married and has 5 children. Sobirjon has a high school degree and has been growing wheat for more then 5 years for a living. As the market price for flour is very high and bread is the main food staple in Sobirjon's household, he has been growing his own wheat. In years when he has a good harvest Sobirjon is also able to sell some of the grain to his neighbors, which supplements the family's income. Sobirjon wants to ensure a good harvest and would like to purchase good quality seeds for the next year. He is planning to pay back the loan in the next 10 months.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

He is 25 years old, single and has a high school degree. Mahmadali lives with his retired parents. He owns a small plot of land where he grows wheat every year and then sells the grain at the local market. By growing his own wheat he can also avoid buying flour at the market. Currently Mahmadali wants to take out a loan to finance the purchase of quality wheat seeds and fertilizer to assure a good harvest next year. He is planning to pay back this loan in the next 12 months.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

She did not continue her studies because she got married, but she later studied cosmetology and folk art.  She has 3 children and lives in the El Provenir district in Trujillo Province in the La Liberdad department.  This businesswoman works in folk art, both needlework and leather, which she began as a hobby.  She also sells cosmetics and clothing, and works for campaigns.  \r\n\r\nShe has been a working member of the Manuela Ramos Movement.  Her sister recommended her to the communal bank ESPERANZA DEL MA\u00d1ANA (Hope for Tomorrow).  She decided to participate in this bank because the doors were always closed to getting a loan elsewhere because she needed her husband, Aval, as a guarantor.  This was a challenge, because being a capable person, she was able to cope and even get ahead without anybody else's help.  \r\n\r\nWith the first loan of $1000 that she received, she bought threads, needles, knitting needles, and weaving needles.

She has been in business ten years, and has a home in the Monte Tabor neighborhood with her 23 and 24 year old children who support her.  Maria has been a tough woman now that she can't count on the support of her children's father, but it has not been an obstacle in earning herself an honorable living.  When she started selling enchiladas, she did it looking for an alternative income and started it with her own funds.  She wants to invest this loan in buying products to make more varied dishes to offer to her customers and get new ones.  Long term it is to improve the infrastructure of the business, grow in customers as well as capital, to be able to always be with her children and to help with her parents who are still alive.<br
