This business, which he began two years ago, has, in a way, significantly enabled him support to his family of three kids and his wife. Banard lives and operates his business from Kihihi. He sells his foods in food markets in the district. It goes without saying that his business has not lasted so long but Banard says it's been worthwhile, especially in terms of bringing in some income for him.

She lives with her parents and her sister, Lisbet, who is 22, in their own house located in the Palcamayo area. For five years she has prepared bread, initially distributed in the different outlets in her area but now she has her own bread shop where, in addition to selling bread, she also sells cakes and pastries. With that her business and earnings have grown and this helped her a lot to be able to help with the university education expenses of her sister, who wished to study nursing. However, to continue to support her family, she had to enter into agriculture, helping her parents in planting peas, potatoes and vegetables. And on weekends, she supervises the crops and negotiates what has been harvested in the city's central market, sending vegetables to make money. What Jocelinda likes most is helping her family. Her greatest wish is to see her sister successful and her parents calm. Now she wishes to buy products for her bakery, as well as acquire her own land and, in this way, be able to farm a greater quantity of vegetables to meet the demand that the wholesale buyers generate and for that she will have to hire workers to help her to take care of future crops.

Heriberto has been in the waste management industry since 1990, when he and his brothers opened a junk yard.  In 1994, they acquired a metal crusher, which launched Heriberto into the metal recycling business.  Shortly thereafter, he started Comanche Auto Recyclers, which he has been running ever since.\n\nFor years, Heriberto went from junkyard to junkyard with his crusher and trailer, looking for salvageable vehicles.  If he saw a vehicle with metal he could use, he bought the car from the junkyard.   If not, he went to the next place, spending fuel and time on the road.  A few months ago, Heriberto changed his business dramatically by moving to a new location where he could weigh scrap metal onsite.  Now, people who want to get rid of their vehicles take them to Heriberto, saving him the hassle of traveling with all of his equipment.  He pays for the vehicles according to their weight, with the price fluctuating according to the price of steel.  He crushes the cars, loads them onto his trailer and then he transports them to a metal recycling center in Seguin, Texas (roughly 40 miles east of San Antonio).\n\nTo make this expansion possible, Heriberto rented a new location where his business can operate, bought a portable building that serves as his office and a used scale for weighing cars.  Being hit with all of these expenditures at once strained Heriberto\u2019s cash flow.  Because Heriberto buys all of his cars in cash, it is important that he always have cash on hand.  This loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana provides Heriberto the operating capital to continue buying cars as he navigates his business through this transitional period.\n\nBefore relocating his business, Heriberto worked long days that often did not finish until 8 or 9 PM.  His new business model allows him to work fewer hours so that he usually finishes work by 6 PM.  As a father of six, he appreciates the opportunity to spend more time at home with his family.  Heriberto has two flatbed trailers that can store up to 18 crushed cars each.  He has two employees, one of whom is his son.  They currently make one trip a day to the recycling center in Seguin, though they hope that once word catches on of their new location, they will be fully utilizing both trailers.

They have 5 children, 3 of whom are still at primary school. The other two are older and have jobs. \r\nCarlos has a well-stocked store, where his wife Rosalina works. \r\nThey began this business with some money that Carlos received as severance pay from a previous job.  \r\nIn addition to having the store, Carlos also works as a security guard for an Itaipu-based firm. With the money he earns from this job, he is able to cover the household costs and provide for his children's education. \r\nHe explains that the only way of being able to develop the business is through loans, since it is very difficult to secure sufficient capital through other means. It is for this reason that he has requested the loan. He is a very responsible person, who wants to succeed. He has a jovial spirit and is enterprising. There is a little doubt that he will be able to achieve all the goals he has set himself. \r\n

They are now in their 2nd loan cycle, and they are working together in the program with a lot of cooperation and solidarity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the businesses that each one of them has, they also develop joint activities in order to raise funds with the objective of having sufficient capital within their group.  They also help each other to reach their goals, especially with regard to supporting their families.\r\n\r\nJustina is the president of this group, and she managed to start up a small store where she is increasing her inventories with her earnings and with the loans that she obtains.  In addition, she also sells beef stew that her husband brings from Asuncion monthly.  Justina wants to have this loan so that she can buy more products for her store, such as: bread, fruit, vegetables, grains, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":774829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy meat, fruit, vegetables, grains, drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ybycu\u00ed","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2011-05-23T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sinthia Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andreza Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Barbara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Blanca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Justa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evangelista ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mirtha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":7856988,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1309498},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1309498},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1309498},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1309498},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1309498},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1309498}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":329.17,"local_amount":1309498,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1310083.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211232413,"comment":null},{"amount":329.16,"local_amount":1309498,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1310083.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216511204,"comment":null},{"amount":329.17,"local_amount":1309498,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1310083.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221675567,"comment":null},{"amount":329.17,"local_amount":1309498,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1310083.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227044545,"comment":null},{"amount":329.16,"local_amount":1309498,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1310083.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232805490,"comment":null},{"amount":329.17,"local_amount":1309498,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1310083.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238616605,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T16:14:02Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":300921,"name":"Camila Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Camila de 38 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona peri-urbana en la Perimetral (lugar muy humilde, las casas del sector est\u00e1n rodeadas de un estero donde pasan los barcos con cargamento pesado) de Guayaquil.
