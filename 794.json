This is how she has generated the income to support her family for five years and she wants to expand her business because there is a good amount of demand to satisfy.\r\n\r\nIn her desire to keep achieving her goals, Magdalena is asking for a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for the sum of 1,000 nuevos soles.  She will use this money to buy feed so her animals will fatten better and grow faster, which will allow her to achieve her goal of giving her family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1012166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T20:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T20:10:08Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":113.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":120.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":122.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":131.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":139.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.98},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T21:35:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397025,"name":"Marites","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marites is 31 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She began her business because her family was in the business and being that she was not interested in going to school, she therefore decided to join her mother in the business until she got married to another businessman who gave her money to start her own business. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Yeabu has already received and successfully repaid her previous loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy 10 Catton slippers and 41 set of jeans improve her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 900,000.

She was so dependent on him for survival as she didn't learn a trade, so as a result, she went to her elder brother who advised her to go in to business. Her brother gave her some capital to start the business so that she can also be supportive of her husband. Since then, she worked hard to improve on her capital up to this time. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.

The training was conducted by a university student who offered these trainings within her practical volunteering activities in the framework of her studies. After the training sessions the microfinance institution Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer set up groups of borrowers, and this group stands out because it is particularly well organized and responsible. Right now the group has added two new members from Banco Mujer, who had not applied for previous loans.

Working seven days a week and twelve hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,700,000 every month from this business. \n\nShe would like a loan of SLL 5,000,000. Marie has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to increase her stock. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 350,000. In the future, Marie plans to expand to the centre of town, setting up three shops and to educate her children to university level. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1009221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To pay for African dresses, bags, soft drinks and cooking utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T06:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T06:30:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T13:20:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397175,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes for resale.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T06:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T06:30:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":296.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":316.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":329.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":339.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":352.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":364.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":364.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T18:32:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397176,"name":"Martha S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha is 36 years old and lives in Buchanan.

At the young age of nine she had to start selling vegetables to help her mother raise money for food and school fees. She took everything she learned from her days of selling vegetables and opened her own hair salon as soon as she completed high school. She ran the salon for six months but had to close it down because she was not making any profit. She then started selling chickens and it was through running this business and interacting with different people that she learned about an organization that conducts HIV\/AIDS training. She underwent the training and became a qualified HIV\/AIDS care giver. In April 2011, while still working as a care giver, she got an opportunity to start running her own mobile money transfer business and took it. \r\n\r\nHaving run her mobile money transfer business for close to 10 months now, she says she loves it because it gives her an opportunity to interact with different people and she gets to learn new things every day. She believes her community benefits from her business because they are able to send money in a quicker and safer way. \r\n\r\nCurrently Martha only has working capital of $200, which is not enough to serve customers who want to send larger amounts of money and so she has no choice but to send them away. Martha is in dire need of this loan so that she can increase her working capital. She is confident this will give her more customers and more commission. \r\n\r\nIn her video, Martha is being interviewed by a representative from mobile transactions. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1012341,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2548,"youtube_id":"mdU7spnfcvc"},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To increase her working capital so she can serve customers who want to send larger amounts of money","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Katete","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T07:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T07:50:03Z","loan_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":26000000,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":26000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-29T12:54:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396117,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carlos is 21 years old, single and he currently shares an apartment with two of his friends.

Strathmore is one of the leading private universities in Africa offering quality education to its students, which is why I chose to study here.\r\nThis loan will enable me to focus on my studies without the uncertainties of being sent away from school in the course of the semester because of my fees balance and not being allowed to sit for my examinations. The assurance that I will complete my course without any financial setbacks will give me peace and help me concentrate on my classwork.\r\nUpon graduation, I want to venture into the insurance field, especially life insurance and micro-insurance, where I want to apply my acquired skills and also get to learn more on the same. I hope to see an increase in the level of penetration of insurance in Kenya to a high level, probably higher than that in South Africa. Embracing of micro-insurance, especially among low income earners, is one of the best dreams I have for my country. The benefits of this will go a long way in providing a better lifestyle for most people and will also reduce the money spent to cover losses compared to if they had not been insured.\r\nThis loan will help me complete my studies without financial constraints and at the same time enable my parents to educate my other siblings.

I come from a family of 8, I am the fourth born, my three siblings have only high school qualification,one is in high school and the youngest is in primary school. I am the only one pursuing university education. I am in my first year taking an undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Business Information Technology at Strathmore University.\n\nI completed high school with the help of well-wishers in 2010. My excellent performance and improved skills in basketball led me to be called for by the UNICEF Talent Academy where I was exposed to many clubs including an outstanding, high-level performing institution that is Strathmore University. I applied for a sports scholarship, and luckily I was awarded 75% of my tuition fees. My father is having difficulties financing the remaining 25% of the tuition fee.He is not financially stable, and besides that my small business cannot help me raise this money in a stable way.\n\nAt the end of my degree course I dream of being an IT specialist, majoring on networking. Besides that, I wish to have a chance to get my basketball to a professional level, because it has been the virtue of my assistance to my academic progression and it\u2019s my motivator in my struggles.\n\nThrough the Strathmore media I came to know about KIVA and felt the urge to apply for the 4 year maximum tuition loan to help me out of my struggle to raise the 25% of my fees.  With that at hand, I had to consider the thought to seek this loan to help see my dream come true."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
