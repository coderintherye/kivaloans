He was able to recover and today sells his produce to customers and also offers it to new clients, as he needs to increase his clientele.  His business has gradually been improving.  He usually works by himself, but during harvest time he needs his family to help.  His plans for the future are to increase his production of cocoa in order to satisfy his most demanding customers.

For a living they produce milk and live in Itocta Sud in a rural area of the city of Cochabamba. \r\n<p>\r\nElisa is a hardworking woman since her husband suffered  an accident on his tractor and was gravely hurt. It was so severe that he could not walk and had to attend treatment and physical therapy. Elisa was always there to support him. She would wake up very early to work and deliver the milk to the milk company to make enough money to pay for her husband's rehabilitation. She also worked so that her children not leave school since she and Remberto considered their education as something important.  She and Remberto never gave up. They were able to succeed on their own since neither Elisa nor Remberto's parents helped them.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy soy peels. She will buy a soy truck which will be used for her livestock for the next six months because during first few months next year there is a scarcity of soy. With this she will be able to increase milk production since she collects between 15 and 17 liters per day. This will allow her to receive the highest possible amount of profits each month. \r\n<p>\r\nAlong with her husband she dreams that their children be able to finish school and be able to have a career. They themselves were not able to finish school meeting at an early age and getting married. Mr. Remberto works very hard to offer a better future for his children and wife. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Garza, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":606460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle feed.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and food vending. Her husband, Lemuel, who is 42 years old, works as a carpenter and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 8 to 19 years old. Liza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14000, which she intends to use to as revolving capital for her fish-vending activities. She plans to continue to save for future home repairs and the education of her children. Liza D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Labugon, Brgy. 1, Ilog, in the southern part of Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard selling oysters and fish in her community and the surrounding areas, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10000. Gloria needs PHP 16000 to sustainably expand her oyster and fish vending activities. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She previously borrowed PHP 14000 to fund her vending operations, and since paying it off, she now wants to add a little more to her revolving capital so that she can increase her income capacity. Gloria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. Gloria is shown in the accompanying picture with the raw oysters that she sells in her community. Her hometown is known to have some of the best-tasting oysters in the island of Negros.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

This time, for her twelfth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save for the future economic security of her family. Mary Joy B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

Ella es una mujer que vive  en Malambo con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus  tres hijos de 20 a 25 a\u00f1os.\nDesde hace 25 a\u00f1os cuando vivi\u00f3 en Santa Marta, aprendi\u00f3 todo lo relacionado con la belleza femenina y  por eso cuando se traslado a Barranquilla,  pens\u00f3 inmediatamente, en crear una alternativa de ingresos, haciendo lo que a ella mas le gusta ;  as\u00ed fue como hace 15 a\u00f1os inicio su negocio de realzar la imagen de belleza, comenzando con clientela de Soledad, Barranquilla y Malambo,  ofreciendo como productos a domicilio , el corte de cabello, tinturado, alicer y peinados, gradualmente sus clientes,  le ped\u00edan asesor\u00eda respecto a los productos que deberian usar para conservar el cabello hermoso,  tal como Nuris se los dejaba, y fue entonces que se le ocurri\u00f3 la idea de venderle a su clientela,  productos de belleza logrando ingresos adicionales importantes y tambi\u00e9n ofreciendo el servicio de aplicaci\u00f3n de los mismos. Gracias a sus esfuerzos en el negocio  y el de su esposo, hombre tambi\u00e9n muy trabajador,  han logrado educar a nivel profesional a sus hijos y ahora est\u00e1n bien empleados.\nEste es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con su credikiva comprar\u00e1 productos de belleza como shampoo, desrisados, aliser, masajes y protectores de brillo; con las anteriores  financiaciones ha logrado incrementar sus ingresos, mejorar su vivienda  y sobre todo  incrementar sus oferta de servicios. Su sue\u00f1o se enfoca en  el reacondicionamiento del local y mejoramiento de su vivienda;  su mayor desaf\u00edo actualmente es la lluvia, porque le dificulta  el servicio a domicilio, porque  con los fuertes aguaceros que est\u00e1n ocurriendo diariamente, los arroyos se crecen,  paralizando toda la ciudad porque resulta peligroso salir de casa a responder a los clientes.\n","en":"Nuris Mercedes is a beautician. She has increased the services she is able to offer, including assessing clients and selling beauty products and providing hair cuts to compliment the appearance of women, men and children. She is a woman that lives in Malambo with her three children aged 20 and 25 years old. \r\n\r\nWhen she was 25 years old and still living in Santa Maria she learned to provide beauty services to women, so when she moved to Barranquilla she immediately thought about setting a business to generate an income, a business doing something she enjoys. Fifteen years ago she set up her  \r\nbusiness selling beauty products, door to door, giving hair cuts, dying hair, hair styling for events et. Gradually her clients sought out her advice on the products they should be using to have healthy hair, keeping it the same way as when they left Nuris' shop. She started selling to her clientele beauty products, engaging another source of income. She continued to offer her beauty services. Thanks to the efforts she invested in her business and her husband's efforts, a very hard working person too, she has granted her children to have higher education. They are all enjoying careers now. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan accessed through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With her loan she will purchase beauty products such as shampoo, streaks, massage oils, conditioners etc. With previous loans invested she has seen improvement in her profits, and she has improved  \r\nthe quality of their house. She has also increased the services she is able to offer. Her dream is to remodel her beauty shop and carry out some home improvements. Her greatest challenge now is facing rainy days because it becomes difficult for her to provide her services at their clients' homes. The rains come in terrible storms that come almost daily. The rivers swell and the entire city is paralyzed because it is dangerous to go out of the home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

T. (1) is a 61-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa.  Minh is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 08.03.01 Dong Ve (08.03.01 Dong Ve).\n\n\nMinh is married and has no children.  To make a living, Minh works in a family member's business making and selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Minh has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 1,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2010, Minh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Minh is requesting her first loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  She is requesting a loan of 4,248,000 VND, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Minh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1.  T. T. Nga (2) is a 34-year-old female who is requesting a 4,248,000 VND loan to support her service-based business.\n\n\n2.  B. T. Hang (3) is a 31-year-old female who is requesting a 4,248,000 VND loan to support her service-based business.\n\n\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\n\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nMinh N.

Bernadita A. is 45 years of age, married to Epenito, a driver, and is blessed with five children, two of whom are now adults while the other three are still in school. She is from the barangay of Pisaan within Bonifacio municipality, a part of Misamis Occidental region on the island of Mindanao. Bernadita raises pigs for butchering. She also receives support from her husband as a driver. She\u2019s been in this business for almost a year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009 Bernadita joined PMPC to gain access to its financial services. She is an active member of PMPC under the PDP-LP program, a microfinance program that reaches out to rural communities. Bernadita successfully repaid a loan amount of 7,000 PHP. She is now requesting a loan, her third from PMPC, of 14,000 PHP to be used for additional capital to buy and sell pigs for butchering. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family, in particular to meet their basic needs, to save for the future, for loan repayments and for her children\u2019s education, insurance and possible expansion of her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma D., age 26, is from the village of Salimpuno. She is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are each responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAlma is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Alma plants, harvests, and sells assorted crops. Alma has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Alma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She wished to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Alma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizer for the farm. Alma is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to invest in cassava plantation. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Alma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":606600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For cassava plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Salimpuno, Sapang Dalaga Mis.

Y., age 51, is from the village of Guinabot, Sapang Dalaga. She and her husband have two adult-aged children. To make a living, Debbie owns and operates a grocery store, where she sells household items such as canned goods and other daily basic needs in the local community. Debbie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Debbie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Debbie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Debbie is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used toward the expansion of the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Debbie from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for the future and for her children's education.

Marlyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,300 PHP a month. Marlyn wants her children to finish their college education, which is why she wants her business to become progressive and successful.\r\n\r\nMarlyn joined ASKI last year to gain access to financial services. She wanted to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Marlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her products for sale. Marlyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Marlyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas of the country. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

By working hard in her handicrafts (basket weaving) business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 6,000. Lebina is now borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more materials for business.  This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lebina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and assures their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

F. is a married woman who lives in Rizal Street, South Poblacio, Naga City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a food vending business, a sari-sari (general) store and an electronic-reloading business. Her husband Sotero F., who is 40 years old, works as an electrician to earn his living. They have five children who are 8 months to 15 years old. \r\n\r\nAnaly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Analy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 75,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to buy stock to sell to continue to save for her children's education and improve their standard of living. Analy F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahnaz has lived in Lahore in a two-room brick house with her family for the last 10 years. Lahore is the second largest city in Pakistan. A very talented Shahnaz owns & operates her embroidery business at her home. She makes embroidered dresses for her neighboring clients. Earlier, she made embroidery dresses for her relatives but now she is receiving orders from her neighbors as well. She is good at her art and knows many embroidery techniques. She crafts beautiful embroidery designs on clothes, which are admired by her customers and this gives her encouragement to work with more dedication and enthusiasm. She earns a good profit by completing orders. The earnings allow her to pay for the household utilities. Her husband appreciates her for her helping and caring nature towards the family.  \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of six children. All of them are illiterate and couldn\u2019t get an education due to financial constraints. Her husband is a government employee and her eldest son has an embroidery shop in the market where he embroiders dresses and contributes financially to his family. He started learning this art from his mother at an early age. \r\n \r\nShahnaz has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her son\u2019s business. With the loan, her son will buy embroidery items such as beads, colored thread and clothes in bulk, which will enable him to make more embroidered dresses to display in his shop to attract customers. Shahnaz is hopeful that, by investing the loan money in her son\u2019s business, her son will be able to expand his business and increase his income as well. This is her first loan and she hopes that it will be a profitable experience for her family.  \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady who is slightly raising her hand is Shahnaz.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":606731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy

 A. is a 49-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating her pig fattening and weaving businesses. She lives in Barangay Bog-ot, Argao, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $185. \r\n\r\nCresencia is now borrowing 12,000 PHP so that she can purchase pig feed and vitamins.  This will be her 12th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Cresencia hopes to raise her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. is a married woman who lives in Barangay Casay, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living through her general store and pig fattening businesses. Her husband, Simplicio G., is 61 years old. They have seven children who are between 19 and 32 years old. \r\n\r\nAurelia  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aurelia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $210, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital to buy stock for the store and vitamins for the pigs, so that she can continue to save up for the future and improve her businesses. Aurelia G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

To make a living, Nenita owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Nenita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nenita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Nenita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Wenifreda is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Wenifreda from HSPFI.

A. is from the village of Lurugan, Valencia City, Bukidnon.

To make a living, Rocelyn owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Rocelyn has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Rocelyn is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Rocelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her husband Jesus E., who is 50 years old, works as a businessman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 14 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nCirila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cirila has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to add to her capital to purchase a fishing boat and to fund her oyster culture activities so that she can continue to save up for future, for family and business. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture shows Cirila on the beach pointing to her oyster culture site. Cirila E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Marcela aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $230, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides for the farm so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Jocelyn A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Evelyn hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

joined ASHI in 2007, a KIVA partner in the Philippines. When she received her previous loans from Kiva, she invested the money in her business and later expanded the business by ordering a stock of ingredients to put into production. \r\n\r\nNow on her 4th loan, she has requested 16,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business ventures. She is positive that her business will grow since she already has regular customers requesting orders at home. Tita is still hopeful that by growing her business of making and selling \u201cbandi\u201d (a sweet peanut delicacy) her profit will increase as well. Then she would be able to support her children\u2019s education and hopefully will have a better career in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cBandi\u201d is one of the most popular delicacies of Antique province and tourists buy it as a present. Demand for this product is increasing as the province industrializes. Tita wants to have a large amount of capital to increase her production, thus meeting the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a permanent space in the marketplace where she can sell her \u201cbandi\u201d to earn a much larger income. She hopes to have success in a business that can provide her a good life that is moved out of poverty. Tita is grateful to ASHI for offering her happiness in life and group support in achieving her goals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":606788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been selling sweet potatoes for 3 years. She started her business with around $20 provided by her husband. She displays her merchandise at a sales place on the street in the Kasika district, No. 1 Lualaba Avenue.   This loan will enable her to buy 200 kg of sweet potatoes for $40 and increase her sales.  The remainder of the loan will be used to pay for her children\u2019s school expenses and to save for a rainy day.   Sometimes she finds rotten potatoes as a result of poor preservation. She wants to change her business and buy a knitting machine. For her family, she wants to be able to easily send her children to school. Client Kungwa Wilondja M.

With her other business she sells charcoal. Previously she cooked flat bread (chapati) and fried dough (maandazi) for sale. In addition she sells fresh water as another source of income. Dzame\u2019s major challenge is seasonality. Her most difficult time of the year is the rainy season when the charcoal supply is low but the demand remains high. Thus she is unable to satisfy her customers' needs.  \r\n\r\nShe decided to join Yehu to access loans to boost her business.

She lives in the suburb of Guayaquil. She started out with a computer in her house offering maintenance and doing graphic design. However, she had so many customers that she had to move house so she could have better premises for the business.

Her business is located at the front of her house, where she attends to her customers with great care and attention.  She starts her day very early in the morning, since this is when the most people frequent her establishment.  What she likes most about her business are the sections of fruits and vegetables, which gets more turn-over than any other items in her store.  As such, she is always re-stocking this section.

She strives to help her family financially and to prepare a better future for her daughters. She sells medicines and weaves caps, sweaters, socks and gloves from wool. She works with her hands using a crochet needle, as she has been doing since she was 10 years old. \r\n\r\nEsperanza realized she needed to diversify her business to increase sales and therefore increase her income. She then gathered friends she has known for more than 15 years to form a group since she strives to help not only her family but also her village. Each of the ladies from the group is dedicated to a different activity such as selling fruit, raising animals, growing beans and tomatoes among others. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is a single mom, and has a 14-year-old son.  She lives with her father in Viloma, a canton of the Sipe Sipe municipality, province of Quillacolla, 20 km. from Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nFor the past fifteen years, she has worked in dairy, since her mother died.  She also sees to her father\u2019s well-being, as he is elderly and can no longer work.  That\u2019s why she takes care of him, for she is the youngest sibling, and the only woman in the family.  Maria is a hard-working woman who gets up very early to milk the cows and deliver milk to the station in the area.  She also farms, growing onions and carrots in certain seasons.\r\n\r\nShe is devoted to her work but does not neglect her son\u2019s upbringing, and consistently supports him in his schooling.  Her dream is for her son to enroll in the university to complete his studies.  She wants him to study medicine and thus be able to help the people in the community where they live.  It is an isolated area whose inhabitants struggle to make a living.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to purchase cattle and thus increase milk production and deliver more to the station.  This will enable her to increase her earnings and provide a better future for her son and make her father more comfortable in his old age.  He always worked for her brothers and for her, and that is why she strives to be better each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":607128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de una cabeza de ganado lechero","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-09-26T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657927,"comment":null},{"amount":301.34,"local_amount":301.34,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":301.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262148,"comment":null},{"amount":298.66,"local_amount":298.66,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":298.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479303,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-29T07:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232770071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-26T12:53:21Z","paid_date":"2011-10-29T07:46:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":234409,"name":"Kory Chuyma Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cKORY CHUYMAS\u201d es el nombre de la asociaci\u00f3n comunal que est\u00e1 por iniciar su noveno ciclo en el centro focal Santiago II.

In addition, the women of this group are hardworking so the name is appropriate for them.  The group meets in the town of Tepeapulco in Hidalgo and consists of eleven members.  They have participated in five loan cycles with CrediCom\u00fan.\r\n<p>\r\nIrma A. M. is the president of the group.  She is 31 years old, in a common law marriage, and studied through high school.  Irma works as a merchant and has four children (ages 4, 7, 8, and 10).  Her husband paints houses and buildings, but since he has very little job security, she decided to start a business to help with the finances and raise the quality of life for her children.  A year ago, Irma started a business selling Mexican street food.  Thanks to the loans she has received while working with CrediCom\u00fan, she has been able to increase her production as well as her sales.  Sra. Irma says the responsibility for her success lies with CrediCom\u00fan as well as with her group.  She experiences the \u201cgive and take\u201d relationship that the Institution has with all of the groups and each of the members.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda Elena Ram\u00edrez B. is the group treasurer.  She is 39 years old and earned a technical degree.  Mar\u00eda Elena is in a common law marriage and has two children.  She sells groceries and has eight years of experiences.  Approximately a year and a half ago, as a result of the economic downturn, Mar\u00eda Elena learned about the services and advantages available from receiving loans.  She saw this as an opportunity to restart her business using the loans she received.  Her customers have noted the tremendous growth in her business because she now offers products that she did not have previously and are not being offered by any other businesses in the area.  \r\n<br

She travels to several places to sell her jewelry, such as private and public businesses, where she shows them her merchandise and sometimes leaves them on credit and later returns to pick them up.  The business is good for her despite the fact that she does not earn much because sales are difficult.  She is satisfied since she can work in this business during her free time without neglecting her family.\r\n<p>\r\nNancy is requesting the loan to purchase jewelry because she does not have enough varieties to sell to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva
