She is 40 years old, married, and mother of 5 children between the ages of 10 and 25. Only the 3 youngest are going to school.\r\n\r\nIsabel moved from Chibuto to Namaacha, a village that borders Swaziland, when her father was transferred to work on the waters of Namaacha. After their arrival, Isabel did not have the opportunity to study because her father gave priority to the boys, and the girls had to work on the \u201cmachamba\u201d (small agricultural holding). She began going across the border to get contraband products to sell, but this became too risky so she switched to selling sacks of peanuts and beans purchased in Swaziland and sold in the capital city. Isabel does this until today. She makes 3 trips per month and purchases 20 sacks each trip \u2013 10 of beans, which cost 1,320 MT each, and 10 of peanuts, which cost 1,500 MT each. She is able to resell them for 1,600 MT and 1,900 MT each, respectively. Her monthly profit is 5,000 MT a month, but she is not able to save any of it because, besides being responsible for her children, she also supports her mother who lives in the capital with 1,000 MT a month, and has some construction being done on her property. Isabel found out about Hluvuku through a friend and Hluvuku client, Marta Zucule. Isabel is asking for a loan of 10,000 MT so that she can increase her stock. \r\n\r\nThis is Isabel\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku, and her first through Kiva. Her first loan of 5,000 MT was used to increase her business, which she repaid without any problems. She is requesting 10,000 MT to strengthen the sales of the same products. Isabel is confident that she can repay her loan before the due date so that she can request a new loan that she will put toward buying a pickup truck or van that will make selling her products in the capital easier. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jill Haring, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":311176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buying and selling grain","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-05-07T06:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":527.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":551.3},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":576.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":602.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":629.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":657.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":687.7},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":718.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":751.28},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":785.24},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":820.73},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":857.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":896.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":937.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.61},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.61},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.45,"local_amount":1078.76,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1098.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44577732,"comment":null},{"amount":21.61,"local_amount":576.22,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":586.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52971097,"comment":null},{"amount":22.59,"local_amount":602.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":613.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190924,"comment":null},{"amount":23.61,"local_amount":629.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":640.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618805,"comment":null},{"amount":106.73,"local_amount":2846.26,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2897.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056653,"comment":null},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":1281.39,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1304.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971600,"comment":null},{"amount":50.51,"local_amount":1347.04,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1371.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816592,"comment":null},{"amount":61.45,"local_amount":1638.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1668.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708744,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T16:13:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":105169,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Married with five children, Patience G. is a forty-four-year-old petty trader.

She is 42 years old, married, and the mother of 2 children. The oldest is 22 and the second, who is in school, is 20. \r\n\r\nHelena moved from Gaza to Namaacha, a village that borders Swaziland, when her husband was transferred to work as a border guard. Several years later her husband lost his life, leaving her with 2 children to raise. Life was very difficult for Helena, so her son in law gave her some money to start her own business. She began by obtaining empty cans in the capital and re-selling them on the border in exchange for lingerie, plastic sandals, and baskets. These she took back to the capital to re-sell, and start the process again. Once her business grew, Helena decided to change because it was very tiring. In 2000 she was able to obtain a stand in the central market where she sells primary goods. Her best sellers are peanuts (1,320 MT a sack), tomatoes (500 a box), coconuts (500 a sack), and oil (450 a box), which are acquired in Swaziland. She travels twice a week because besides selling at the market she also sells at the informal Shoprite market on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Helena\u2019s monthly income is 2,500 MT, and she is able to save 500 MT a month. She supports only her grandson. \r\n\r\nThis is Helena\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku, and her first through Kiva.

She is 30 years old, married, and mother of 2 children. The oldest is 10 years old, and the second is 6. Both are in school.\r\n\r\nElisa moved from Maputo to Namaacha, a village that borders Swaziland, with her mother right after she was born. She began her schooling only when she was 12 because she had always been very sickly. When her mother could no longer to pay for her schooling, Elisa did her part to help by selling a few products at school during recess time, and at night to the night-school students. \r\n\r\nWhen Elisa got pregnant with her first child, her boyfriend was unemployed. Seeing that she was good at business, Elisa\u2019s mother gave her some money to start her own. She sold primary goods, and was eventually able to build her own house. Some years later she began selling beauty products, but had to stop when a law went into effect saying that students were not permitted to braid their hair. So she began selling shoes and sarongs purchased in the capital. The shoes are purchased for 35.00 MT and sold for 50.00 MT, and the sarongs are purchased for 50.00 MT and sold for 75.00 MT in this district. Elisa travels to the capital twice a week because, besides selling her wares at the central market, she also sells at the informal Shoprite market on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Her monthly income is 3,000.00 MT, and she is not able to put any of it toward savings since she is having some construction done and takes care of her brother in-law that lives in her home. \r\n\r\nThis is Elisa\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. The 70,000.00 MT she is requesting will be used to increase her stock now that winter is approaching and many clients are requesting shoes.

She is 40 years old, married, and went to school until the 7th grade.  She is the mother of one son who is studying at the Pedagogical University in the Capital.\r\n\r\nLaurentina left Zavala with her parents who were serving in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, since her father was an official of the local government.  Having arrived in Namaacha she did not have access to schooling due to a lack of documentation for transfers from one school to another so she went without.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and she became pregnant with her first and only child who was rejected by her boyfriend who alleged that the child she hoped to have did not belong to him.  Laurentina became desperate and asked for help from her father who gave her some funds.  She began her own business of selling empanadas on the black market.  With the funds collected she began to prepare food on the Swaziland border where there was a large flux of people.\r\n\r\nToday she is the owner of a food stand.  Every day she purchases 10 chickens at 100 each, 5kg of stomach at 50 per kg, and 5kg of beef at 95 per kg.  Each plate has a price.  For example, the chicken plate is 40MT per plate, and she can make 7 plates per chicken.  The beef and the stomach do not have exact numbers because it depends on the quality of the meat.\r\n\r\nShe sells 1,500MT on the normal days and 2,300MT on the busy days, but she is only able to save 500MT due to the expenses of her son, who is at the university, and her 2 employees.  One of her employees helps her in the stand earning 800MT, and the other helps at home earning 700MT monthly.\r\n\r\nThis is Laurentina's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  This 10,000MT will be used to purchase more products since she is ready to open another food stand in the informal market, Shoprite, to resell staple products.  She is confident that she will be able to pay off the loan before the stipulated time and request another loan in order to furnish her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

Mr. N. T. is a 57-year-old village bank president. He is a farmer who hires a 1-hectare field to cultivate rice on. In this plantation, he has a problem because he earns too little income to support his family. In order to improve his income, he decided to ask for a loan to hire a piece of land to cultivate rice on and he would use the rest of money to purchase fertilizer to support his field. His wife, Mrs. Van Ran, is a housewife.  Mr. N.

Mrs. Srey Tuch C. did not come to take her loan but her husband did, so he is present in the picture instead of his wife.<P>\r\n\r\nOne member in this group is an end-of-term borrower and the rest have monthly payment loans. E-o-T borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Mr. Song S. is the 49-year-old village bank president. He is a farmer who hires a plot of land from the other people to cultivate rice on. In this plantation, he has an obstacle because his field is infertile which has a bad to affect on his crop. In order to solve this problem, he decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field to make his crop more productive. His wife, Mrs. Chum Srey Neang, is a pig breeder. Mr. Song S. has eight children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while five others are enrolled in the local school, and the remaining one is too young to work or study. <P>\r\n\r\nFour members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Naume is a very determined lady with a dream to achieve more in life. She is thirty-six years old and married with three children, aged six, ten and seventeen. All are in school with only the eldest in secondary school, while the others are in the primary section. Naume also helps to care for an orphan with responsibility for the child\u2019s general upkeep. She has a grocery business which she started in 1998. From that time until 2002 she was sharing the stall premises with a friend, until she became independent. Some of the goods she sells at her stall are green bananas used for making local dishes, tomatoes, greens and other fresh produce. Although Naume is succeeding with her business, she is usually faced with a few challenges: she has to search for good produce from village to village; she needs to be aware of the variation in demand for her produce; she has to shop at night for produce because it has to be displayed in her stall very early for her customers. Naume is grateful that her stall is strategically positioned in Bushenyi main market because as a result, she is able to generate a weekly profit of $56. Her success also comes from the fact that she sells good quality produce. The loans have helped her always to have enough stock for her customers and still supply good quality.

In the course of improving the quality of their service and expanding their businesses, the group members decided to join Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization IMCEC. They already benefited from one group loan from IMCEC, and they repaid it without problems. They intend to use this loan to rebuild their food products stock, in order to better serve their customers. The products are retailed, for cash, at the grand market in Thi\u00e8s.

He buys bread in large quantities from a large Kinshasa bakery and makes deliveries to customers.  He has worked fifteen years as a baker.  He started his first business in 1985 by opening his shop, which developed through 1990.  With the events that followed, such as the political instability and the wars, he had to change his business several times according to the circumstances.  It was in 2004, after closing their company (a bakery), that he decided to start a bread business by becoming a member client in another large bakery in the city with an initial $50 in capital. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, Jos\u00e9 has many customers and his business continues to prosper.  The loan he received enabled him to increase the number of orders for bread, so as to satisfy customer needs each morning and evening.  His business brings in a profit of about $300 a month which helps him to support his family.  Currently, his capital amounts to $650. \r\n<p>\r\nJos\u00e9 is 45 years old, married, and the father of two children who are 8 and 12 years old, and both attend school.

This is located around 22 km north of the capital city, Santo Domingo. This community does not have nearby facilities like schools or hospitals and is quite isolated, which means the members of this group must travel long distances to restock their inventories and sometimes must sell outside their communities to make better profits. \r\nMany of them knew each other from before, as some of them go to the same church. Fatima F., who happens to be the group coordinator, is also the leader of the Ladies' Group at church. She is married and has 3 children. Fatima sells bedding items like quilts, sheets, and pillowcases. She sells them either individually or by sets. The sets, because they have more pieces, can be sold for a higher price. Sometimes, when she sells a set, she must do so on credit and the customer will pay her back in two or three payments. This presents a challenge for her: she must make sure her customers pay on time so she's not late with her loan repayments. \r\nFatima was not able to complete primary education. She wants to give her 3 children the chance to go to school and study everything they want. \r\nPlease help us support these entrepreneurs through this Kiva loan.

He is married and has seven children.  All of his children are doing well.  The older sons have their own families, and from time to time assist him.  Olaberdi studied both teaching and bookkeeping in college.  He works in a school as a bookkeeper, but he has not received his salary since the beginning of the year.

However, her salary is very low, and this is why Rahbaroy and her husband are involved in livestock feeding and sales.  She also has a large plot of land at home where she planted cucumbers and tomatoes.  Rahbaroy plans to can the vegetables from her garden.  Rahbaroy\u2019s father is a long-time client of ours.  He obtains financing for his animal husbandry business.  He is also the one who advised his daughter to increase her livestock headcount while livestock market prices are low.  Rahbaroy now owns three cows, one of which is pictured here.

They have various businesses, among others selling cloth, high quality \"pagnes\" (lengths of brightly colored African print cloth) and damask fabric, fruit, firewood, dyed products, etc. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this new loan they expect to buy 3 wagonloads of firewood, 7 bolts of \"pagnes\", 5 outfits made out of damask, 6 stalks of bananas, 10 baskets of fruit, 20 cloth suits and 4 packs of coloring and ingredients for doing dyeing. They buy their goods at the market in Bamako, in M\u00e9dine in the town of Sikasso and surrounding neighborhoods. <P>\r\n\r\nThe merchandise is sold in the various markets of Sikasso and out of their families to a clientele composed of men and women, mostly for cash. They do their dyeing in their families' homes. They each expect to make an average monthly of 22,500 F CFA of which part will be used for family needs and the rest reinvested in their businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nThe ambition of some of the women of the Danaya group is to be able to buy a lot on which to build a house; other members would like to start up businesses on their own. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":312205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of various articles for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":508.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253945.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020239,"comment":null},{"amount":254.18,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242995,"comment":null},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678774,"comment":null},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112607,"comment":null},{"amount":254.15,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028172,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T16:02:40Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":105610,"name":"Kikiafu 1 Lanyaro Teddy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"L.
