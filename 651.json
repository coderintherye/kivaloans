He is married to Delia. Together they have 5 children, all of them not yet adults, whom they raise and educate in a rented house located in the town of San Pedro de Cajas. Juan's main woven items are tapestries, blankets, hats and ponchos. When he was 13 years old, he started to discover the techniques of weaving and embroidery. Thanks to his persistence and creativity, he sells his weavings for a good price in the city of Huancayo, where he travels twice a month. The times that Juan enjoys most are the days when he sells his weavings, because he sees the concrete results of the days and nights of work and effort. He reports that each month he weaves an average of 18 to 20 blankets, using 5 kilos of dralon (a type of fiber). In addition, he works in the city of Oroya, where he installs pavement on paths and sidewalks, providing him with extra earnings. Now this enterprising young man would like to increase his income by expanding his workshop, investing in buying more looms which will allow him to produce more weavings. He belongs to the \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de San Pedro\u201d [\"Heart of Saint Peter\"] communal bank, and this is his second loan with MFP. He feels satisfied with the work being done there, and he is also grateful for the opportunity for progress that they provide him. Upon receiving his support, he will invest the funds he is requesting in buying 20 to 30 kilos of dralon (a type of fiber), as an investment, and he will use it to weave the beautiful blankets that he makes. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":468.41,"image":{"id":846262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to invest in 20 to 30 kilos of dralon (a type of fiber).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-17T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":154.52},{"due_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":163.03},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":181.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":191.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":201.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":213.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":222.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.78},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.66,"local_amount":154.52,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":155.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350868,"comment":null},{"amount":59.78,"local_amount":163.03,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":164.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851190,"comment":null},{"amount":63.06,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":173.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666366,"comment":null},{"amount":66.53,"local_amount":181.45,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":182.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621522,"comment":null},{"amount":144.25,"local_amount":393.39,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":396.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245379,"comment":null},{"amount":78.13,"local_amount":213.08,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":214.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T21:45:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":326100,"name":"Mujeres Sobresalientes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La formaci\u00f3n del presente comit\u00e9 se inici\u00f3 gracias a una de las miembros, la misma contact\u00f3 con sus vecinas y amigas para formar el comit\u00e9 en dicha zona.

age 47, operates a buy-and-sell business. What she basically does is buy sack bags (colorful bags usually used for shopping) and paper bags from wholesalers and sells them per piece with a little profit. Customers are attracted to buy her bags due to her low selling prices. She earns a minimum of Philippine pesos (PHP) 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Socorro is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of bags to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSocorro lives with her husband Abraham and their children in Malibay, Pasay City. Abraham is a construction worker. Like most Filipino parents, Socorro and Abraham believe that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSocorro hopes to have her house fully paid up as soon as possible because she dreams of being able to provide her children with a good, high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

In addition to her business, Lerma offers rooms in her house for rent as a dormitory. She earns a minimum of 8,600 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month. \r\n\r\nLerma and her husband Maximo have two children and live in Malibay, Pasay City. Maximo is a carpenter. At this time, Lerma is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. Like most Filipino parents, Lerma believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children, particularly as she herself has been an undergraduate. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread, and newspapers for patterns. A portion of the loan will be used to renovate a room to prepare it for rental. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLerma dreams of being able to give her children a good, high-quality education through all her hard work on her business, and hopes to have her own shop for her clothes and curtains. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":846514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy raw

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His mother was not able to provide them with all the necessary things and this is why he started to do business early. He was helping his relatives by selling merchandise and making money. Besides that he learned to grow agriculture crops and animal husbandry. At this time he buys and sells food products. To increase his working capital he has been taking out the loan for the third time. His previous loans gave a big effect as he has grown his business a lot and improved his living conditions. Azizbek wants to get a loan in the amount of $1,500USD to buy agriculture crops.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Therefore, Von hopes to reduce her children's expenses for transportation by using her loan to purchase a motorbike."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":218.75,"image":{"id":846638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"purchase a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Prey Chor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2011-09-02T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Von","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":255500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232825256,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":127750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238637159,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T09:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":127750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244886799,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-16T08:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":127750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250978548,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":127750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257214097,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":127750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263748322,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-03T08:50:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":326249,"name":"Saadat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saadat is the leader of this group.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in a town that is principally characterized, among other things, by thousands of \"Jakarta\" motorcycles that take care of urban transport. This is why, in view of the strong demand for spare parts, he is asking U-IMCEC for a loan of 250,000 francs  to buy 50 tires, 50 inner tubes, 50 tubes of glue, 10 cases of acid and various other spare parts. \r\n\r\nThe profit from the sale of this stock will allow him to support himself and his family.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When her husband passed away it was very hard for her family to come to terms with the cruel turn in their lives. Sadafmo worried how to make enough money to feed her children. She decided that selling fruits and vegetables at the market would provide enough income for her family and has been successful in this business for the last 16 years.

He is age 24 and married. He also engages in a retail shop business to supplement his farming income.\r\n\r\nDominic has requested a loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) from Juhudi Kilimo to help him venture into horticultural farming. He says he will use the money to purchase horticultural seeds and employ farmhands to till the land.

He wants to generate as much income as possible for his own well-being and that of his family.  He also wants to grow his coffee business.  This is the first loan that Rolando has received from FUDECOSUR.  He had never before taken out a loan from a state bank, but FUDECOSUR offered him the loan with easier payment plans and at a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":846968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"with

He makes his living driving passengers around the Ukraine.  He's married with two children: an eleven-year-old son, and a one-year-old daughter.  He has no trouble getting business.  He has regular customers and an excellent reputation.  He's been in the business for twelve years and makes 5000 hryvni.  At present he uses his own car, a 2006 Opel Astra.  It's in great condition.\r\n\r\nVasil needs a loan of 10,000 hryvni to install a fourth generation fuel injection system so his car can run on LP gas, and also do some routine repairs.

His parents are the ones who support him in his education.  Since he was in high school, Jordin has enjoyed computers, and he is very skilled with them.  He dedicates practically all of his time to his studies so that he can continue as one of the top students in his class, as shown by his grades.  He knows his field requires a lot of logic, which is why in his brief moments of spare time he takes the opportunity to play soccer and listen to music.\r\nJordin's greatest dream is to be a professional, competitive graduate.

After finishing high school she was accepted to Kapan's musical academy. Svetlana is a widow and has three children: a son and two daughters. All of her children have their own families and live separately from their mother. Since 1996 Svetlana has been working in retail. She sells clothes, lingerie and shoes at a rented stall at the Kapan City Market. She purchases her inventory every month in Erevan and she works without weekends. Recently Svetlana also started to sell fresh flowers which she purchases every morning from whole-sellers. With the help of her youngest daughter Svetlana can manage both the clothing and the flower sale businesses. Flower sales bring them additional profit and allow Svetlana to financially help out her daughters' families. Svetalana is asking for a loan of 400,000 dram to purchase fall season clothing and shoes before the start of the new school year and to expand her flower business. This is Svetlana's 7th loan and she has always paid back her loans on time. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":338.96,"image":{"id":847039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy autumn season clothes to resell and also to develop her flower trading business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-08-11T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18500},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":19770},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20250},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20550},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20690},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21010},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21610},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21660},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22110},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":22120},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22950},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":23020},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":23300},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":23850},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":24090},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":24460},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":24860},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.9},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.43},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.97,"local_amount":18900,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":19138.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866033,"comment":null},{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":20170,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":20424.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682066,"comment":null},{"amount":56.81,"local_amount":20660,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":20920.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244637518,"comment":null},{"amount":57.67,"local_amount":20970,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":21234.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250853914,"comment":null},{"amount":58.08,"local_amount":21120,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":21386.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263613,"comment":null},{"amount":58.96,"local_amount":21440,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":21710.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404791,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-25T03:38:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":326393,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary sells kenkey, provisions and food items at Abura.

She is married and has four children, ages 5, 10, 12, and 20. All of her children attend school. She has one additional dependent who lives with her: her niece. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Kalaytu established her business doing tailoring and selling football game materials. She gained business experience from her husband; since he is a business man, he coached her on how to run her business. He gave her some starting capital to begin her business. Working six days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about 1,140,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan of 5,000,000 SLL. Kalaytu  has already received and successfully repaid one loan. She will use the new loan to buy wool thread (20 bundles @ 30,000 SLL), footballs (5 doz @ 60,000 SLL), padlocks (20 doz @ 7,000 SLL), and nylon thread (10 bundles @ 30,000 SLL). She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 225,000 SLL.  \r\n\r\nKalaytu is quite sure that this money will help her improve her business gradually. In the future, she plans to educate her children to the university level with the support of her husband. She wants her children to be able to take care of them when they retire. \r\n\r\nThe rainy season is a threat to her business.
