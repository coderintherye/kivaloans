He is married and has 9 children. The family has lived in Shewa district of the Ningarhar province, which is an agricultural area, for a long time. Five of his children are studying in a public school but besides their schooling, they help their father with the farming part time .<P>\r\n\r\nShaal P. has spent 12 years in farming.  Prior to that, he worked as a shopkeeper in his village but the business did not support his family as much as they needed. So P. changed his business and now he is growing different kinds of vegetables on his land.<P>\r\n \r\nShaal is a hard-working man.  He wants to buy some livestock, too, because he thinks that he has a lot of grasslands in his village, and he can pick up good profit from them. He says that if he sells milk and yogurt, he will be able to solve all his financial problems.  Through that he will provide all stationery or other necessary things for his children, also he will able to take care of his family\u2019s health situation.  But Shaal says that all these things depend to his income. Because his current daily income is just about 400 Afghanis ($8), it\u2019s too difficult to make ends meet. Shaal decided to buy some livestock and increase his income through having it, but he doesn\u2019t have much capital on hand for this purpose. So he has requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 Afghanis (US$ 650) from AFSG.<P>\r\n\r\nShaal P. cares deeply about his children\u2019s future, and he dreams of seeing them educated in the future. He says, \"I can accept all problems for this goal, but I will never let them leave off studying.\" Also, he already thanks lenders for their great help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":186385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy some

Her husband is an economist. Muhabbat opened her own general store four years ago because good jobs were not available and she wanted to make sure that her family had enough money to meet its needs. This business is one of her greatest accomplishments because she has always dreamed of owning a business and not having to depend on anyone else. \r\n<p>\r\nMuhabbat's company sells clothing to children and women. From time to time, she travels to the neighboring town of Istaravshan to buy goods to sell. Her younger son, pictured here, helps out in the business. Muhabbat started out with only a few products, but her business has grown larger and more stable. Thanks to hard work by Muhabbat and her husband, her daughter was able to get married last year.

She is divorced and the mother of two children, 28 and 30 years old.  She supports her mother and a granddaughter, periodically sending them money.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe studied through ninth grade, when we stopped and got married.  She lived with her parents during childhood until 1976, when she completed seventh grade.  Then because of a lack of further schooling options she had to move away from her home province to the city of Maputo, where she continued her studies in her brother\u2019s house.  Two years later she met the man who became her husband and the father of her two children.  She lives in her own house.  <p>\r\n\r\nMaria is an employee of the Ministry of Health and has worked in a health center in the city of Maputo since 1999.  Her hours are from 7:30am to 3:30pm, and her salary is 8,000 meticals per month.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan from Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner) and the fourth in her life.  The first three loans were with BIM, the International Bank of Mozambique.  The first loan was for 20,000 meticals, the second for 25,000 meticals, and the third for 50,000 meticals.  They were used to buy a vehicle, repair her house, and legalize (secure the title to) her plot of land.  One of the problems that made her switch to Hluvuku is that the large banks are not flexible with repayments, which prolongs the debt and makes the interest payments unmanageable.  <p>\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a bird house and raise chickens, with a goal of making 1,000 meticals per month.  \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMaria de Lurdes J. tem 49 anos de idade e natural da Prov\u00edncia de Inhambane ao sul de Mo\u00e7ambique, divorciada  e mae de 2 filhos com idades entre 30 e 28 anos  respectivamente.

They named their group Faithful. They are requesting a loan of Le 1,200,000. The former sells ground-nuts and palm-oil during the raining season (between April and September) and \"gara lappers\" (locally dyed clothes) in the dry season (October to March). Like the former, the latter also sells garas during the dry season, and market food and fire woods during the raining season. This is because, during the rains, edible products sell more than clothes.\r\n<p>\r\nRamatu is the leader of the group. She is now 33 and is single with one child. She was born in Makeni and has been in this business for over 3 years now. Ramatu's previous loan helped her a lot. She was able to pay her child's fee for the National Primary School Exams.

The committee\u2019s current goal is to meet with other women in the neighborhood to clean the sidewalks and streets, as well as plant trees on the block, all with their children\u2019s care and wellbeing in mind.<p>\r\nMaria is very happy and proud to be an integral part of a group of women with honest goals such as helping to improve the quality of life in their community by doing community work.  For example, they have organized athletic activities, musical contests and a San Juan party, with the objective of raising funds to increase their savings.  In so doing, the group has planned for any unexpected event that might occur and thus provided the greatest assurance that late payments will not occur.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

She thinks this individual attention is what allows her to do well.

Rosa began working with Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya about a year ago as a part of a group loan.  This is her first individual loan.  She is very happy because she had difficult time securing small loans to buy material to complete large orders.  She is now able to buy the material she needs and continue being successful in her business.  Rosa, her 18 year-old daughter, will finish high school this year.

This group of women, the Nueva Vida group (New Life Group) live in the community of Mu\u00f1uz, Dominican Republic.  The village is filled with Haitian immigrants and poverty is rampant.  This particular group of women chose to participate in Esperanza International's first-ever trial of the program \"40 Days to a New Life\".  The program was dedicated to bettering the lives and providing opportunity to women who had been trapped within the cycle of poverty and prostitution.  These women chose to spend 2 hours each day, for forty consecutive days, learning about the Gospel message, God's purpose for their lives, receiving extra medical attention, and learning basic skills such as sewing, making candles, and making jewelry, skills that could be used to start a new business.\r\n\r\nEach of these women found themselves in the desperate situation of prostitution as a last resort to feed their children.  Through microfinance, beginning small businesses with $150 loans, these women will be able to find a new way to provide for their children with dignity.  Several have decided to buy and sell clothes, traveling to the nearby city of Santiago to purchase shoes, pants, and shirts for resale in the villages.  Others have chosen to open small shops in front of their homes where they are able to sell juice, bread, cookies, or fried foods while still taking care of their kids.  With their first-ever loan, we at Esperanza are confident that the 40 days of training and this small loan will impact these women's lives forever as they truly take on a new life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":187320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy different types of clothing for resale, as well as to buy bread, chicken, oils, and fruits to make juices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-09-01T07:07:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cheli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Myrlanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aloude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":65000,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10833.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10833.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":316.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":317,"local_amount":10844.74,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10904.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360820,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":316.33,"local_amount":10821.92,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10881.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312842,"comment":null},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":10833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10893.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930389,"comment":null},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":10833.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10893.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854963,"comment":null},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":10833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10893.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394245,"comment":null},{"amount":316.66,"local_amount":10833.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10893.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085909,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-01T19:38:11Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:54:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":59042,"name":"Las Mujeres Capacidades Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justa V. is an ambitious 39-year-old woman living in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.

is accustomed to waking up early in the morning to prepare the merchandise for his business, which involves selling packaged rice in the morning market. By 3am Asrop and his wife are busy cooking the rice and various side dishes (meat , fish, vegetables) to take to the morning market. Asrop typically sells the packaged rice in the market at five 5am.  After all the merchandise has been sold he returns home, usually by 9am, to help his wife with the small stall she runs out of their home. The customers are fellow salespeople at the market. <p> \r\nThrough the DINARI foundation, Asrop has access to a loan that can be used to increase working capital so that he can greatly increase the amount of packaged rice that he can sell. From the proceeds Asrop can finance his child\u2019s high school education. \r\n\r\n <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSudah menjadi kebiasaan Asrop bangun pagi-pagi untuk mempersiapkan barang daganganya yaitu berjualan nasi bungkus di pasar pagi. Pukul 3.00 pagi Asrop dan istrinya sudah sibuk mulai memasak nasi dan bermacam lauk untuk dibawa kepasar pagi.
