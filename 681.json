Her son helps manage the store and other family members help serve customers. Eliana decided to open the store because she saw a need to create healthier food choices for people in her community while satisfying their taste buds. They sell natural juices, milk shakes, smoothies, protein, health foods and other nutritional products. Eliana has explained that her greatest successes included overcoming the roadblocks that presented themselves with starting a business, such as not knowing how to operate and finance the health food store.\r\n\r\nEliana will use this loan to purchase food and drink preparation equipment for the store. This equipment will allow a higher volume of customer orders and more variety in the products they sell. Eliana wants her customers to have more choices and carry out orders faster so the store can expand and bring in more income for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":890.61,"image":{"id":871681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for food preparation equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Miami, Florida","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2011-10-04T21:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4260.05,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":178.12,"local_amount":177.5,"processed_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":178.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238529318,"comment":null},{"amount":178.13,"local_amount":177.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":178.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244489139,"comment":null},{"amount":356.24,"local_amount":355,"processed_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":356.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257101554,"comment":null},{"amount":178.12,"local_amount":177.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":178.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263226664,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-12T00:35:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341131,"name":"Ototo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ototo, a hardworking 38-year-old businessman, is married and blessed with two children who are still in school.

Anika moved to New Orleans in 2009 as an Americorp Vista member. She fell in love with the uniqueness of the city and its food and decided that this was where she wanted to be. \r\n\r\nCommissioned by the National Black Social Workers Association in April 2011, Anika officially started Ampelonartist, LLC. The majority of Anika's work is inspired by New Orleans culture and African tradition. \r\n\r\nAnika's new business venture stems from her desire to bring African fashion to the modern woman. Her clothing line, NKWA Urban African Fashion will launch in Ghana this November. Anika considers herself a social entrepreneur who aspires to help families in Ghana by donating a portion of funds made from her clothing line launch to purchase water containers so families in Ghana can more easily access clean water. \r\n\r\nAnika's business is truly a family affair. Her husband, a native of Ghana, is the business agent as well as an artist, and her 13-year-old daughter acts as the photographer and salesperson, promoting the business' many products through social media outlets. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Anika sees her business growing and being self-sustainable. \"Ampelon means vineyard in Greek and I see my business as a collective of artists who will use art to

Tiene 15 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que el transportar sus cultivos desde su comunidad hasta los centros de acopio situados en la ciudad de Santa Rosa, le resulta muy dif\u00edcil. Por otro lado comprar\u00e1 calaminas para renovar el tejado de si vivienda. Con el tiempo, espera juntar el dinero suficiente para comprar nuevas tierras para luego heredarlos a sus queridos hijos. Este ser\u00e1 su 17avo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, sus anteriores cr\u00e9ditos le fueron muy beneficiosos para invertir en su parcela y en esta oportunidad espera contar con el mismo apoyo de ustedes para seguir prosperando.\nCon los 2,000 nuevos soles que solicita, comprar\u00e1 materiales de construcci\u00f3n para poder refaccionar el tejado de su vivienda.\n\n","en":"Benito is from the city of San Miguel.  He\u2019s 42 years old and married to Fortunata, 40.  They have five children.  They live together in their own house in Samugari District belonging to the Ayacucho jungle region.\r\n\r\nThe green fields in his community have been Benito\u2019s life.  It is a very pleasant place to work because he comes from a family that\u2019s been traditionally involved in farming.  He currently has three hectares of land where he grows cocoa beans, coffee and peanuts.  What he most likes about his work is harvesting because that\u2019s the reward for his hard work and dedication.  He\u2019s been in this line of work for 15 years and considers transporting his crops from his community to the gathering centers located in the city of Santa Rosa to be the most difficult part.\r\n\r\nOn another note, he plans to buy sheets of plywood to reroof his house.  In time, he hopes to gather enough money together to buy new fields to then pass down to his beloved children.  This will be his 17th MFP loan.  His previous loans were very beneficial for him to invest in his field and on this occasion he hopes to have the same support from you so that he can continue making progress.  He will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy construction materials and supplies to reroof his house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":883150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building materials and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-29T18:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benito ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-09-30T01:16:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341222,"name":"Leidis Mariela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La joven Leidis Mariela de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, labora como responsable de Administracionn Tributaria desde hace 3 a\u00f1os desempe\u00f1andose con gran honestidad y responsabilidad; esta solicitando su 2do credito con el objetivo de comprar un terreno y en el futuro hacer su casa poco a poco.

She has worked as a computer technician, a Hilton Hotel guest services representative, and a land-lady. In 2004 she started her first business, a transportation service that took children to and from daycare. It was during this time she decided to start  Open Minds Open Hearts Daycare because she witnessed first-hand that many daycares did not stimulate and educate the children enrolled there. As the name of her center suggests, Ashley strives to help children to learn social and emotional skills that will prepare them for school and life in general. \"A good daycare is not just a babysitting service,\" says Ashley. \"I want to make sure that all the children that leave me will do great in school. They are the future.\" \r\n\r\nOpen Hearts Open Minds Daycare opened in 2006 after Ashley obtained her Child Development Associate's degree. The center can hold up to 35 children in three separate classrooms. Ashley's business provides full-time employment to three staff members besides herself. The business is located in a spot close to Ashley's heart: a renovated grocery store next door to her grandfather's house where she was raised. \r\n\r\nAshley is seeking this loan because she wants to boost her Quality Star Rating from three to four stars, helping her to attract more clients and to reflect the center's mission of providing excellent childcare. Ashley will use the loan to purchase child-sized tables and chairs, musical instruments from a variety of cultures to expose the children to cultural diversity, and materials for outside activities to promote active physical play. \r\n\r\nAshley was drawn to applying for this loan because of the person-to-person nature of Kiva. \"What I like about the Kiva loan is that it is people helping people, showing that we are united no matter where we are in the world,\" she said. \"It's great to know that someone supports you and has a connection with you. Versus a bank, it just sees numbers, it doesn't see you as a person, it doesn't see your mission. Kiva is more personal than numbers.\" \r\n\r\nPeople always ask Ashley how she went from computers to childcare. She says she has always loved children, and now her business allows her to spend more time with her two-year-old son, Colby."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200.53,"image":{"id":883164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for age-appropriate furniture, musical instruments, and outdoor playtoys.

They live together in the beautiful tropical forest of Ayacucho, in the town of Santa Rosa, where they have their own house.  She began her career as a carpenter from a very young age, learning this work by watching her father. Her passion for the trade led her to acquire her own tools for finishing wood. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for 22 years, alongside her husband.  Furthermore, she carries out work for schools, institutions and municipalities in her area; making tables, chairs, scaffolding, closets, desks, and other things.\r\n\r\nShe has three helpers, who are responsible for finishing off the job.

Aside from this, Aiden also sews rugs for added income. \r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her business, Aiden is requesting a loan of Php 10,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business.

is Myra.  She is 38 years old and is a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Samuel, a mechanic, and is a mother of two children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMyra operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from the round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, braided quilts and bed sheets, as well as other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Myra's regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her business, Myra is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing this loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMyra dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297.91,"image":{"id":883597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"buy materials to make rugs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-05T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.71,"local_amount":2917,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2939.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571826,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":2332.97,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529376,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":2333.03,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738592,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":2334,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2352.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145831,"comment":null},{"amount":67.7,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2938.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274835,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-05T13:36:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341305,"name":"Aidha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aidha is a 26-year-old woman, married to a businessman.

is a resident of Karajygach, a nice village in the south of Kyrgyzstan. She is 44 years old and is unfortunately a widow.  She is bringing up three children: two sons and a daughter.  Her sons study at school while her daughter is still of pre-school age. \r\n\r\nSeven years ago, with an initial investment of 5000 soms, Parisa started to sell grocery goods. In this way, she earns 4500 soms to meet the family needs. With the profits gained from the trade, she was able to purchase a calf.  \r\n\r\nParisa has saved some money, but needs additional funds to purchase furniture for her home to improve the living conditions for her family.  For this purpose, she has applied for a loan. In the future, she wants to improve her business and provide her children with a good education.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Irine will pay school fees for her kids, and possibly buy livestock. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Kisiwa SHG group will each plant between \u00bd and one acre of maize. \r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Irine is pictured with her group members. Note that of the five women in this group, four are present, as one (Jackline) was being represented by her husband (far right) at the meeting during which this photograph was taken. On the far left is Irine's field officer. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":879019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-10-05T18:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":46550,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-05T20:22:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341353,"name":"Jypara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jypara is a resident of Karajygach, a nice village in the south of Kyrgyzstan.

She doesn't have enough cash to pay for this, so she needs to take out a loan of $1,000 from FATEN. When Eman gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase more groceries and have a better collection for sale. In this way she will increase her income and provide a better standard of living to her family. \r\n\r\nEman is a conservative woman, so her husband Ahmad is photographed in her

He got the idea for his business thinking about the fact that people have to travel a long way to Malindi town to buy retail stock.

Profits from his business allowed him to build a better barn for his animals and help his sons start their own households. Currently Mukan owns a cow, a calf, a horse, 10 sheep, 10 lambs and 5 goats, and his business yields a monthly profit of 17,000 som (KGS). To further enlarge his herd, Mukan has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 106,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional heads of cattle.

In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus, there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do research and write papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a loan for 10,000 PHP, which she will use to buy new computer units and additional LCD screens needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes that her business will last longer and be inherited by her children. Just like other parents, she dreams that her children will be able to finish their studies and have a good family life and business. She never fails to attend the fellowship* every week as it inspires her to grow more spiritual. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is a 29-year-old Lebanese man who lives with his wife and two children in Ain.  Since 2010, he has owned a barber shop and he has seventeen years of experience in this occupation.  He is well known in the whole region for his good business reputation and his welcoming nature.  \r\n\r\nAli is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua to purchase a van that he will use as a school bus to generate extra income for his family.

Thanks to a small plot of land his parents gave him he can go grow cocoa and beans to cover his personal expenses.  He has been involved in this activity for three years and to date his crops have been good quality.  However he does not have the money to hire help for the harvest.  This is his second loan through MFP and he is committed to paying it back on time.  Roly is requesting 2,000 PEN to hire workers to pull the weeds from among the crops.  They will also help at harvest time.  He wants to be able to save enough to increase his plantation and improve his income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":884103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-30T08:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-10T17:42:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341574,"name":"Lidia Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Lidia es una se\u00f1ora extranjera con 55 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera y trabajadora.
