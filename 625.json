Similarly, she wants to be able to have her income grow.  Chicken is a basic food that it is always consumed; and her sales grow a bit more.  There is more demand for her Saturday sales at the Villas del Quetzal neighborhood because on Sundays she rests.  \r\n\r\nDuring the time that she works there are not many people who sell chicken that is fresh.  There were no problems with the loan.  Her biggest wish is to be able to keep selling more and to be able to have a person help her sell in another location.  This will generate more income, and she would also be able to continue giving her daughter the necessities. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.5,"image":{"id":803944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chicken to butcher.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Raymundo, Guatemala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":291.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.59,"local_amount":875.72,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T07:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":876.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227659303,"comment":null},{"amount":37.41,"local_amount":291.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":291.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232785248,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589626,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547687,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758273,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-21T08:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258112851,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263297310,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-01T10:22:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313117,"name":"Adelita De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adelita es una ama de casa, gran una mujer, madre soltera y muy emprendera.  \n\nElla necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de \u20a1500.00, para llevar a cabo el mejoramiento de su casa, construyendo y a\u00f1adiendo a su vivienda un cuarto de pila, para lo cual necesitara comprar zinc, cemento, arena y clavos, entre otras cosas.\n\nElla pertenece a la Empresa de Credito Comunal de Brasilia.\n","en":"Adelita is a home maker, a single mother and a great and very enterprising woman.  \r\n\r\nAdelita needs a loan of \u20a1500.00 (USD $1025) to carry out an improvement on her house.

I never thought I could do it as a real job!\u201d Jennifer, of Jendarling Bags, began designing and producing bags in 2008 in the scarce free time her 9-5 job afforded her. Over the past three years, her hobby has quickly turned into an all-consuming endeavor: she debuted her first collection at the London Fashion Week, at an Ethical Fashion event, at The Hospital Club, and she has been featured by local news sources such as DailyCandy, Treehugger and San Francisco\u2019s beloved local magazine, 7X7.  \r\n\r\nJen\u2019s one-of-a-kind bags are a reflection of her diverse background and interests. With degrees ranging from nonprofit management and business to working at an environmental agency, she drew from each of these experiences when developing her company. \r\n\r\nAs a businesswoman and an environmentalist, Jen prides herself on her business\u2019 commitment to sustainability: various collections incorporate sustainable efforts such as using local, fair trade and organic materials. Many of the zippers are nickel-free, and she relies on mostly reclaimed materials for the bags. All of the leather comes from nearby Napa and is manufactured right here in the Bay Area, supporting local jobs and reducing the carbon footprint inherent in outsourcing. \r\n\r\nJen recently landed a partnership to sell her bags in a high-end retail store. \u201cI was thrilled to land this account because it will open my business to a whole new array of clients!\u201d said Jen. However, when the retailer placed two orders for June and July, Jen realized she did not have the capital she would need to purchase nine different colors of leather to fill this large order.\r\n\r\nJen knew that her bank would not be interested in giving her the small loan amount she needed, nor would it be able to provide her a quick turnaround. Having learned about Opportunity Fund at San Francisco\u2019s Small Business Week, she turned to the local microlender and was approved for a loan within days. This loan of $3,000 will help her to secure the large order with her new partner, affording her the opportunity to grow her business.\r\n\r\nJen takes pride in her fabrics, her mission and her commitment to sustainability. She dreams one day of opening up her own boutique devoted to the same values.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1457.11,"image":{"id":811470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to pay for more materials to make her handbags.

Its people are very kind, cordial and they still practice their culture and traditions.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Mar\u00eda Dolores.  She lives around Cumbe Parish.  She is rejoining the communal band because a while back she was a member of a different one.\r\n\r\nShe is 60 years old but her soul is very young and she has a great sense of humor.  She\u2019s a widow but in her marriage she conceived three children who are adults now.  They are all single and working and help her economically.  With work and sacrifice she managed to build her own house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a small farm animal merchant.  She\u2019s been in this line of work since she was 20 years old.  She works Sunday to Sunday.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the money from her loan to buy animals like chickens, guinea pigs and pigs to continue in business.  Her goal is to continue growing in animal sales.\r\n\r\nThe little boy in the photo who\u2019s seated wearing a red sweater is the son of one of the members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":804022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens, guinea pigs and pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-07-06T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maruja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Gudela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pilar Amparito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmita De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4730,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":473},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":473}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":946,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668268,"comment":null},{"amount":950,"local_amount":946,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227037013,"comment":null},{"amount":950,"local_amount":946,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797576,"comment":null},{"amount":950,"local_amount":946,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608672,"comment":null},{"amount":950,"local_amount":946,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562982,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T05:09:40Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:54:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313142,"name":"Jairo Josue","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jairo Josu\u00e9 tiene 25 a\u00f1os, tiene 2 hijos, su esposa se dedica al hogar.

She lives in her own home with her children and also supports her sisters, who live with her.\r\nShe has never left Maputo.

She uses this money for household expenses and puts some away as savings in her bank account.\r\nShe has never borrowed money from other banks.

It is important to note that his business requires a lot of physical work mainly because he needs to transport the animals from one point to another, crossing long distances under the exposure of the sun. This can cause illnesses and can weaken the body. Nonetheless, Utkir continues to work hard and has now come to IMON International to obtain a loan that will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell in his area.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and 4 children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Amir provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Amir sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. Currently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of 5,000 Somoni for this reason. Amir thanks Kiva for the support that Kiva presents to small entrepreneurs.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has worked as a security guard in the Agro-Alta company for more than a year.  He makes 6,000 meticals per month, which he puts towards his home's expenses.  He also saves some in his bank account in the BIM bank.\r\n\r\nHe has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the institution.  This is his second loan in the amount of 15,000 meticals, which he will use to buy construction materials (bricks, cement, sand, etc.) to do construction on his home.  His first loan was for 10,200 meticals and also went towards his home.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to finish his house to provide better comfort to his family and to improve his business, for which he plans on requesting more loans from Hluvuku."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297.64,"image":{"id":804454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

That belief in her own worth was, needless to say, already playing in her favor, but she needed to back it up with hard work, determination and building relationships with many people including potential money lenders.

The girls have halted their studies in middle school and got started in modeling, while the boy is still in school. The borrower is a good, honest mother who has always struggled for her children. So, she has works in a fish-processing factory located 10 km from her town. The long work hours (ten hours a day) and the long distance compelled her to quit and start businesses involving shoes and personal care products. She has also succeeded in acquiring a taxi cab. \r\n\r\nBut taking care of her ill father, who was hospitalized for almost a year, has drained all of her savings and has compelled her to sell the taxi. She therefore closed all her businesses for a long time and then opened an account at IMCEC in order to start up again. Today, she is requesting a loan of 100,000 francs to stock up on products, especially two dozen of perfume, three dozen of body lotion, and a dozen local shoes. \r\n\r\nThe profits derived from the sale of these products will serve to ensure food for the family, clothing, and beauty products for her two daughters, who are models, and to cover the cost of schooling for her son.

That is how she will work with the loan she has asked for.  \r\n\r\nWhat motivated her to do this activity was her family, since in order to get ahead, she had to look for a way to pay her daily expenses raising her children. She has been with them for 32 years and it has gone well for her.  \r\n\r\nHer only wish is to continue to be supported with the loan in order to keep working as long as God gives her life.

started his publication wholesale business in 1999 to provide both a voice and opportunity for urban entrepreneurs. The business distributes wholesale books, magazines and DVDs to a distributor which ships the publications to large bookstores. The business also sells retail and Damola deals directly with 1,000 small businesses.  Up until now, Damola has distributed four print magazines and a yearly DVD series.  Beginning this month, he is launching a new digital application that will allow his readership to purchase digital magazine content, as well as video and audio content. Damola began developing the digital application and content in March 2010, and at the same time he also invested in rebranding the business with cleaner logos and a wider target audience.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the new digital content, Damola is also expanding into merchant services to exemplify the entrepreneurial focus of his publications.  On his website, he will resell merchant services for his readership and provide links to business-related websites.  He also plans to have a direct marketing campaign and will use the digital application to promote the merchant services available on the website.  \r\n\r\nDamola would like a loan with ACCION USA to advertise his business. He hopes to continue being a guide for the modern entrepreneur through media and technology.

acrylic-plastic fabrication business, Chito Plastics, is a culmination of his 31 years of experience in the plastics business.  Thirty-one years ago, Basilio began his career working with plastics fabrication as an employee at two plastics companies in Houston. Ten years later, he moved to El Paso, where he continued his work in acrylics. After 21 years, his employer in El Paso went out of business, leaving a giant void in the plastics market in his community. Basilio decided to start his business to fill the space left by the closure of his previous employer.\r\n\r\nThe idea to start his business, Basilio says, actually originated from his customers. After his previous employer went out of business, Basilio began to get phone calls from customers who remembered him from the quality work he had done for them. He says, \u201cI had done a lot of work in El Paso and San Antonio, so customers knew me already. They began to call, and that\u2019s what made me realize that I should try to go out on my own.\u201d\r\n\r\nChito Plastics is founded on a simple philosophy of reliable customer service. The company offers literally any plastic product that fits a customer\u2019s needs. Basilio has made products as varied as podiums for churches, museum displays, motorcycle windshields, bulk food containers and aquariums. He says, \u201cWhen I do my work, I do it in a manner as professional and timely as possible. This causes people to refer my business to others, and that\u2019s how I will keep my company successful.\u201d In the future, he aims to continue growing his clientele base and keeping his current customers happy with his products.\r\n\r\nStarting a business from nothing but a solid foundation of customer service and the promise of customers was not easy, however. Basilio began his business with $3,500 out of his own pocket, which he used to purchase machinery and materials. After he had exhausted his own finances, he turned to Kiva partner Accion Texas-Louisiana for the financial assistance he needed to complete his business\u2019 start-up.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Basilio will purchase the machinery and materials that he needs to complete his upcoming contracts. Without it, he says he would have had to go to commercial banks or exercise other credit options, such as credit cards, to complete these projects. It will allow him to continue to grow his business and reliably fill the plastic needs of his El Paso

In this warm and friendly atmosphere, she lives with her husband and their two children who are 13 and 21 years old. Alicia is dedicated to selling merchandise through specialized product guides, such as cosmetics, clothing and footwear. She began her business in 2010 when she worked as an employee for a transportation company doing night shifts. She realized that she could manage a business simultaneously. For this, she has gradually built her own customer base, which has grown gradually. Her main customers are company employees, independent workers to whom she offers loans in accordance to their possibilities in agreed terms. Her hours are variable but she works approximately six hours a day. Her \"crediKiva\" is the first financing that she has made with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

He takes care of the house rent, food for the family, his mother\u2019s healthcare expenses as well as water and electricity bills. HE has been raising poultry for two years. He started raising broiler chickens with the savings he was able to put together thanks to his work as a cabinet maker, which is his proper trade. He has a workshop in the village. He also raises sheep between two cycles of breeding chickens. Raising poultry and ship bring him necessary additional income to support this family and himself. He has been a member of IMCEC since 2008 and obtained four loans in the past, all fully reimbursed without delays.

She lives with her mother, brother and sisters. She sells food products. In the past, she used to travel to the neighboring countries to stock up on clothing and cosmetics, which she sold on credit to clients who would pay her back within a month. Many unpaid debts have forced her to stop this business. She has opened a small shop in front of her home in order to sell foodstuffs. She has been struggling to provide for the hefty expenses of food, healthcare and clothing for herself and her family. These difficulties have led her to open an account with IMCEC, where she obtained two loans, in the amount of 300,000 francs and 100,000 francs, repaid fully without delays. Now, after having been able to put aside 52,399 francs, she is seeking another loan of 200,000 francs in order to bolster her business. She plans to buy 10 bags of onions, 10 bags of cabbage, five bags of peppers, three cartons of local tomatoes, two bags of soap and two bags of sugar.

When her mother died, Silvia started doing the same kind of work because she liked preparing meals very much.  When she formed her own home, she started working independently preparing lunches, cakes and stews which today delight the taste buds of neighbors and occasional customers that visit the corregimiento (a Colombian territorial division not quite large enough to be a town).\n\nThree years ago she started selling merchandise via specialized product catalogues and this activity has turned out to be very good.  Her profit margin is high and her clientele has increased considerably.\n\nHer husband had to stop working as a cabinet maker due to a serious illness so Silvia had to take over responsibility for the home five years ago.  She now runs both businesses, selling catalogue merchandise and preparing meals, which makes it possible for her to cover her costs and to cover her household\u2019s expenses in their totality.\n\nShe has the necessary equipment to carry out her business.  She manages a good profit margin and good cash flow.  Her sister helps her with all the activities she carries out.  She has the ability to pay and one can see the interest she has in moving her businesses ahead so that her family can advance.\n\nHer Kiva loan is the first loan she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She\u2019ll use it to buy ingredients to prepare meals and assorted merchandise, like cosmetics that are on special sale in her catalogues, that are very good and make her business more profitable.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":248.36,"image":{"id":804777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to prepare meals and assorted merchandise like cosmetics on sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Campeche Corregimiento de Baranoa\/Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-07-07T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57372},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61027},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62197},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":63389},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64604},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":65842},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":67104},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":68390},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69701},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71037},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72399},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76938}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.27,"local_amount":57372,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":57379.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320465,"comment":null},{"amount":109.74,"local_amount":195100,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":195124.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803581,"comment":null},{"amount":79.09,"local_amount":140602,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":140619.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614665,"comment":null},{"amount":26.44,"local_amount":47010,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":47015.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779956,"comment":null},{"amount":0.82,"local_amount":1451,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1451.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324576,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T15:51:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313484,"name":"Luis Manuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luis Manuel is a 41-year old father of three children who has owned and operated a small convenience store for the last 12 years out of her home.

She\u2019s 40 years old and went up to 5th grade.  She has five children: three girls and two boys.  She sells tamales and needs the loan to buy the food she needs to make tamales.  Her customers would like a larger space to sit down to eat with their families because the place where she sells her tamales is very small.  Evodia also wants to enlarge her locale to have more customers so that she won\u2019t have to go out to sell any longer and neglect her locale.  Evodia wants this loan to enlarge her locale and to earn more profits to start another business; she\u2019d like it to be clothes sales.\r\n\r\nGudelia Agustina is another member of the Esquipulas group.  She is 68 years old and has nine children: five girls and four boys, all adults.  She sells fish and needs the loan to buy more fish because she sells both at home and at the market.  Her customers would like her to enlarge the business and hire personnel because of her age; since she\u2019s already older it gets late for her and she\u2019s a person who takes care of them very well, she even gives away a fish.  Gudelia would like to open a grocery store.\r\n\r\nThe other eight members are:\r\n\r\nJorge - to buy fish.\r\n\r\nAdriana - to buy ingredients to make meals.\r\n\r\nEpifania - to buy beauty supplies.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Felipa - to buy ingredients to make fried tortilla chips to sell.\r\n\r\nAurora Luz - to buy materials to make crafts to sell.\r\n\r\nEduviges -  to sell shoes.\r\n\r\nAdriana - to buy beverages, grocery store.\r\n\r\nJosefina - to buy dry seeds to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are very grateful for the loan that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad has granted them and for the things they\u2019ve accomplished with their businesses like: more profits and a better quality of life.  Thank you Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":794942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Ever since she left school she started to work, but since her community is small there are not a lot of job opportunities so she decided to start her own business selling pork meat.  She makes her sales on Wednesdays, but the day before she offers her meat to her friends and neighbors in the community.  The next day, after seasoning the pork, she delivers her orders. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that selling pork is a difficult and arduous business because days before she has to go out to the other towns to buy the pig that she will prepare, and at times it is very difficult to find a pig and she has to go very far from Playa V..  But she is a very tenacious woman, since she has to support her family and also her youngest brother, who has a hurt leg.\r\n\r\nAmada needs this loan to invest in the purchase of pigs, feed and plastic bags to make her sales.

They have also made the most of their customer base in order to sell their customers cell phone minutes too.  This makes them additional income.  They also bought a motorcycle taxi which is a common type of vehicle in this area and is used to transport passengers.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Orlando's first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy four additional washing machines and supplies for making cakes.  His washing machine service has expanded and he often loses customers because he cannot respond in a timely fashion to the great demand that he has.  As a result of this investment, Orlando hopes to improve his profitability and strengthen both his own and his wife's business so that their children can be successful."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":346.29,"image":{"id":804775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery

Her customers are passers-by to whom she sells on a cash basis, although she has some customers to whom she sells on credit.  She attends to this business along with her husband from 9am until 9pm.  This Kiva loan will be the second loan that she has received from the  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with it she will purchase sandals and shoes for women in large quantities on a cash basis.  This will allow her to stock up her business for the high demand that comes in the second half of the year, the season when she generally sees a big increase in her sales.

called \u201cLas Flores de Tlacoachistlahuaca.\u201d  The members decided on this name because that\u2019s the name of the community they live in and because the woman\u2019s house they meet in has a garden with a variety of flowers and that\u2019s why they decided to name their group like this.\n\nThis story is about Antonia since she\u2019s one of the group members.  She\u2019s 36 years old and the single mother of three children: Cesar, Marcela and Juan.  All three are in school.  The oldest is in third year of high school, another is in sixth year of primary school and the youngest is in second year of preschool.  She has had a clothing and costume jewelry store for over seven years.\n\nAntonia decided on this business because she says she wanted to find a way to improve her and her family\u2019s quality of life and also to provide her children with a good education and she could not count on support from any family member.  She used her loan to buy more merchandise like: dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, t-shirts, shirts, underwear and more costume jewelry like earrings, bracelets, rings and necklaces to continue selling her articles.\n\nAntonia\u2019s dream is to expand her home based store a bit more to continue with sales and to have it much better stocked to earn better income and be able to continue supporting her children\u2019s schooling so that they will have very good professional careers.\n\nShe is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and to Kiva for the support from the loan she was granted because, thanks to this, her business will begin to improve a lot and her live and her family\u2019s life will also change.\n\nThe members of the \u201cLas Flores de Tlacoachistlahuaca\u201d group and

The members gave the group this name because there is a small pine tree in the place where they meet.  This story is about Irma who is the group's representative.  She is 40 years old, married, and has four children: Esteban, Mariela, Mariano and Abigail.  Only two of her children are studying.  One is in his first year of a law degree and her youngest is in her second year of high school.  The two eldest children are already married.  Irma has owned a grocery store for 11 years.\r\n\r\nIrma tells us that she decided to start out in this business because she wanted a way to support her children and provide them with a better quality of life.  In addition, this business allows her to attend to her children and not neglect them.  She is also able to support her husband with their household expenses.  Irma used the loan that she requested to invest in buying more sweet treats, soft drinks, water and juice for this hot season which is unbearable.\r\n\r\nIrma's goal is to provide her children with an excellent quality of life.  She would also like to grow her business a lot more.  She is thinking of building premises in order to set up a grocery store so that she can offer her customers a wider range of products in order to improve and increase her profits.\r\n\r\nIrma says that all her fellow group members are responsible people who meet their obligations and really enjoy working in order to improve themselves and get ahead even when faced with difficulties.\r\n\r\nIrma gives thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva on behalf of herself and her family.

She has a total of four children, two girls and two boys.  She sells footwear and needs the loan to buy more footwear to display in the small locale that her husband has just finished building so that when she does not have time to go out to sell she can do it from her locale.  Her customers are recommending that she sell all types of footwear, like tennis shoes and shoes for school, so that they won\u2019t go elsewhere to buy.   One of Zita\u2019s dreams is to set up a shoe store to have something to leave to her children.\n\nThe other group members are:\n\nIsabel - sells fruits and vegetables.\nAntonia - sale of traditional Mexican snacks.\nJuana - sale of traditional Mexican snacks.\nCatalina - to buy ingredients to make bread.\nGloria - to buy ingredients to make bread.\nCecilia - sale of traditional Mexican snacks.\nLuciana - to make tamales.\nClara - sale of traditional Mexican snacks.\nCecilia- sale of traditional Mexican snacks.\n\nThey are very happy with the support that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad has given them to make their dreams a reality.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":804783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy and sell shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"mechoacan,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-07-19T21:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":42000,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":715,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8406.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223479,"comment":null},{"amount":715,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8406.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201757,"comment":null},{"amount":715,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8406.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807347,"comment":null},{"amount":715,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":8406.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618460,"comment":null},{"amount":715,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8406.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572743,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-20T04:04:23Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313514,"name":"Yeral","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yeral was born to be a businessman. \u201cIt\u2019s in my blood,\u201d he says. Growing up in Chimbote, Peru, his interest in business was piqued early by watching his parents. His father worked at a local restaurant while his mother sold vegetables and fruits. Oftentimes, he would join his mother on these pursuits and learned the tricks of the trade from her.\r\n\r\nHis parents\u2019 tremendous influence stayed with him as he moved from Peru to San Francisco in 2004. While working a series of miscellaneous jobs, Yeral\u2019s desire to open up his own business grew. However, as a recent immigrant, he didn\u2019t know how to get things started.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, his drive to become an entrepreneur propelled him to get into business the way he knew best:  Yeral began serving delicious Peruvian treats at food festivals.  In order to secure a spot at a Peruvian Food Festival, he needed a loan to pay the initial fee but when he turned to a major bank, he was refused credit because he did not have tax returns, a business license or a business bank account. \r\n\r\nWithout a set destination, he marched through San Francisco\u2019s Mission district, adamant that somewhere in the sea of pay-day loans and pawn shops, he would find a financial institution that would help him.  At last, he stumbled upon Opportunity Fund, where the staff recognized his potential and his passion.  Yeral got the cash he needed to capitalize his business, as well as a foothold into the mainstream American financial system.\r\n\r\nAt last year\u2019s Peruvian Food Festival, Yeral sold over 400 plates of food and gained recognition for his talent making tasty Peruvian treats.  He wants to return again this year, and this time he expects to sell closer to 800 plates of food, doubling his business over last year. Yeral needs a second loan for $4,000 in order to buy more inventory and secure his spot at this year\u2019s Peruvian Food Festival, which will be held in July.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Yeral devotes 50% of his time to expanding his business and he spends the other 50% working at a bar. He aims to expand his business so that one day he can devote 100% of his energy to serving delicious Peruvian treats.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175.87,"image":{"id":804876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more inventory and secure his spot at this year\u2019s Peruvian Food Festival.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Francisco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-07-05T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yeral","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":378.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":391.41},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":394.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":397.39},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":399.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":402.65},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":404.94},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":407.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":410.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":413.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.23},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":397.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":399.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":402.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":407.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":413.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":378.23,"local_amount":378.23,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":378.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734795,"comment":null},{"amount":391.41,"local_amount":391.41,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":391.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105075,"comment":null},{"amount":394.08,"local_amount":394.08,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":394.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866408,"comment":null},{"amount":397.39,"local_amount":397.39,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":397.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682480,"comment":null},{"amount":399.47,"local_amount":399.47,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":399.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244637967,"comment":null},{"amount":402.65,"local_amount":402.65,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":402.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854386,"comment":null},{"amount":404.94,"local_amount":404.94,"processed_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T09:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":404.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257264162,"comment":null},{"amount":407.7,"local_amount":407.7,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T08:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":407.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263405366,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T17:44:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313515,"name":"Katherin Noemi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katherin is 19 years old and lives near the city of Latacunga in central Ecuador.

Margot has worked in this business since she was very young, always trying to help her parents planting seeds and cultivating the crops. Because of this, she decided to have her own business, which meant having her own fields to farm. Her parents gave her some property so she could farm it. She now cultivates cacao and Noni, since for Margot, these are products which are in great demand on both the national and international levels. For this reason, she gets up very early to work on her parcel of land and give the crops the necessary care. In general, she always has support from farm workers when it is harvest season. She sells her harvest at the wholesale buying centers and at the market in her community, and her profit margin is rising.

They have 2 children; one of them is in school in the second grade and the younger one is barely 2 years old.  C. has had a business selling cellular telephone cards and recharge minutes for 3 years.\r\n\r\nShe says that she chose this activity because she had to look for a way to provide for her children and help her husband with the household expenses.  For this reason she decided to start with this small business, which she says gives her good earnings.  She will use the loan she received to buy more telephone cards and recharge minutes.\r\n\r\nC. tells us that her goal is to continue to invest in her business to make it grow a lot more, since she wants to have a cellular phone store so that she can have more income.

El trabajo de este joven padre de familia se centra en \u201cla agricultura\u201d. Su principal actividad econ\u00f3mica. La siembra de caf\u00e9 en sus 3 hect\u00e1reas de terrenos agr\u00edcolas, es lo que m\u00e1s le gusta; ya que tiene 10 a\u00f1os de experiencia en el cuidado y cultivo de los mismos.

There he started his family together with Natalia, his wife of 9 years.  The couple have two children: Cintia and Angie, who they care for in their own home.  This young father's work is 'farming'.  It is his main business activity.  Growing coffee on his 3 hectares of farmland is what he most enjoys doing because he has 10 years experience in caring for and growing this crop.  He has also seen how, over the last few months, the price per kilo for coffee beans has risen considerably.  This year he will sell his produce to the \u201cCaf\u00e9 Monta\u00f1a\u201d and \u201cBio Azul\u201d cooperative where he hopes to obtain good profits.  However, as he is aware that his coffee harvest only happens once a year, he also works providing a public transport service with a vehicle that he rents.  He covers routes from Pichanaki to Puerto Sotani.  His work is going very well but this year he would like to buy a vehicle of his own which he can also use when transporting his harvest from his farmland to the city. \r\n\r\nJuan belongs to the \"Los Clavelitos de Shakivironi\" community bank and this is his third loan from MFP.  He hopes to receive your cooperation in helping him reach his goals.  For his part, he pledges once more to make his loan repayments on time as he has done with his previous loans.  Juan enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nJuan, with your support, will invest the money he has requested by adding it to a sum of money he already has in order to buy a vehicle called a 'torito' (a type of motorcycle taxi which is used for public transportation)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":804941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy a vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-08T13:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T09:30:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313550,"name":"Yelybeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yelybeth naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Cusco del departamento del Cusco (Per\u00fa) y tiene 25 a\u00f1os de edad.
