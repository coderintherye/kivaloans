In that time, they have learned to be punctual and responsible.  In addition, they have found support and learned to value themselves.\r\n\r\n<P>Maria is forty-four years old and has six children. Maria has owned a small grocery store for the past three years.  Before that, she had a printing shop in the center of town, but the competition was too great and she decided to switch businesses.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Juanita is thirty-eight years old. She lives with her partner and their two children. Juanita has a small store and travels around the region buying and selling different products, depending on the season. She uses loans to smooth out slow spots between seasons.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Rosa is thirty years old. She is married and does not have any children.

The breeding of chickens, pigs and cows is a good business. Some of them breed chickens exclusively, while others combine the breeding of different animals. In actuality, it really depends on the demand in the market.\r\n\r\n<P>The women of De La Buena Esperanza had previously requested a loan from Friendship Bridge. They believe that receiving a loan is a great idea because it helps them greatly in their business being that this loan is one of the few - if not the only - source of credit to which they have had access.\r\n\r\n<P>Some of them believe that a loan is a tool they can use to, one, come out of poverty, and two, gain a certain independence. This is due to the fact that when they invest the loan in their business, and it grows along with its utility, the women will have extra income for them to invest or spend at their disposition. \r\n\r\n<P>However, the battle to escape poverty is long and harsh. For the time being, the women must earn enough to cover their families\u2019 baS. needs. They mentioned that covering their household\u2019s baS. expenses was the most difficult for them.\r\n\r\n<P>Through Kiva, you can help these women fight against poverty. Please support them in their fight! \r\n \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P> \r\n<P>Cada tres semanas los d\u00edas lunes las mujeres De la Buena Esperanza se juntan en la comunidad de Barranche para asistir a las reuniones de repago o de ahorro de Friendship Bridge. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras se dedican mayormente a la crianza de animales. La crianza de pollos, cerdos y toros es un buen negocio. Algunas se\u00f1oras se dedican exclusivamente a la crianza de pollos, mientras que otras combinan la crianza de distintos animales. Realmente, depende de la demanda del mercado. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres De la Buena Esperanza ya hab\u00edan solicitado un cr\u00e9dito anteriormente con Friendship Bridge. Ellas piensan que solicitar un cr\u00e9dito es una gran idea porque las ayuda mucho en su negocio, ya que este cr\u00e9dito es una de las muy pocas, sino lo \u00fanica, fuente de cr\u00e9dito a las cual ellas han tenido acceso. \r\n\r\n<P>Algunas piensan que el cr\u00e9dito es una herramienta que ellas utilizan para, uno salir de la pobreza y dos para ganar cierta independencia.

Fortunately, they were able to pay their past loans easily. One important detail worth mentioning is that previously, in rural communities, those that offered the loans charged up to 10% interest per day. For this reason, institutions like Friendship Bridge are of vital importance to microfinance being that now the women can have dependable access to loans.\r\n\r\n<P>These ladies are currently working in the livestock breeding industry. Many of them are breeding chickens, pigs and bulls. The animals they breed depend on the demand in the market. However, the dream of some of them is to learn to make cakes, finger foods and handicrafts. This is because they want to diversify their businesses so that they do not have to depend on one sole source of income. The dream of some others is to pay off their loan, then take out another one that allows them to purchase more livestock.\r\n\r\n<P>This group of women is very enthusiastic, and for that reason we must give them wings in the form of a loan. They have the disposition to work hard, since they have been doing it their whole lives to survive the harsh conditions of poverty.

En la comunidad de Barranche el negocio es muy rentable, ya que a pesar de que muchas se\u00f1oras trabajan en ganader\u00eda ellas siguen invirtiendo en su mismo negocio debido a la demanda que tienen por sus productos. \r\n\r\n<P>Ellas creen que los pr\u00e9stamos que ellas reciben le son de suma utilidad ya que sin dicha infusi\u00f3n de dinero sus negocios no podr\u00edan prosperar. Por suerte, ellas pudieron pagar las cuotas de sus pr\u00e9stamos pasados con comodidad. Un detalle importante es que en las comunidades rurales anteriormente las personas que daban cr\u00e9ditos cobraban hasta un 10% al d\u00eda. Es por eso que instituciones como Friendship Bridge ayuda mucho al desarrollo de la micro empresa ya que ahora las mujeres pueden tener acceso confiable al cr\u00e9dito. \r\n\r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras por el momento est\u00e1n trabajando en el \u00e1rea de crianza de animales. Muchas de ellas est\u00e1n criando pollos, cerdos y toros. Los animales que cr\u00edan depende de la demanda del mercado. Sin embargo el sue\u00f1o de algunas es de aprender a elaborar pasteles y bocadillos y hacer manualidades. Esto se debe a que ellas quieren diversificar sus negocios para que as\u00ed no tengan que depender de una fuente de ingresos. El sue\u00f1o de otras es de pagar su cr\u00e9dito y poder sacar un pr\u00e9stamo que les ayude a comprar m\u00e1s ganado. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de mujeres es muy entusiasta.

Legend has is that the Mayans would extract gold from this mountain and that around this mountain, the sand was golden in color.\r\n\r\n<P>When one walks through the streets of Cerro de Oro, one can see that they are colored with the beautiful traditional outfits that the indigenous women wear daily. The streets are also adorned with the beautiful sound that the people produce when they speak the Maya-Tzutujil language, a dialect from the region.\r\n\r\n<P>Unfortunately, not everything is rose-colored in Cerro de Oro. Poverty and its consequences, such as malnutrition and illiteracy, are a great obstacle toward the development of the town. For this reason, Friendship Bridge decided to come to aid this town.\r\n\r\n<P>Despite the poverty in this region, the women of Flor de Cerro #1 are decided in working toward achieving a fulfilling life where they can meet the necessities of their families, and Friendship Bridge and Kiva are willing to support them.\r\n\r\n<P>All the women that belong to Flor del Cerro #1 work in the textile sector. Half of them are weavers and utilize their credit to purchase threads and weave the beautiful blouses they call huipiles that can be seen in the photograph. The other half uses their credit for the resale of clothing. They purchase traditional clothing whether it be huipiles, long skirts called cortes, aprons and shawls to later resell in the town, or American clothing, which they buy in the capital city.\r\n\r\n<P>Loans really make an impact in the lives of these women. Many of them have worked as laborers, store employees or housekeepers, earning an income that was barely enough to cover their expenses. However, with the loan, they are now entrepreneurs who own their own business. This is a radical change in their lives.\r\n\r\n<P>If we continue to help them, this change will become a reality. The reality they wish to live, which is to own a successful business with which they do not have to depend on a loan to be prosperous.

Las calles tambi\u00e9n estan ambientadas por el bellos sonido que producen las personas al hablar el idioma Maya-Tzutujil, un dialecto de es \u00e1rea. \r\n\r\n<P>Lastimosamente, en Cerro de Oro no todo es color de rosa, la pobreza y sus consecuencias como problemas de desnutrici\u00f3n y analfabetismo son un gran obst\u00e1culo para el desarrollo del pueblo. Es por eso que Friendship Bridge decidi\u00f3 incursionar en este lugar. \r\n\r\n<P>A pesar de la pobreza en el \u00e1rea las mujeres de Flor de Cerro #1 est\u00e1n decididas a luchar por conseguir una vida plena donde ellas y sus familias puedan satisfacer las necesidades de sus familias y Friendship Bridge y Kiva est\u00e1n dispuestos a apoyarlas. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las clientes que pertenecen a Flor del Cerro #1 trabajan en el sector textil. La metida de ellas son tejedoras y ellas utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para comprar hilo y tejer las bellas blusas llamadas huipiles que est\u00e1n en las fotos. La otra parte utiliza su cr\u00e9dito para la reventa de ropa. Ellas compran ropa tradicional ya sea huipiles, faldas largas llamadas cortes, delantales y perrajes para luego revenderlos en el pueblo o ropa americana que la compran en la capital. \r\n\r\n<P>El cr\u00e9dito realmente causa un impacto en la vida de estas mujeres. Muchas de ellas han trabajando como mano de obra, empleadas de una tienda o dom\u00e9sticas ganando un sueldo que con las justas les alcanzaba para cubrir sus gastos. Sin embargo, ahora con el pr\u00e9stamo ellas ya son empresarias y tienen un negocio propio y esto es un cambio radical en sus vidas. \r\n\r\n<P>Si nosotros las seguimos ayudando este cambio va a poder convertirse en una realidad. La realidad que ellas quieren vivir, tener un negocio propio que sea exitoso y en el cual no tengan que depender de un pr\u00e9stamo para seguir adelante. Con nuestro apoyo este sue\u00f1o se puede volver adelante\u2026"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3075,"image":{"id":157525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Del Cerro 2 Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p> The women of the group called Flor del Cerro 2 are hardworking people.   The reality of their lives makes  any woman who wants to improve the quality of life for her family a real fighter.   This group of women maintains the customs and traditions of Cerro de Oro.   As you see in the photos, all of the women wear a traditional skirt with great pride, and most wear the traditional blouse.   The mother tongue for these women is Maya Tzutujil, but many of them speak Spanish well.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the women work in textiles.  Half of them used their loan to buy thread for making the traditional skirts.  These skirts are the same as you see in the photos.  The other half used the money to buy clothing to resell.  Several of the women earn money buying and selling American style clothing, while others sell the traditional clothing.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the nice characteristics of this group is that the loan obligations are shared.  They are all requesting similar amounts of money, and they are growing their businesses at the same time.   This helps make it a cohesive group, as the women feel they are all more or less at the same level.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women feel that it's important to work with the methodology of the communal banks, because other forms of credit wouldn't be available to them.  The majority of them don't have much to use as collateral, so the loans via communal banks work well for them. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These women share the dream of improving the quality of life for their families.  The situation in which they live is not ideal for the optimal development of their children, as the community lacks good services.    This is why through Kiva, we can help these women realize their dreams and continue to help their families.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/p> Translated by Kiva volunteer Emily Charnes <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Flor del Cerro 2 son unas personas emprendedoras. La realidad en la que viven las mujeres en Cerro de Oro hace a cualquier mujer que quiere salir adelante junto con su familia una verdadera luchadora. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras mantienen las costumbres tradicionales de Cerro de Oro. Como se puede ver en la foto todas las se\u00f1oras lucen su corte, o falda tradicional, con mucho orgullo, y todas excepto una lucen sus m\u00e1gicos huipiles o blusas. La lengua materna de estas mujeres es el Maya Tzutujil, sin embargo algunas tienen la facilidad de desenvolverse bien en el idioma espa\u00f1ol. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las se\u00f1oras trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil. La mitad de ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de hilo para elaborar los huipiles tradicionales de Cerro de Oro. Estos huipiles se asemejan a los que ellas mismas lucen en la foto. La otra mitad de se\u00f1oras invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de ropa para su reventa. Algunas de ellas trabajan comprando y vendiendo ropa americana, mientras que otras revenden ropa tradicional. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Una de las buenas caracter\u00edsticas de este grupo es que en general el rango de pr\u00e9stamos es reducido. Las mujeres est\u00e1n sacando una cantidad de dinero similar. Esto implica que las mujeres se est\u00e1n desarrollando empresarialmente al mismo tiempo. Este rasgo ayuda a la cohesi\u00f3n del grupo, ya que las mujeres sienten que todas est\u00e1n al mismo nivel. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras sienten que es realmente importante trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales porque de otra forma ellas no podr\u00edan acceder a un cr\u00e9dito. La mayor\u00eda de ellas no tienen muchas pertenencias o escrituras que pueden dejar como colateral, es por eso que trabajar bajo esta metodolog\u00eda se les hace muy conveniente. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de estas mujeres es el de sacar a sus familias adelante. La situaci\u00f3n en la que viven estas mujeres no es ideal para el \u00f3ptimo desarrollo de sus hijos e hijas debido a la falta de buenos servicios en la comunidad. Es por eso que nosotros por medio de Kiva, las tenemos que ayudar para que ellas as\u00ed puedan cumplir su sue\u00f1o, sacar a su familia adelante."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":157527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"TO PURCHASE FABRIC AND THREAD FOR THEIR BUSINESSES MAKING TRADITIONAL CLOTHING,  AND ALSO TO INVEST IN MORE AMERICAN STYLE CLOTHING WHICH THEY RESELL.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Cerro de Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-05-10T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brendy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-25T20:04:53Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":1252.5,"processed_date":"2008-06-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":248235,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":1252.5,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":1252.5,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":306297,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":1252.5,"processed_date":"2008-09-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":337314,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":166,"local_amount":1245,"processed_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1246.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371195,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Friendship Bridge -

Thanks to the good relationship they have with the institution, including facilitator Mar\u00eda Quieju, the group has decided to take out another loan. <p>\r\nWithin this communal bank, one can find enterprising women of all types \u2013 some resell American clothes and sell shoes via catalogue, others are weavers and jewelers, while another section embroiders typical regional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d. <p>\r\nThe members are going to invest their portion of the loan in their distinctive areas. For example, the weavers are planning to purchase blue, purple and white threads to make huipiles. The embroiderers are planning to purchase threads of all colors to embroider birds, flowers and Mayan symbols on the blouses. Others will invest in the purchase of jewelry beads to make earrings, necklaces, purses, key chains, belts and bracelets. Meanwhile, another member is going to purchase American clothes in the capital to resell in Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n. <p>\r\nCurrently the women are working with another loan financed through \u201cmicrofinanzas 9\u201d in which they must repay it plus interest in stages every 42 days. <p>\r\nThe group decided to opt for this kind of loan due to the fact that the work they do generates income only after some months have passed. For example, the weavers purchase the thread and then a month later they finish the blouse. The embroiderers can take between one and three months to complete their work. For the women who buy and sell American clothing, although they do that fairly quickly, with their margins it takes time for them to generate sufficient income to pay off their debts. <p>\r\nThis group of women has already been working together and it\u2019s important to keep supporting it. Their respective businesses have been slowly growing and if we support them now it\u2019s possible for their small businesses to start to take off.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<P>El banco comunal Maya Tzutujil 1 ha venido trabajando con Friendship Bridge por m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o.

Las bordadoras est\u00e1n pensando en comprar hilos de todos los colores para bordar aves, flores y s\u00edmbolos mayas. Otras van a invertir en comprar bolitas de mostacilla para elaborar aretes, collares, monederos, llaveros, cinturones y pulseras. Mientras que una clienta va a comprar ropa americana en la capital para luego revenderla en Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n.  \r\n\r\n<P>Actualmente, ellas est\u00e1n trabajando con el producto financiero \u201cmicrofinanzas 9\u201d. En este producto las mujeres tienen que repagar capital m\u00e1s inter\u00e9s en nueve plazos cada cuarenta y dos d\u00edas. \r\n\r\n<P>Ellas decidieron optar por este producto debido a que el trabajo que tienen genera ingresos despu\u00e9s de unos meses. Por ejemplo, las tejedoras compran el hilo y despu\u00e9s de un mes terminan un huipil. Las artesanas que bordan huipiles pueden tomarse de uno a tres meses en bordar un huipil. Las mujeres que venden y compran ropa americana a pesar de comprar y vender de manera r\u00e1pida la utilidad generada por venta es muy poco es por eso que necesitan tiempo para repagar su deuda.\r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de mujeres ya ha venido trabajando juntos y es importante apoyarlas ya que tienen \u201cviada\u201d. Sus respectivos negocios han venido creciendo de a poquitos y si las apoyamos ahora cabe la posibilidad de que sus micro empresas despeguen. \u00a1Denles esa oportunidad!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":157534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase beads for jewelry; purchase thread to make and embroider traditional blouses \/ Comprar mostacilla para elaborar joyas, comprar hilo para elaborar tejidos y bordados tradicionales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-05-08T03:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-25T05:32:45Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":24500,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":2041.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":248236,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2041.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276758,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2041.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":306298,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2041.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":337315,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2041.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371196,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Friendship Bridge -

The beauty of this place is seen in the pretty clothing worn by the women and the men, to a small degree, when they walk down the gray main streets that make up this town with an unmatched history. Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n was one of the pressure points during the region\u2019s civil war to which many people fell victim. Of course, generations have since passed but the memory of the tragedies remains burned in the minds of the community elders. <p>\r\nAs its name suggests, the members of this group belong are of Maya Tzutujil descent and their ancestors have lived for centuries in the extreme west of Lake Atitl\u00e1n. Nowadays the Maya Tzutujil language is mainly spoken in the towns of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, San Pablo la Iaguna, San Juan la Iaguna and San Pedro la Iaguna. <p>\r\nLike many women of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, the members  of this communal bank work in the textile, embroidery and bead-based jewelry trades. <p>\r\nSome of the members work weaving typical blouses of the region, called \u201chuipiles\u201d. These women plan to invest their money in the purchase of white, blue and purples threads \u2014 the typical colors used to make huipiles. Other members weave what are known as \u201cperrajes\u201d, which have a number of uses. Usually it\u2019s used as part of an outfit and is worn as a sash across a women\u2019s shoulder as a sign of respect. Women also wrap perrajes around their heads, as in the past it was worn on this way to be a weight buffer when carrying heavy baskets. Finally, when women go to a place of worship its used to cover their heads as a sign of respect. <p>\r\nOther group members will purchase thread to embroider beautiful birds and flowers on the aforementioned blouses, which can be seen in the photo. This type of embroidery is typical for the town. It is the only town where the women embroider birds in such a majestic way. <p>\r\nFinally, some of the other members will use the loan to purchase jewelry beads to make beautiful necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and key chains, which are made in very innovative shapes and change with the seasons. For example, during Christmas time the women make key chains of Santa Claus, reindeer, Christmas trees and the star of Bethlehem. <p>\r\nOne can say that if he or she supports this group with its businesses he or she is also supporting the history, culture and art of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n thanks to the work of these women who dedicate themselves to express the magic of the town through their craftsmanship.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<P>El banco comunal Maya Tzutujil 2 est\u00e1 conformado por mujeres oriundas de Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n. La belleza de Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n yace en los hermosos trajes que lucen las mujeres y los hombres, a menor escala, cuando caminan por los estrechos caminos gris\u00e1ceos que conforman un pueblo con una historia inigualable. Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n fue uno de los focos de tensi\u00f3n durante la \u00e9poca de la guerra civil en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n. Muchas personas fueron victimas de aquel conflicto. Sin embargo, las generaci\u00f3n pasan y el recuerdo de las tragedias se qued\u00f3 archivado en la mente de los sabios ancianos de la comunidad.   \r\n\r\n<P>Como su nombre lo especifica este grupo de mujeres pertenecen al grupo \u00e9tnico Maya Tzutujil. Se sabe que los Mayas Tzutujiles han vivido por siglos en el extremo sur oeste del lago Atitl\u00e1n. Actualmente los se escucha el idioma Maya Tzutujil mayormente en los pueblos de Santiago de Atitlan, San Pablo la laguna, San Juan la laguna y San Pedro la laguna. \r\n\r\n<P>Como muchas mujeres en Santiago de Atitlan las clientes que participan en este banco comunal trabajan en tejidos, bordados y la elaboraci\u00f3n de joyas hechas en base de mostacilla.\r\n\r\n<P>Un grupo de las clientes trabajan tejiendo huipiles o blusas t\u00edpicas. Ellas van a invertir su dinero en la compra de hilo blanco, celeste, morado y celeste. Estos son los colores t\u00edpicos utilizado a la hora de fabricar el huipil. Otras tejen perrajes. Un perraje es una pieza de tela multiuso. Usualmente es utilizado como parte de la indumentaria y esta sobrepuesta en el hombro de las mujeres para indicar respeto a los dem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n las mujeres envuelven el perraje y se lo ponen entre la cabeza y los pesados canastos que cargan sobre la cabeza para amortiguar el peso. Finalmente, cuando las mujeres van a la iglesia o al templo se cubren la cabeza con el perraje en s\u00edmbolo de respeto. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro grupo de clientas va a comprar hilo para bordar hermosas aves y flores en los huipiles, as\u00ed como se pueden ver en la foto. Este tipo de bordado es t\u00edpico de este pueblo. Es el \u00fanico pueblo en donde las mujeres bordan aves de una manera tan majestuosa. \r\n\r\n<P>Finalmente, otro grupo de clientes utiliza el cr\u00e9dito para comprar bolitas de mostacilla. Con la mostacilla ellas elaboran bellos collares, pulseras, anillos, aretes y llaveros. Los llaveros tienden a ser figuras muy innovadoras y acorde con la fecha del a\u00f1o. Por ejemplo, en la \u00e9poca de navidad las mujeres producen llaveros de Santa Claus, venados, \u00e1rboles de Navidad y estrellas fugaces. \r\n\r\n<P>Uno puede decir que si uno apoya a estas mujeres con sus negocios uno tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 apoyando la historia, la cultura y el arte de Santiago de Atitlan debido a que estas artesanas se dedican a expresar por medio de su arte la magia de este pueblo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":157537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase threads to weave and embroider traditional blouses; purchase beads to make jewelry \/ Compra de hilo para elaborar tejidos y bordados, compra de mostacilla para elaborar joyas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-05-07T19:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-22T20:46:46Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":17500,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":196,"local_amount":1459.57,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1466.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245576,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":196,"local_amount":1459.57,"processed_date":"2008-07-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1466.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274041,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":196,"local_amount":1459.57,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1466.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303538,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":196,"local_amount":1459.57,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1466.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334378,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":196,"local_amount":1459.57,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1466.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368807,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Friendship Bridge -

There is a happy and responsible ambiance in Adela's home, due to the fact that all the members of an accomplished history. <p>\r\nWhat they most like about working under a communal bank system is that, thanks to being a group of women with a good record, they are assured access to loans and avoid any red tape. They also enjoy sharing experiences with each other. With respect to The Friendship Bridge, they group feels its a good institution that is trustworthy, gives out loans quickly and has good customer service. They are also satisfied with the training they receive, among the courses the group highlights as especially helpful are business administration, medicinal plants, women's health and family planning, which is particularly stressed because it can have such an impact on their lives. Keep in mind that in rural areas families can become very large and as a consequence it can result in the families falling further into poverty. <p>\r\nSantiago de Atitlan is a place known for the ability of its artisans. The most beautiful bead-based jewelry in the region comes from there. By luck, this group has two members who work in this trade. They will invest their loans in the purchase of beads to make necklaces, bracelets and earrings. Two of the women work in textiles, weaving tradition blouses called \"huipiles\", while another member embroiders these items with beautiful birds, roses or Mayan symbols. Adela, a woman of strong character and playful at the same time like many women on the Guatemalan coast, sells snacks and American clothing. Finally, Karla R. has a cosmetics business. She buys her items via catalogue and sells them door to door.\r\n\"The Stars of Atitlan\" is a group that empowers all of its members. The members a group that has congealed over time and that works very well together. Due to this, it's imperative that The Friendship Bridge and Kiva members work together to support this group of talented, hard-working women.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las Estrellas de Atitlan han venido trabajando con Friendship Bridge por muchos a\u00f1os. Son uno de los bancos comunales m\u00e1s antiguos y m\u00e1s cumplidos que tiene la instituci\u00f3n y ellas se sienten muy orgullosas de eso. Ellas definitivamente sienten una afiliaci\u00f3n fuerte con la instituci\u00f3n y viceversa. Las Estrellas se juntan cada 42 d\u00edas en la casa de do\u00f1a Adela R. R. para recibir sus capacitaciones y repagar su deuda o depositar su ahorro. En la casa de Adela hay un ambiente de alegr\u00eda y de responsabilidad. Esto se debe a que todas las mujeres tienen una tradici\u00f3n de ser cumplidas. \r\n\r\n<P>Lo que m\u00e1s les gusta de trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales es que debido a que tienen un grupo de mujeres cumplidas ellas se aseguran el acceso a cr\u00e9dito y se evitan el gran problema de la mora. Asimismo, les gusta compartir experiencias de la vida entre ellas. Con respecto a Friendship Bridge, ellas sienten que es una buena instituci\u00f3n debido a que es confiable, entrega el cr\u00e9dito r\u00e1pido y tiene buen servicio al cliente gracias a la labor de la compa\u00f1era Maria Q.. De la misma manera, ellas se sienten contentas porque reciben capacitaciones. Las mujeres contaron que las capacitaciones que m\u00e1s le gustaron fueron las de administraci\u00f3n del negocio, plantas medicinales, salud de la mujer y planificaci\u00f3n familiar. Las clientes hicieron hincapi\u00e9 en la charla de planificaci\u00f3n ya que si les creo un impacto en sus vidas. Vale recordar, que en las \u00e1reas rurales las familias pueden llegar a ser muy extensas y como consecuencia esto puede resultar en que a las familias le cueste salir m\u00e1s de la pobreza. \r\n\r\n<P>Santiago de Atitlan es un lugar reconocido por la capacidad de sus artesanas. En este lugar se produce una de las joyas, en base a mostacilla, m\u00e1s bellas de la regi\u00f3n. Por suerte, en este grupo tenemos dos clientas que trabajan en ese rubro. Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en comprar bolitas de mostacilla para elaborar collares, brazaletes y aretes. Dos se\u00f1oras trabajan con tejidos. Dos trabajan elaborando los huipiles, las blusas tradicionales de Guatemala, mientras que una se\u00f1ora borda los huipiles. Ella borda los huipiles con bellos p\u00e1jaros, rosas o s\u00edmbolos mayas. Do\u00f1a Adela una mujer de car\u00e1cter fuerte y alegre al mismo tiempo, muy t\u00edpico de las mujeres de la costa de Guatemala, vende refacciones y ropa americana. Finalmente, Karla R. trabaja en el negocio de cosm\u00e9ticos. Ella compra cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo y los vende de casa en casa. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Estrellas de Atitl\u00e1n es un grupo que amerita el apoyo de todos. Es un grupo que se ha consolidado a lo largo del tiempo y que han trabajado muy bien. Debido a eso, es importante que Friendship Bridge y ustedes por medio de Kiva apoyen a este grupo de mujeres talentosas, aguerridas y trabajadoras."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":157540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase beads to make jewelry; purchase threads to make and embroider blouses; purchase American clothing and food ingredients; and purchase cosmetics \/ Compra de mostacilla para elaborar joyas, compra de hilos para elaborar tejidos y bordados, compra de ropa americana, ingredientes de comida y cosm\u00e9ticos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-05-07T19:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-22T05:53:29Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":136,"local_amount":1004.31,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245577,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":136,"local_amount":1004.31,"processed_date":"2008-07-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274042,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":136,"local_amount":1004.31,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303539,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":136,"local_amount":1004.31,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334379,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":989.54,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1002.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368808,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Friendship Bridge -

The technique used to make these articles is extremely complex due to the large variety of designs and patterns. <p>\r\nThe women plan to use the loan in the most wise way, investing 100 percent of it in the purchase of fabrics and thread to make their products. They also play to purchase other huipiles to resell in their village or the local market. <p>\r\nThese women are constantly thinking about moving up in life. They would like to see their business be able to grow thanks to the loan and their hard work, since they need a large amount of earnings to able to achieve their dreams. The goal of this group is to see their children be successful by means of a good education. The women hope that their sons and daughters will be able to attend college. They also dream of expanding their business to the point where they can to pay off their debt so their success would not be dependent on outside capital.  <p>\r\nAlong with being a relatively young group, the women think that working as a communal bank is great because they have been able to get to know one another.

Some live in the back of the hospital near the front of their village and others live near a little school. In spite of the fact that they live relatively separated from one another, a sense of unity among the whole is felt during their reunions. \r\n\r\n<P>Unity inside a communal bank is of utmost importance. The functioning of this style of work is based on the idea of social collateral. Every member of the group backs other members among them. Additionally, the good relations between the women create awareness of payment. For example, unity in the group then a woman in the group will think twice before choosing not to pay because she will not want to jeopardize the reputation of the communal bank amidst the institution. If a client does not pay then the whole group is affected and this could create various negative repercussions. This is why solidarity in the group is important so that this system functions in the best manner possible. \r\n\r\n<P>In this group, the women work primarily in the textile area. Three women are weavers. They utilize their credit to buy thread to elaborate typical items that are sold in the market. Two of the women also utilize their credit to buy thread, however they employ it in the art of embroidery. They embroider huipiles and the cuts, which are large traditional skirts. Three clients invest their credit in upbringing animals.  One of the clients invest their credit by reselling clothes and the last client invests her credit by buying vegetables to later resell them in the Solol\u00e1 market.\r\n\r\n<P>The advantage of these women is that they live very close to the Solol\u00e1 market. In this market, there is much commercialization of agricultural products and crafts. During the days of the market, Tuesday and Thursday, the people begin to sell their products at one in the morning and there are people who finish selling at four in the morning. The Solol\u00e1 market is very dynamic\u2014it attracts traders from nearby villages like Panajachel, Concepci\u00f3n, San Jorge, among others. \r\n\r\n<P>The women believe that solicited loans have served them greatly because they have been able to enlarge their business to the point where they can now generate utilities. This is due in major part to the fact that with credit, they can buy inputs necessary so they can be rentable.\r\n\r\n<P>The women comment that the loans have helped them improve themselves because they now have a proper business and with the utilities that they generate they can dress, educate, and nourish their children.\r\n\r\n<P>If this is not a good enough reason to approve these ladies then I cannot think of another! These women work hard for the wellbeing of their children. We must learn to value people like these in the world now that in this world of consumerism we face people who do not help others. Support these women!\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Cerca de la cabecera departamental del departamento de Solol\u00e1 viven las mujeres que conforman el banco comunal Molino Belen. Algunas viven a la espalda del hospital a la entrada del pueblo y otras viven a la par de una escuelita. A pesar de que viven relativamente separadas una vez en las reuniones se siente la unidad del grupo. \r\n\r\n<P>La unidad dentro de un banco comunal es de suma importancia. El funcionamiento de este estilo de trabajo se basa en la idea de colateral social. Todas las integrante del grupo se avalan entre ellas. Adem\u00e1s, la buena relaci\u00f3n entre las mujeres crea conciencia de pago. Por ejemplo, si hay unidad en el grupo entonces una mujer va a pensar dos veces antes de no pagar porque ella no va a querer perjudicar la reputaci\u00f3n del banco comunal ante la instituci\u00f3n. Si una clienta no paga el grupo entero cae en mora y esto puede crear varias repercusiones negativas. Es por eso, que la solidaridad del grupo es realmente importante para que este funcione de la mejor manera. \r\n\r\n<P>En este grupo las mujeres trabajan mayormente en el \u00e1rea textil. Tres se\u00f1oras son tejedoras. Ellas utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para comprar hilos para elaborar piezas t\u00edpicas que son vendidas en el mercado. Dos de ellas, tambi\u00e9n utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para comprar hilo, sin embargo ellas lo emplean en el arte de bordado. Ellas bordan los huipiles y los cortes, faldas largas tradicionales. Tres clientas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la crianza de animales. Una invierte el cr\u00e9dito revendiendo ropa y la \u00faltima comprando verduras para luego venderlas en el mercado de Solol\u00e1. \r\n\r\n<P>La ventaja de estas mujeres es que viven muy cerca del mercado de Solola. En este mercado hay mucha comercializaci\u00f3n de productos agropecuarios y artesanales. Durante los d\u00edas de mercado, martes y viernes, la gente empieza a vender sus productos a la una de la ma\u00f1ana y hay personas que terminan su venta a las cuatro de la ma\u00f1ana. El mercado de Solola es muy din\u00e1mico ya que atrae a los comerciantes de pueblos aleda\u00f1os como Panajachel, Concepci\u00f3n, San Jorge, entre otros. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres creen que los pr\u00e9stamos solicitados les ha servido de mucho debido a que ellas han podido agrandar su negocio a un punto donde ya pueden generar utilidades. Esto se debe mayormente a que con el cr\u00e9dito ellas pueden comprar los insumos necesarios para que sean rentables. \r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras comentan que los pr\u00e9stamos las han ayudado a superarse porque ellas ya tienen un negocio propio y con las utilidades que ellas generan ellas pueden vestir, educar y alimentar a sus hijos. \r\n\r\n<P>\u00a1Si esta no es una raz\u00f3n para apoyar a estas se\u00f1oras entonces no se me ocurre otra! Estas mujeres se dan \u00edntegramente para conseguir el bienestar de sus hijos. Nosotros tenemos que valorar gente as\u00ed en el mundo ya que en este mundo de consumismo cada vez nos topamos con gente que se desvive por el pr\u00f3jimo. \u00a1Ap\u00f3yenlas!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":157550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Compra

Theology.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was born and raised with his mother.  He explains that he never knew his father, and that's why he had to enter an orphanage when he was five years old.  He entered the Father Alves Martins Children's Home orphanage in Infulene in 1962.  He studied, and in his free time he raised livestock, did sports, and finished fourth grade in 1969.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1971 he went to study at Alvor School, in the teachers training school, and finished his studies in 1975.  He had to intern in the liberated zones of Cabo Delgado, and years later in the Salamanga School, from 1976 to 1977.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe recounts how he worked in various schools and in 2000 had the opportunity to attend the Instituto Magisterio Primario of Maputo and in the following year finished without trouble.  Likewise, from 2003 to 2006 he attended the Instituto Superior Mother Africa, where he acquired a degree in theology.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently he works in the primary school Saul Filipe Tembe as a teacher, and lives in his own house.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe has been a client of Hluvuku since 2006, having been disbursed his first credit in the amount of 12000 meticais for the purchase of construction materials, which he repaid without trouble.  With a loan of 20000 meticais, he plans to buy cement, iron bars, stone, and fine and coarse sand.  The space where he will erect his house he acquired through a contract.  He buys the construction materials at a local metalworks, and he has rented trucks for the transport of materials.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe progress on the project is reasonable, and the constraint that he faces is the masons, who don't work on the project every day.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan substantially improved his life.

Coraz\u00f3n De Jes\u00fas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cSagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari project, which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and is a very challenging place in which to live because it is a very mountainous area (altitude ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), it is very cold, it is a difficult place to grow crops, and the area lacks an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems. BCR \u201cSagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\" is located approximately 3,500 meters above sea level in the community of Puca Cruz, the district of Rosario, and the province of Acobamba. \r\n<p>\r\nThe main activities of the people in the region are related to agriculture.  For instance, many people grow potatoes and a variety of cereals, and most people raise small cattle, cows, and bulls. The small town of Puca Cruz, which is on the main road from Huancayo and Paucar\u00e1 to the province\u2019s capital of Acobamba, has some shops but because it is a central location on the main road to Huancayo, it has many major sellers of potatoes and cereals.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 16 female borrowers and a total loan of 8,300 soles (approximately $2,950). The individual loans range from 200, 400, 600, and in one case up to 1,200 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save money except for the initial loan to start their operations, but all of the group members agree to save in the future. The members of the new village bank have various hopes and dreams in connection with the requested loans, ranging from their desire to be trained in marketing (e.g., how to improve their businesses with better marking) and in being responsible from a financial standpoint.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Ideana C. M.. Ideana has the biggest loan with the bank. Because she left another village bank to be in the new one in her own village she does not have to travel anymore to assist fellow borrowers, thereby making it a lot easier to assist such individuals. And, because she is an \u201cancient\u201d client who exhibited her financial responsibility with her excellent credit history during her first loan cycle, she is able to receive a loan of 1,200 soles. Together with her husband she runs a business where they buy and sell cereals; in addition, she and her husband operate a small gas station. Ideana would like to use the requested loan proceeds to buy more gasoline. Although she has already been with FINCA Peru for one cycle, she is still eager to learn more and to continue to save money for the future.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother group member is Bertha P. T., who sells vegetables and fruits in her shop in town. With her 600 soles loan she is hoping to buy more products for her shop.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and is a challenging place in which to live because it is a very mountainous area (the altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), it is very cold, it is a difficult place to grow crops, and the area lacks an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems. BCR \u201cVilla Pachamarca\u201d is located approximately 2,500 meters above sea-level in the community of Pachamarca and the province of Churcampa. The small town of Pachamarca is at the end of a road that winds through the mountains, but the road is not continuous and, as a result, transportation is very limited.\r\n<p>\r\nThe main activities of the people in the region are related to agriculture. The valley of Pachamarca has an excellent climate for agricultural purposes because of the relatively low altituD. and the availability of water throughout the year. In fact, the climate makes it possible to grow a great variety of fruits and vegetables such as corn, beans, tara, avocado, pacay, lucuma, banana, cherries, oranges, cucumber, carrots, and lettuce. In addition to cultivating all of the aforementioned foods, most people dedicate a good portion of their time to raising small animals such as guinea-pigs, chickens, ducks, and rabbits, as well as bigger animals such as cows and bulls. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 5,900 soles (approximately $2,100). The individual loans range from 200, 500, and up to 600 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save money except for the initial loan to start their operations, but all of the group members agree to save in the future. The members of the new village bank have various hopes and dreams by virtue of the requested loans, ranging from their desire to be trained in marketing (e.g., how to improve their business with better marketing) and to receive technical assistance in raising small animals like guinea-pigs, rabbits, and chickens (e.g., how to avoid diseases).\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Marcelina L. P.. Marcelina is seeking a loan of 600 soles and she has been elected the \u201cpresident\u201d of the new village bank. She runs a small restaurant where she also sells clothes and soft drinks. With the proceeds from her loan she will increase her merchandise by purchasing more clothes, soft drinks, and meat. Moreover, she raises guinea-pigs. Marcelina\u00b4s dream for the future is to utilize her farm for raising guinea-pigs and rabbits, to have a bigger (and better) restaurant, and to make improvements to her house. Further, due to her involvement with FINCA Peru, she would like to learn and to continue saving so that she can improve her business.\r\n<p>\r\nBy way of further example, another group member is Paulina S. B., who has her own shop in town; in reality, Paulina's shop is more of a mini-market where she sells almost everything: tools for the kitchen and for cooking, all kinds of groceries, and shoes (her husband has a shoe-repair shop!). With the proceeds from the 600 soles loan she is seeking she would like to buy more goods for her shop. Much like Marcelina, Paulina hopes that her experience with FINCA Peru will teach her to save more money and to be more financially responsible in order to pay back her loan. The loan she is seeking will be used to pay for her children's education because her dream is to see to it that her children become professionals!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":158219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional supplies for the group members' various businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-05-11T17:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damitila Adelayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-26T04:49:06Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5900,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":983.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249216,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277865,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307346,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-08T07:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338410,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371960,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for FINCA Peru - Oct 26, 2008)"},{"amount":350.01,"local_amount":983.35,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":988.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314353,"comment":null},{"amount":-0.01,"local_amount":0,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T03:09:32Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-21T03:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10242616,"comment":"Correction due to overpayment for business 47777"}],"funded_date":"2008-05-12T04:49:06Z","paid_date":"2009-01-21T03:10:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":47778,"name":"Viviana","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Viviana is a very hardworking woman.

Nine of the women are going to purchase thread to make traditional woven items.  Another four women are going to buy thread to make beautiful embroideries.  One is going to invest in a small hair salon.  Another woman is going to invest in cosmetics that are sold through catalogs.  Meanwhile, two others are going to use their money to purchase American clothing to resell.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis group of women believes that their businesses are doing well and it\u2019s for that reason that they want to continue to invest in them.  They are confident that with the money they receive, their businesses will grow and they will have the ability to repay the debt without any problems. <p>\r\n\r\nWithin this group there are three women who are very enterprising because they have two businesses.  Two of them work principally making and selling woven goods and in addition to that have a small store that helps with their families\u2019 income.  Similarly, one of the women has a hair salon.  She currently has a person that helps her with the salon.  The fact that a micro business has an employee is an indication that the business is doing well.<p>\r\n\r\nThe women believe that ever sense they signed up with Friendship Bridge and received their first loan, their family finances have changed.  Now they can help with family expenses because they can buy supplies and school uniforms when their children need them.

Pekerjaannya sehari-hari adalah sebagai penjual es kelapa muda dan soto ayam. Setiap hari dia membeli kelapa muda dari Pasar Badung lalu kemudian dijual lagi dalam kemasan gelas.
