She runs this business to support her primary business of selling fresh fish caught by her husband. To take her business to the next level, Misriah needs 1,000,000 IDR. This fund will be used to buy more small dried fish from other fishermen. After cleaning and drying, the fish can be sold for 10,000 IDR per kilogram.

menekuni usaha bengkel jual beli dan pasang ban untuk mobil dan sepeda motor. Hal ini sesuai dengan pendidikannya yang lulusan Sekolah Tehnik Mesin. Saat ini ia tinggal bersama istri dan anaknya lelaki yang juga membantunya dalam menjalani usaha ini. Usahanya berkembang setelah ia memutuskan untuk menjual tempat tinggalnya yang lama dan berpindah ke lokasi baru yang tempatnya sangat strategis yakni di penggir jalan utama yang menghubungkan Denpasar dan Gilimanuk. Karena merupakan jalan utama, banyak kendaraan yang melintas di tempat usahanya. Seringkali Herman merasa kewalahan karena usahanya masih kecil dan tidak bisa melayani kebutuhan pelanggan dengan baik. Untuk mengatasi hal itu, Herman membutuhkan dana sebesar Rp. 5.000.000.- untuk mengembangkan usahanya. Dana itu akan dipergunakan untuk membeli aneka jenis dan ukuran ban serta sebuah dongkrak untuk mengangkat mobil yang besar. Herman optimis usahanya akan berkembang dengan baik, karena ia percaya dengan layanan yang baik kepada pelanggan, mereka akan puas dan akan datang kembali ke bengkelnya dengan lebih banyak pelanggan baru.\n\n","en":"Herman is in the vehicle service repair business buying, selling and installing tires for cars and motor cycles. This is in line with his education as Engine Technical school graduate. Today he stays with wife and son, who also helps him in running the business. The business grew after he decided to sell his living quarters, and move to a new very strategic location on the side of main road between Denpasar and Gilimanuk. Since it is on the main road, many vehicles pass through his business. Many times Herman felt overloaded, since his business is still small and could not give enough service. To solve it, Herman needs capital for Rp. 5,000,000.- (translator's note: 1US$ fluctuates between Rp 10,000-12,000) to expand his business. That funds would be used to buy several assortments of size and type\/brand of tires, and also equipment to lift large cars. Herman is optismic that his business could expand well, since he is confident about his good service to his clients, and they would be satisfied and would return to his shop with more new clients.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Gwan Ang, Kiva

born in 1971.

Penghasilan suaminya yang tidak menentu mengharuskan Luh Juliasih lebih giat lagi beternak babi sehingga kebutuhan keluarga bisa terpenuhi. Setelah mengikuti sosialisasi dari staf DINARI akhirnya Luh Juliasih memutuskan meminjam ke DINARI untuk meningkatkan modal usaha ternak babinya. Pinjaman pertama ini berjumlah Rp.3.750.000,- dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan dan pembayaran kembali akan dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman setelah babi dipanen. Untuk mengawali, Luh Juliasih berencana membeli 2 ekor bibit babi penggemukan dengan harga Rp.350.000,- per ekornya. Sedangkan sisa pinjaman akan digunakan untuk cadangan biaya pakan selama enam bulan kedepan. Setelah 5 bulan nanti Luh Juliasih berharap mendapatkan keuntungan Rp.500.000,- dari penjualan babinya termasuk babi yang dibelinya dengan modal sendiri. Hasil dari beternak babi ini memang cukup lumayan bisa memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga dan sekolah anak-anaknya.","en":"Raising pigs are side job that is done by the majority of women in Perancak village. Same with Luh Juliasih who is regularly a housewife who also raised pigs around her house since a long time. This certainly helps the family income, besides helping her husband in the field.  Her husband's income is uncertain, and that forced Luh Juliasih to work harder raising pigs, so that family needs could be fulfilled. After attending socialisation from DINARI staff, finally Luh Juliasih decided to borrow from DINARI to increase the capital of her pig farming. First loan was for Rp.3,750,000,- (translator's note: 1US$ fluctuates between Rp 10,000-12,000) for a 6 months period, and payment would be done at period end, after the pigs were sold. To start, Luh Juliasih plans to buy 2  piglets to fatten at Rp.350.000,- per piglet. The rest of the loan would be used as feed expenses for the next six months. After 5 months Luh Juliasih hopes to profit Rp.500,000,- from pig sales, including pigs bought with own funds.

year-old Mrs. Perlinda C. is a resident of GK Village-Bongbong, Ozamiz City.  She is married to Mr. Fedelito C. and is blessed with two children; a girl of 6 years old in kindergarten 2 and a boy of 3 years old in kindergarten 1. \r\n\r\n\tEarly in 1990, she decided to go to Manila to find a job.  In 1994, she decided to resign from her job and started to establish a sari-sari store out of her savings.  She got married in 1997 to Mr. Fedelito C., a construction worker.  Early 2008, the couple decided to go to Ozamiz city due to the economic situation in Manila. Upon her arrival in Ozamiz City, her elder brother gave her a small amount of initial capital for her business to support her family.  The sister of her husband also gave the opportunity to her husband to drive their motor cab to generate income for the household.  She started up a sari-sari store in her residence with the money given to her by her brother.  She buys grocery items and also engages in E-Load business.\r\n\r\n\tWhen she heard that Paglaum MPC was expanding its membership in their barangay, she decided to join in order to have additional capital for her sari-sari store and also to be able to have savings deposit and insurances for her family.  She produced her 1st cycle in Paglaum MPC last July 2008 in the amount of P 7,000.00 as additional capital for her business and also engage in food vending to be sold in her neighbors.  A portion of the proceeds was used in the repacking chlorine and tawas to be delivered to the public market and to different grocery stores in the city.  Unfortunately, an emergency befell her family; that\u2019s why she defaulted in her weekly payment.  However, despite of what happened she will find other sources and able to recover all her losses.  \u201cThat was a lesson to learn, if I have enough savings maybe my capital shall not be diverted to use for emergencies.\u201d she said.  Now she availed her 2nd loan in the amount of P 4,000.00 for additional capital of her existing business. \r\n\r\n\t  She\u2019s hoping that that someday she will able to expand her business, especially for repacking chlorine and tawas for the whole province in Misamis Occidental, but also in the nearby provinces.  She dreams that in time her daughter will become a nurse and her son will become a policeman.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":259818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

A. is 29 years old and is married with two children. Currently, one is schooling and the last born is still breastfeeding. She lives with her family in Kumasi. According to Georgina, she works very hard to support her husband in taking care of the home. She lives in her husband's family's house with the kids. She says the family members of her husband put pressure on her to work as if she is a servant to them. She has thought of renting a house but she is constrained by lack of funds to run her business, never mind talk of money to rent a single room. She is now confused about what to do because everything boils down to funds. <P>\r\n\r\nGeorgina sells household products such as cooking utensils, plastic bowls, buckets and plates. She makes her sales by \u2018hawking\u2019, which is door-to-door sales in the community. Georgina is an achiever and her focus is on saving enough to see her kids through school.

her sacrifices and hard work, Lorence deserves to be called one of the empowered women of her generation.  Lorence G. is 34 years old and separated from her husband, taking sole responsibility for their three children: Angel, 11, Le-ann, 4, and Lugirich, 2. She and her children live together happily in Antagan 2nd of Tumauini, Isabela.  \r\n\r\nAt present, Lorence is striving hard to provide a better life for her children.  She operates a vending business selling homemade native snacks made from glutinous rice and sugar.  She sells her products to her regular customers in the village and earns an average income of PHP 4000 a month.  She has been in this business for three years now and she hopes to maintain it for the future of her family.  In order to do this, she would like to request a loan of PHP 6000 (150 USD) so that she can buy more ingredients for her products and be able to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nLorence dreams of sending all her children to school and finishing their studies. When that time comes, she will be proud that she made it by herself.  She believes that two heads are better than one, but since she is already separated, she promised to herself that she will be both a good mother AND father to her three children. She is willing to sacrifice for their sake and she also knows that her faith in God will guide her.

G. is 51 years old and lives in the village of Antagan 2nd, Tumauini, Isabela.

Three of their children are already married and the youngest is now working. \r\n\r\nMercedes has run a sari-sari store (a community based store) for almost a year now. The income from her store supports the basic needs of their family and serves as a rolling capital for her business. She is applying for a loan of PHP 5000 (125 USD) which will be used to purchase basic in-demand commodities, such as soaps, soft drinks and rice. She hopes that her business will improve because it has also helped them in their farming needs. Her dream of improving her business is her motivation to work hard and live a simple life.

One of Marissa's dreams is to send her children to school and hopefully finish their education, for she believes it is the only treasure that she can give to them.  \r\n\r\nFor two years, Marissa has ventured into the vegetable vending business; she keeps on going to support the needs of her family. In keeping with her dream to see her business grow, she is applying for a loan of PHP 5000 (125 USD) which will enable her to buy more vegetables to sell (in addition to the vegetables she harvests from their backyard).  Aside from vegetables, she also sells snacks, as requested by her customers.  \r\n\r\nShe promises to work hard so that, in her simple ways, she can help her husband in earning a

She is applying for a loan to buy cloth to expand her husband\u2019s business. <P>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader for some more women from her locality.

N. is thirty-six year old trader. She is married with six children who are currently attending school through the help of government free compulsory education. It is her daily dream to provide quality education for her children to give them better future lives. <p>\r\n\r\nAkua is the one you see in the photograph together with her daughter; she is crippled from childhood. You might think that she is squatting but that is the way she is. She finds it difficult to walk. But in spite of her predicament, she is still in business and Akua does things in the normal way. It amazes people when she goes to buy stocks of goods in the big market of Kumasi. Akua started her business with $50 but through determination and hard work, she has managed to expand her business. To me, that is an achievement because looking at her situation, there are few people who would do as well as she does. For this reason, she has been given recognition in the community through her hard work.<p>\r\n\t\r\nShe lives in a community called Apatrapa in Kumasi. Within the community, there are diverse business activities and most of them are petty traders. Akua owns and operates a grocery shop with items like rice, canned foods and drinks, assorted cooking oil, assorted biscuits, candies, evaporated milk, etc.<p>\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy cartons of evaporated milk, bags of rice, canned foods, drinks and cooking oil to increase her stock of goods. With increased stock of different varieties, she hopes to make more income to provide for the educational needs of her children.

Nilda's carenderia started in January of 2006 with a profit of 800.00 pesos. At that time, they could not afford to provide the menu they desired. The family values their carenderia and tries to maintain a quality service. They manage to survive even when there is strong competition. They increased the number of options on the menu to give the customers more choices and as a result, private and public employees, students, and other commuters started dropping in. Paglaum has been a constant financing partner. They applied for an additional loan for her existing carenderia and to venture into a new field: barbecue selling. Their business allows them to purchase more stocks of drinks and meat for her business. She dreamed that someday her business can be seen not only in Ozamiz city, but also in other places in Misamis Occidental.Their greatest desire is for all their children to finishschool and to have a

P. is a single, 61 years old woman.  She has no children, just one nephew in her care that is 17 years old and in his 4th year of secondary school.  Alba doesn't have a partner in life. Her  purpose is to keep her business active so that it continues to earn her income in spite of the increase in the cost of gas, now that she has to go through the streets looking for passengers.  Alba hopes to acquire another vehicle so that her nephew can manage it and get experience in this type of business. That way, he'll have another means of work so he can help himself in the days to come. She hopes that the quality of life in her country will improve, given that the help of other donor countries is so important, since it supports the people that really need it.\r\n\r\nHer main economic activity is providing taxi services, and it is located throughout the city. She has four years of experience at her work. Alba started this business as an alternative way of earning money. She got the taxi service by selling a business selling whole grains that she had in the wholesale market of Bisne in Managua and through other necessary financing arrangements.  Alba didn't have a lot of knowledge about this type of business at first, so the person she hired as the driver turned in very little money and didn't distribute the earnings.  With the help of her family, she managed to find a reliable person for this job. Over time, she has gained experience in the business, but she still needs the requested financing to fund the business so that she can make improvements to her vehicle, including changing the radiator, tires, and other things.  She acknowledges the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and its sister organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":259891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repairs to her vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-22T15:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9900,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399998,"comment":null},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091996,"comment":null},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985379,"comment":null},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445995,"comment":null},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956636,"comment":null},{"amount":286.36,"local_amount":5400,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-18T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5647.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174062,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Garc\u00eda is 50 years old and single. She has no children, just one nephew in her care who is 25 years old and in his 4th year of secondary. Her intent is to increase her inventory so that she has more products to offer her customers. She wants to improve the quality of life for her family since the situation in her country is very difficult. This is how she will show her nephew that you have to work hard to earn a living, which will help him in the future with his own children. Maria dreams that her nephew will be prepared professionally since it's important for his own life and to society, since in the difficult situation the country finds itself in, it's important to achieve a high level of learning and accomplish your own life goals.\r\n\r\nHer main economic activity is running a grocery store where she sells products like cookies, coffee, cigarettes, bread, juice drinks, and more. She runs her business out of her home, and has owned the business for six years. Mar\u00eda began her business out of need to have some economic means of supporting her family. She began with her own money from working abroad. With the money that she could save up, she decided to return to her native country and open a grocery store with a few products such as caramels, soda, eggs, and ham.  This couldn't satisfy the demand of her customers, so she decided to take out a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000, thus opening a new means of support for herself. She currently needs financing to invest in her work by buying sodas, basic cereals, telephone cards, and cleaning products. She will repay Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n and its sister organizations that take interest in helping people who want to work get ahead.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":259895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"capital de trabajo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-02T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399999,"comment":null},{"amount":142.76,"local_amount":2785.59,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2815.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091997,"comment":null},{"amount":267.23,"local_amount":5214.41,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5270.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985380,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445996,"comment":null},{"amount":205.01,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956637,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T00:43:25Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85278,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad Ali is a 38-year-old man who is married and has three children.

Her eldest son is 15 years old and is in his 4th year of secondary school, and her youngest son who is 9 years old is in the 3rd grade in primary school. Her life partner works with his wife, and their purpose is to maintain the business active, as it is the most important source of income for the family, and is the means by which they have been able to provide for their sons. Amongst their wishes is to be able to carry out much needed home improvements so that the family can live better.  Due to the fact that she earns very little, Candida has not been able to realize the changes that she wishes for their home. Her dream is that her sons graduate and become professionals given that Candida has made many sacrifices so that her sons could carry out their studies, have clothing on their back, and a home. She also dreams that all people will learn to recycle so that we can preserve a clean planet. \r\n\r\nCandida\u2019s main economic activity is the collection of junk goods such as: iron, paper, copper, and aluminum. Candida has owned her business for 14 years and it is located in the home in which she lives. When Candida began her business it was with a small amount and with her own capital since she herself found the money to establish her business. It is a very difficult job due to the fact that she has to walk a lot until she has collected a sufficient quantity by pounds, she then takes it to her home, where the heavy collections of junk goods are later moved to recycling companies located in the different countries of Central America. This is a long process, her husband who supported her in this business venture later began working with her, and currently they both generate income for their family. Candida will use this loan as capital for her work since she has to pay for transportation costs, and the purchase of the paper to recycle, iron, and aluminum given that during the collection rounds that she carries out she does acquire a lot of material, and as such it is necessary for her to buy materials from other people who arrive to offer them at Candida\u2019s home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":259900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"Business capital to cover transportation costs and the purchase of materials.

He also desires to give his son all that he will need for the future.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Wilfredo sells merchandise such as: chairs, handbags, shoes and clothing.  He has run his traveling business for 3 years.  He began his business through a friend who acted as the manager.  In the beginning Mr. Wilfredo relied on the little experience he had obtained from his mother to start his business.  He lovingly grew his business little by little and began offering small things such as:  sheets, towels and decorative pictures.  While attempting to sell his products to his customers he was a little timid at first which cost him business and it was not easy to commit to this type of job.  He fought to remain a business owner in order to maintain the livelihood of his family.  Mr. Wilfredo will use the loan to obtain merchandise at a favorable price and sell it to his customers.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Breanne Kochert, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":259907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-22T22:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo Danilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":857.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400001,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091999,"comment":null},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985382,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445998,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956639,"comment":null},{"amount":46.44,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:28Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174064,"comment":null},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":857.16,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":915.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599690,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-22T23:43:24Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85283,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is 20-year-old young man, who lives in Adloun, Southern Lebanon.

They have collaborated with the institution Soro Yiriwaso for one year. This is their second solidarity loan (group loan). The previous loan was fully reimbursed.<p>\r\nThey are planning on using this loan to buy two dozens children outfits, a few pairs of plastic shoes, and twenty cart loads of firewood for heating.<p>\r\nThey stock up either on the spot in Sikasso town (third administrative region of Mali) or in the neighboring villages. The goods are sold retail and most of the time for cash at the markets in the town of Sikasso (such as the market of M\u00e9dine and the large town market), and in the neighborhood. They sell to customers made up of women and men. They hope to each make a profit of 17 000 FCFA per month.

To carry out their work and satisfy their customers, they are collaborating with the micro-finance institution  Soro Yiriwaso,  with which they are on their eighth solidarity loan (group loan).  The preceding loans were settled. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members plan to use this loan to buy five 100-kg sacks of potatoes.

It was founded in 1974. Today, it has a total of 750 pupils with a staff of twenty-three teachers. Since its inception in 1974, the school has produced many of the professionals in town and the country at large.\n\nThis Primary School continues to prove itself in both the academic arena and in sport. Ninety-eight percent of the pupils they sent last academic year for the National Primary School Exams (NPSE) had clear passes. This academic year, they expect to have a 100% passes at the NPSE.\n\nThis is the first loan the school is seeking from SMT.  With this loan, they will be able to invest in some petty-trading in order to supplement their monthly salaries. Some however will use theirs to either buy pieces of furniture or in constructing houses. This loan will definitely improve the economic status of these teachers. \n\nJohn B. C. (left) is the head teacher of this school. Mr. C. was born in Kamalo village, about forty-seven miles from Makeni. He is fifty-five years of age, married with six children between the ages of two and thirty-four. John is currently building a second home for himself.  He will use his loan to buy building materials to continue with the building process. This house will consist of three bedrooms, a parlor, a store and a toilet. Once he is finished building it, it will be an estimated value of Le 10,000,000 \u2013 Le 11,000,000 (approx.

There are eleven in their unit, and they are field workers. NARC was established by the government over twenty years ago. Then, it was called Institute of Agriculture Research. As the name suggests, NARC\u2019s primary job is to carryout research for the improvement of planting materials. They teach farmers (the majority of whom are illiterate) new farming techniques and the use of new technologies and farming systems. They also teach people how to process food crops for consumption. In addition to these, they also plant and provide planting materials to farmers throughout the country. The major challenge they face in their work is the lack of willingness on the part of the farmers to come for training. Some of the farmers prefer doing their work in the old and primitive way.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is the first time NARC (this Unit) is getting a loan from SMT. Others from NARC already got a loan from SMT months ago and successes stories of those loans have inspired this unit to also come for a loan. \r\n\r\nFatmata B. T. (left) is the leader of this group. Fatmata is twenty-eight years of age. She is single with two children. One is in class one and the other is not of school age. She was born in Yoni, Tonkolili district, northern Sierra Leone.

Forzado a tratar de arreglar las m\u00e1quinas, su esposo comenz\u00f3 a ver sus fallas y ahora ya es t\u00e9cnico de fotocopiadoras y experto en realizar las limpiezas de sus computadoras. Desde entonces es el encargado del servicio t\u00e9cnico y a veces tambi\u00e9n, le traen sus vecinos sus computadoras para que les cargue algunos programas, y este servicio les sirve como ingreso adicional.

She has nine children; the three youngest live with her in the home she owns.  Thirty years ago, they went to the rainforest looking for work, never thinking of staying there, much less of buying land where they would make their home and convert the rest of the buildings into an area where trees could be cut and split, to convert them into lumber for woodworking.  She also maD. a zinc fence in order to store the lumber.  Santos and her husband work splitting the wood into 2, 3, and 4-inch width timbers which are 3.40 metres long.  Once they have a good stock of lumber, Santos offers it to carpenters although they usually work to order.  Santos is the bookkeeper for the business and her husband is in charge of bringing the trees and turning them into lumber; they have been doing this work for more than 12 years as it is a profitable business allowing them to support their family.  In addition, Santos prepares between 35 to 40 portions of pork cracklings in the afternoons, which she sells for 1.50 to 2 soles.  She has been doing so for roughly six years; this too is very profitable, as while she is selling the cracklings, she gathers the wood to dry it so that they can ask for a higher price than if the wood were still humid: carpenters always look for dry lumber when they make furniture as it will not warp.  This is Santos' fifth consecutive loan from MFP: she has always maD. her payments without difficulty and is committed to continue working with her community bank as she has done until now.  The loan will be used to buy trees for splitting, so that she will have equity in the lumber and have it ready for sale when her clients need it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":260039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy trees for splitting and resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T02:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.1,"local_amount":126,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":138.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423667,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116936,"comment":null},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011857,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595451,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989697,"comment":null},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":69.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210820,"comment":null},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640434,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T05:24:26Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85317,"name":"Teodora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teodora tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada hace 27 a\u00f1os, y madre de 8 hijos, actualmente vive con 3 de sus hijos menores, y con dos de sus nietas, en su casa propia.

","en":"Carmen is 34 years old.  She has lived with her partner for more than 10 years.  They have 3 children, now they live with only one of them while the other two children study in another city.  For the moment, they live in the house of her mother, they don\u2019t have a house of their own.  For the past 10 years she has worked selling sweets.  All this time this activity has been profitable, and has permitted her to educate her children and cover the expenses of the household.  At this time the business is for her eldest daughter Nayeli.  Her husband works transporting passengers in his motorcar, and it has been two years since Carmen decided to go to the park in the city to sell popsicles and ice-cream.  She sells from 10am until 6 or 7 at night, if it is hot she will remain later, and also offer bags of popcorn.  \r\n\r\nSince she was very young she has worked as a businesswoman.  Her parents sold in an open air market, and since then, for her the work in the streets has been the most gratifying.  The income that she gets, apart from sustaining the household, has paid for the studies of her son in an institution in another city, the housing he rents, and his daily sustenance.  At the moment Carmen is very aggrieved by the illness of her father.  She tries to give him all the medicine he needs so he can recover, and her happiness would be complete.  In the past Circle she was the secretary of her community bank.  This is her second loan with MFP and she continues with the same amount to repay her instalments on fixed dates.  The sum that she is asking for is to buy sweets, 500 soles that she will loan to her husband so he will be able to buy new wheels for his motorcar, and finally with the rest of the money she will buy yogurt to make her popsicles and ice-cream.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":260029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T03:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":450.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423669,"comment":null},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":225.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116938,"comment":null},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":225.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011859,"comment":null},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":225.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595453,"comment":null},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":225.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989699,"comment":null},{"amount":71.91,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":225.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210822,"comment":null},{"amount":71.84,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640436,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T05:53:01Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85319,"name":"Benedicta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Benedicta tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad, ella es madre de 4 hijos, el mayor est\u00e1 en estudios t\u00e9cnicos y los menores est\u00e1n de vacaciones.

She is the mother of 4 children, the eldest is studying in technical school and the youngest are on vacation.  For the past 10 years she has sold chicken soup in the evenings on the corner of a park near her home, a business that she began because she had been in sales and it wasn\u2019t very profitable.  Therefore she felt obligated to change the area of her sales to drinks made from maca and quinoa (grains) and soy, accompanied by bread and cheese, with chicken, with eggs, or with hamburgers, in the park in the city of Santa Ana.  For the moment this business is very profitable, in a day she sells about 50 soles just in the breads, and also she sells various sweets that she makes more income with.  Her husband sells fruit, slices of watermelon at 50 centavos, their only tools of the trade are a tricycle and a cart to peel and cover the fruit.  In the morning hours, Benedicta works frying the eggs, cutting the cheese, parboiling the chicken, etc.  She also prepares the creams to finish the sandwiches, and from 1pm she begins selling until everything is finished.  The hard part is that sometimes she doesn\u2019t sell everything, then the next day she won\u2019t do more preparation, despite this she is happy because she always gets better earnings compared to the soup that she used to sell.  The money that she is asking for is to buy the sweets and the ingredients for her drinks and sandwiches.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":260044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T03:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":254.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423670,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":127.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116939,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":127.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011860,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":127.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595454,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":127.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989700,"comment":null},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":127.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210823,"comment":null},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":127.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640437,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T04:32:48Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85320,"name":"Naciones Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco Comunal \"Naciones Unidas\" esta conformado por 15 socios los mismos que se encuentran en su cuarto ciclo demostrando responsabilidad y cumplimiento en sus pagos, los socios se encuentran representados por la se\u00f1ora Eva.

She thinks of her daughter as her own, even though she is not hers by birth.  Currently Juana lives with her family in her own home in the village near her farm.  She inherited the land from her parents and has spent her life working and cultivating the fields, planting her own crops.  She also rents some of the land out to people, who provide the seeds, fertilizers, and insecticides, while Juana and her children cultivate and tend the crop.  At harvest time they split the yield evenly.  Juana has been working this way for many years.  \r\n\r\nNow that it's wintertime in the Highlands, she will plant primarily peas, for harvest in April.  Proceeds from that will cover school costs for the children.  Later she will plant potatoes.  Potatoes sown in the winter are prone to pests, so she has to buy pesticides to prevent losing the harvest.  If she plants them during April or September, however, she doesn't have to invest in treatments and sprays. \r\n\r\nJuana is a very active member of her village bank.  She is open to any kind of communication or meeting, and she always does everything in her power to make her payments on time.  She will invest her loan in buying pea seeds by the kilo, and the rest in pest treatments and insecticides for fumigation.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":260073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds, fertilizers and insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":417.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989701,"comment":null},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":834.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210824,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T20:52:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85329,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis acaba de cumplir 38 a\u00f1os, viene conviviendo con su pareja cerca de 11 a\u00f1os, justo la edad que ahora tiene su hijo mayor, y hace 5 meses que naci\u00f3 su segundo hijo de nombre Samuel, cuando se unieron viv\u00edan en la casa de su suegra, pero hace como 2 a\u00f1os ya vive en su casa propia.

From a young age, he has dedicated himself to working the land, having inherited a perserverance for this type of work from his parents.  Currently, he plants peas and corn which bring good prices during this season.  Luis sells by the bushel, in other words, sacks weighing more than 60 kilos in which he can fit exactly 200 ears of corn.  Each sack sells for approximately 80.00 Peruvian soles.  Market prices fluctuate, however, which can be difficult.  He has also never ceased planting potatoes and, this season, will be sowing from a seed that develops in only three months.  Unlike other seeds, it is very resistant to the rainy season and to plagues, which is why he doesn\u2019t need to invest much into remedies for these types of problems.  Luis has buyers in the coastal cities, which means his crops have an assured sale.  This is his fourth loan with MFP.

","en":"Margot is about to turn 29.  For the past 10 years she has lived with her partner; together they have 2 school-aged children, and they live happily in their own house.   Since she was single she has applied a variety of techniques to her farming.  As a child she learned how to deal with weather conditions, which she considers important, as this is the determining factor in cultivating crops and a having successful harvest.  \r\n\r\nMargot's day begins at 4:00AM, when she prepares breakfast and, right after that, lunch.  At 7:00AM she goes out to the farm where she spends an hour strolling through the fields, talking with the laborers, who work much better when she is around.  She is about to plant gladioli.  She'll load the seeds up on the burro, while her husband and the laborers plow the rows where the seeds will be scattered.  Margo says that processing flower seeds is a very complicated process.  Once they are harvested they have to be dried.  Then they have to be peeled so the flowers will germinate.  She does this herself because fully-processed seeds are very expensive, and prices vary with the season.  Right now, for example, a sack of seeds costs 150 soles, but could go for more at other times of the year.  She also plants peas, and later she'll plant potatoes.  \r\n\r\nMargot is glad to have MFP, because they give her a place to turn when she needs to invest more in her business.  In the past, she received loans through the internal account of another village bank (Translator's note: members' savings may be channeled to a village bank\u2019s internal account, where they are used to make supplemental loans to village bank members).  She has already received her first loan from MFP, and she will start saving within her own group, where she hopes her work ethic will earn her confidence.  She plans to use this loan to buy fertilizer, which has dropped in price from 215 to 95 soles.  Now she can buy 10 bags of nitrate and potassium to ensure a good flower harvest, which she hopes to sell during the month of May.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":260087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T22:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210828,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T23:20:36Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85333,"name":"Wilfredo Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Wilfredo Antonio O.

Since her pig breeding business is going well, she wants to expand it. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to purchase three more piglets for breeding. She hopes to increase her income and improve her living conditions with this loan. Her husband, Mr. Pheng Srorn, is employed in a government department. Mrs. Vien N. is 59 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is employed in garment factory while another is a motorbike repairer and the other is attending the local school.  \r\n\r\nSeven members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Dilorom\u2019s husband works in Kazakhstan, he sends money to the family every month and tries to visit once every three months in order to see the family and to make a major purchase for the house.  There are no jobs in their village other than shepherding and selling livestock, and of course sales of food and sometimes clothing, however it is cheaper to buy these products in the city.  \r\n\r\nWhile Dilorom\u2019s husband is out of town she basically spends her time sitting at home.  Her father-in-law suggested that she start buying and selling livestock as this business is the main and most profitable business in their village.  Dilorom turned to us for another loan to purchase livestock \u2013 sheep.  She will keep them through March and her father-in-law has promised to help her sell them at the livestock market.

Her life did not turn out well, but she is not the kind who gives up. After the collapse of the USSR, she was left without work as many others, and she got divorced with her husband. In time, she became a student of a friend who taught her to cut hair and when she learned she saved some necessary capital. Her sister gave her money to help Adolat open her own hair salon. It was tough for Adolat and her children without a man in the family, but she remarried and her husband supported her business. To this day she has eighteen years experience in this field, she cuts hair, styles and dyes it, and also rents wedding gowns. Her salon was not in a very good location for her customers. So she has opened a salon in the center of her region, hired three employees and her customers are very happy with Adolat's services. At this time she needs a certain amount of money to cover the cost which went towards ordering wedding gowns from Moscow. The spring is coming soon and so is the wedding season. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":260204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase wedding gowns and expand business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T00:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":277.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427171,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":277.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120678,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":277.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015795,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":277.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599533,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T02:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":277.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993984,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":266.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":277.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-24T03:45:43Z","paid_date":"2009-10-06T11:05:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85373,"name":"Kuldosh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kuldosh is 58 years old but in spite of his years he still works in the fields.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has stayed behind while her husband is away working.  Each month he sends home money.  \r\n\r\nHer friends run a business and advised her to take up raising cattle, so she raises sheep at home.  Her friends supported her business aspirations because they live in circumstances similar to hers, and their brother helps them by taking the livestock to market on Saturdays.  \r\n\r\nZumratoi buys livestock feed on credit.  Her brother-in-law has decided to help out, while she takes care of the day-to-day care of the livestock.  Every three to four months they take the cattle to market and sell them at a profit.

This was why Onakhon decided to start her own business seven years ago selling fabrics used to make her nation's favorite style of dresses. Little by little, she has made her business grow, and because she allows her clients to pay in installments her orders are getting bigger and her business is doing well. However, she would like to continue to improve her life (and grow her business) so that her life will be more stable in the future.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Bahromjon is 42 years old, married and has four children. He makes his living as a market vendor, having sold fruit for the past 20 years. Over this period of time, Bahromjon had acquired the knowledge and skills required to succeed in this business. For instance, he knows how to store fruit so that it remains marketable and does not lose its taste. He sells melons, apples, pears and pomegranates in his town's central market. He is well-known in this market for his attractive prices and friendliness. All of this allows Bahromjon\u2019s business to generate the stable income his family needs. During this time of year, demand for Bahromjon\u2019s products is high. That is why he is planning to buy more fruit to sell. He is requesting a loan that will allow him to do this and expand his business. He promises to repay the loan within 10 months and thanks everyone who chooses to support him. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a solid business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 42 years old and lives with his wife and five children. He is a humble farmer dedicated to growing produce such as potatoes, onions, wheat, corn, and other crops. He is gratified with the harvest of his land and wants to harvest even more. However, he needs to invest money for a larger harvest with better results because vegetables of better quality will increase his income from sales. Norboy also raises livestock. Now he wants to increase his crop production and to purchase more cattle to breed, so he has applied to IMON International for a loan of 3000 Somoni (US $875) for the term of 12 months.  \n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets (including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The first loan, to raise potatoes, was granted in December 2007. The second loan, in the amount of 20,000 lei ($2,000 USD), was granted in February 2008, and was used to raise potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage and melons. The purpose of this loan is to dig a well to have an easy access to water for irrigation.

He is currently in his 4th year of high school.\r\nHer dream is to improve the quality of the clothing she makes. There are many seamstresses who offer services but don't care about making the customer happy. Lucila hopes her child takes over the business and that she gains the necessary knowledge to be able to run the business. She hopes she becomes successful in life and this would be the perfect career that would make her mother proud.  Lucida does clothing repair and sells clothes.  She currently runs her business from her home, located in Rpto San Carlos 2 Calle.\r\nShe's had her business for 6 years. She began this business going because of the economic need she had at the moment. At the time she suggested making the uniforms for her child's school. (La Asuncion), the school loved the idea and gave her the task of creating these.

She runs this business from home, and most of her clients live in her neighborhood. She has previously received three loans from Esperanza; this will be her fourth loan. With these loans she has been able to invest in a freezer and gas cylinder. Today she probably sells twice as much as she did before receiving her first loan in June of 2007. She would like to expand her business even further and hopes that one day she will be able to employ another person to help run the business.

is a member of the \"Luz de Esperanza\" communal bank.\r\n\r\nCarmen is single and the oldest of four siblings. She is 20 years old and studies at the Tourism and Hotel Management university. She started doing catalog sales to help with her school expenses, such as copies, transcribing services, and books, among others. She sells beauty products by catalog. She has been in the university for a year and her customers are her fellow students. Her father is a laborer at the university and the children of workers are given scholarships, which is why she tries hard to get good grades so she can keep her scholarship. Every day before going to school she has to cook for her brothers and sisters because her mother goes to work at the market. She needs a loan for 800 soles so she can have an inventory of products and to cover payments for the sales she makes. She has also had some difficulties at the university due to a change of curriculum which caused her to have to take some new courses and delayed the completion of her studies.\r\n\r\nCarmen\u00b4s

las personas del exterior aprecien su trabajo ya que una parte del procedimiento del bordado es hecho a maquina y la otra es hecho a mano y le gustar\u00eda que sus productos sean exportados al

C. is 60 years old.  She has a 20-year old son who is in school and helps her with her business.  Her goal is to maintain her business so that she can continue providing her family with a source of income.  Like everyone eager to get ahead, she works hard in order to help both herself and her family.  Her greatest hope is that her son will establish his own business so that he can gain experience and confront the problems that he will have to face in business, something that will help him all his life.  Ana's hope for herself is that people outside her country will appreciate her embroidery work, part of which is machine-made and part hand-made.  She would like her products to be exported abroad so that foreigners can appreciate the quality of her work.  She wants them to know that she's succeeded because she's a strong and hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nAna makes a living as a seamstress, making and selling clothes, and as a baker, making and selling baked goods.  She operates the businesses from her house near the San Jose church.  She started in business 30 years ago when she was abandoned by her partner after the birth of her son and faced the everyday challenge of feeding both herself and her baby.  Despite the difficulties, her family took her in and, with their help, she was able to start a business, offering her sewing skills to family and friends.  She also entered into a bakery apprenticeship, work that she turned to in order to supplement her earnings from her sewing business.  She's managed to maintain both businesses, something that was especially hard for her because like most Nicaraguan women she's suffered from breast cancer.  Despite her illness, she had to work because her businesses were her only source of income.  Her faith and her love for her son sustained her while she was ill but the medicine that she had to buy exhausted her capital.  She's applying for a loan to recapitalize her business and buy the basic materials she needs for her sewing and pastry businesses.  She's grateful for the help that she has received from Fundacion Leonn 2000 and other associated organizations.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":260389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T01:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400004,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092002,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985385,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446001,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956642,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T08:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4030.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174067,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

The water is supplied by the National Water and Sewerage Cooperation and she clears her bill every month. She needs her portion of this group loan to buy more matooke for sale.

They average 31 years of age, are married and have at least five children.  They all live in traditional families in the neighbourhood of Heremakono in Kimparana, San Prefecture, in Mali.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase their sales and maximize their profits, these women have decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso.  Their first loan request is for 50,000 FCFA.  This group is just beginning their collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso.  They have two sources of income:  the sale of condiments is their primary activity and catering is their secondary activity.  They get their goods from the main market of Kimparana and Kouroubadougou.  This loan will be used to buy  an assortment of condiments for resale and for their catering business.

Victoria is a 39-year-old married woman with 2 children who are 10 and 15 years old. Both of them study at the Alfonso Ugarte High School.  She is from Ayacucho and came to Lima when she was only 6 years old.  She was only able to attend elementary school before her dad died, and she had to work to support her seven siblings. She was raised in a family where she did the cooking until she got married. She found work in a hairdresser shop. For seven years, she learned to cut and dye hair. Afterwards, she retired and decided to open up a store out of her home called \"Bodega Miriam\". Unfortunately, last Monday she was robbed, and they took all the money in the cash register, but she continues to persevere and is not discouraged.  Since she came to Finca, she has received advice about her business. She has learned about punctuality and how to be supportive of others.  She needs a loan of 1600 soles to buy groceries for her store, like rice, milk, oil, sugar, flour, and beer.  Her dream is to improve her situation, to see her children finish their studies, and to help her mom, who lives in Ayacucho and suffers from rheumatism.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tara Binetti, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":260415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"She needs a loan of 1600 soles to buy groceries for her store, like rice, milk, oil, sugar, flour, and beer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":418.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397266,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":418.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088970,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":418.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982306,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":418.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442855,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T01:38:45Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:49:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85474,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana is the mother of four exciting children.

adobe y piensan en empastar con yeso para que quede mucho mejor. A los 15 a\u00f1os ya era madre de su hija Jenny, desde entonces se levantaba muy temprano, a las 5.00am juntamente con su suegra para ayudarla a preparar el almuerzo para los trabajadores de la chacra, y una vez que fue creciendo su hija mayor, ya iba a apoyar a la chacra. Despu\u00e9s de varios a\u00f1os de trabajar para sus suegros, decidieron cultivar con chacras alquiladas sus propios productos, despu\u00e9s sus suegros les dieron unos terrenos, donde ahora siembran papa y arvejas en grandes cantidades y poco a poco ya est\u00e1n comprando m\u00e1s terrenos de cultivo. La agricultura le es muy rentable y est\u00e1 muy contenta, porque se da tiempo para todo, la dificultad que tienen en estos tiempos es la lluvia, temen que pueda provocar la plaga a las arvejas, en el caso de la papa la lluvia no les deja cosechar, ya que si la guardan h\u00fameda se ir\u00e1 pudriendo. Flor ya viene trabajando por cuarta vez consecutiva un cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y todo este tiempo ha demostrado ser una cliente muy responsable en sus pagos, asimismo asiste a todas las reuniones del banco comunal. El dinero que est\u00e1 solicitando es para la compra de sacos de abono, cada uno cuesta 115 soles, tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1 insecticidas para las arvejas, lo que calcula le costar\u00e1 cerca de 350 soles.","en":"Flor is 34 years old and she's been living with her partner since she was 14. Now she and her husband have four children and they live in the Cumutay villiage. They've built their own adobe house and hope to fill it with plaster so that it is more stable. Flor was a mother at age 15 and since then she's woken up at 5am to help her mother-in-law make lunch for the farm workers. Once her eldest daughter began to grow up, Flor was able to help on the farm. After several years of working for her husband's parents, she began to cultivate her own crops on rented land. Later her husband's parents gave Flor and her husband some land, where they now grow potatoes and peas in large quantities. Little by little they're able to buy more arable land. Farming is profitable and Flor is happy with her work because it gives her time to do everything. The challenge during this time of year is rain, and Flor and her husband fear that it could create a plague for the pea crop. Too much rain ruins the potato harvest, because if the potatoes hold water they'll rot. Flor is in her fourth loan cycle with MFP and she's shown herself to be a responsible client. She makes her payments on time and attends all of the community bank meetings. Flor will use the money to buy sacks of fertilizer, which cost 115 soles each. She'll also buy insecticides for the peas, which she calculates will cost 350 soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":260445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizer and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T18:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.57,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":409.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595457,"comment":null},{"amount":96.43,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":307.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210833,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-25T01:04:06Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85494,"name":"Julia Carlota","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia es social del Bancomunal 24 de 0ctubre\nJulia es casada, tiene 46 a\u00f1os y  tres hijos, los de 22, 21 y 16 a\u00f1os; los mayores est\u00e1n casados y el ultimo  estudia ingles. \n\nElla cuando era joven estudio  para auxiliar de ni\u00f1os, llego a trabajar en un colegio por varios a\u00f1os hasta que se caso, y se dedico a criar a sus hijos, empez\u00f3 a vender ropa en consignaci\u00f3n pero el taller de donde sacaba  la ropa cerro y dejo de vender ropa. \nactualmente Julia  esta sola en Lima por que su esposo se fue a trabaja en el extranjero desde hace 6 meses, animada por una amiga, entra a la venta de productos de belleza por catalogo,\nDesde que comenz\u00f3 en Finca  ha aprendido a como vender su producto y como sacar el capital y no gast\u00e1rselo, y sacar la ganancia, tambi\u00e9n aprende de las experiencias de las  socias  en el Bancomunal \nNecesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 800 soles, para compra productos  de belleza por catalogo en oferta, y poder estoquearse. \nEl sue\u00f1o  de Julia es tener una librer\u00eda bazar.\n","en":"Julia is a member of \"Bancomunal 24th of October\".

She studied business administration but was forced to give it up for lack of funds. The school fees were very high and she was unable to pay them. She found work in the company Proseguros and was there several years. Unfortunately she had to leave her job because her mother suffered a brain hemorrhage and had no one to take care of her. Her father is retired but works in construction. Once her mother's health had improved, Ana began to work again as a secretary, but in time her mother suffered another brain hemorrhage and she was forced to leave her job in order to care for her mother. This time she used her savings to buy a car, which she now rents out. For eight years she has worked selling beauty products and shoes from catalogs. She got married a year ago.\r\n\r\nSince she's begun working with Finca she's grown a lot as a small-business owner. Finca made it possible for her to save up and buy her car, and the advice she's received has been very useful for her.\r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of 1600 soles, which she will use to paint her car and do some needed repairs. Ana's dream is to become pregnant and have a daughter. She is undergoing fertility treatments.

Nimia and her husband are grateful to her father because they have given them some land where they can grow crops and generate their own income, as well as having supporting them in the building of their home with his labor, and in gratitude her husband helps her parents with the farm chores. Now they are going to plant peas, potatoes, and gladiolas, which if planted this month will be harvested in May when the flower prices increase from 30 to 80-90 soles per bundle of 120 pallets.  Nimia is very happy with this work; she and her husband have goals to continue working and growing in order to be able to buy land in the city. Nimia became involved with MFP through her father who belongs to a communal bank, so they have organized another group of which she is secretary, and she promises to efficiently meet and pay her monthly payments. This money will be used to invest in the purchase of sacks of fertilizer and pea seeds. Nimia is very grateful for the opportunity to receive this loan, which will enable her to become self-sufficient and no longer rely on her father, to whom she will always be very thankful.<br

The additional income will allow her to assist with the schooling of her children, expand her business, and to pay her bills early and on time. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":260533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of supplies and basic ingredients, (Flour, lard, salt, yeast, firewood)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chucuito-Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -69.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:50:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20418083,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":517.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111535,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":517.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006722,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T14:47:17Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:20:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85554,"name":"Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Paula pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLas Fronterizas\u201d,  del distrito de Desaguadero, Provincia de Chucuito, Departamento de Puno, de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, con tres hijos, con estudios de secundaria incompleta (tercer grado de secundaria). \nTrabaja con el movimiento Manuela Ramos hace 8 a\u00f1os de los cuales e inicio su negocio de venta de golosinas con 300 soles como capital inicial.\nEn la actualidad su negocio viene superando la demanda proyectada, por ello requiere un capital adicional de 1500 soles para aumentar su mercader\u00eda (golosinas, gaseosas, galletas, enlatados frescos, etc), con la mira de convertirse en distribuidora al por mayor y con ello obtener mejores ingresos para ayudar a su familia, asimismo ella se compromete a pagar puntualmente sus cuotas y esta de acuerdo con los acuerdos tomados por su grupo.\n","en":"Ms. Paula belongs to the community bank \"Las Fronterizas\", from the Desaguadero district.

V. is 67 years old, married, and has 2 children.  Her  20 year old son is in his 5th year of secondary education and her youngest son is 15 years old and is in his 4th year of high school.  Her husband is a security guard.  Candida's goals are to better supply her business since certain changes have occurred over time, for example she now has an industrial kitchen  which contributes to the atmosphere of her business.  Her desires are to have more economic resources to supply the materials needed to maintain this type of business.  She has been doing this work for her entire life and does not want to lose her business.  This way of life provides the necessary income to provide for her and her family.  Her dreams are that her tortillas continue to have the same quality and that she will have a variety of clients, since they are the reason her fame has spread for the excellent quality of her tortillas.\r\n\r\nAmong her dreams she wishes to be able to visit another country, which she only knows from pictures.  Mrs. Candida's economic activity is the production and sale of tortillas.  Her business is located in her home.  She has 40 years experience in her business, which she started on her own.  She decided to establish her own business in her home after her mother taught her the trade in order to satisfy the need of her children.  Candida offers her tortillas to her clients in the most favorable method, and as such has obtained fame with her neighbors and her clients.  In addition to selling tortillas from her home, she decided to offer them on certain streets and improve her income for her and her family, since the price was a little higher.

Her goals are to keep her business active given the actual economic climate, since her country is in a very unstable condition.  Her dreams are to increase her inventory in order to offer a variety of products and satisfy client demand.  She hopes to obtain sufficient income to retire, because she has been working since she was very young to have a provide a better life for herself and her family.

They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees.  They are also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans.  Today, they are requesting a loan of Le 800,000 each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\n\nIsatu (middle) is the leader of the group. She is thirty-seven years of age. She was born in Kambia (155 miles or 249 km from Makeni and 179 miles or 288 km from Magburaka). Marriage brought her to Magburaka. Her husband, who was a businessman, too, had passed away. Isatu has five children, all of whom are going to school. The youngest is six and the oldest is fifteen. She sells pans, bowls, dishes, knifes, cups and spoons. She has been in this business for ten years now. \n\nWith this new loan, Isatu will expand on his business. She reckons buying at least two dozen of bowls and two dozen of dishes. She will also buy additional number of spoons, cups and knifes. In Freetown (390 miles r\/t), where she travels to buy these items, a dozen of bowls cost something between Le 50,000 to Le 70,000. Dishes cost something between Le 50,000 to Le 60,000. The fare to and from Freetown is Le 30,000, luggage inclusive. \n\nSo far, Isatu is facing no noteworthy challenges in her business. She is doing fine in her business and likes doing it very much. With this loan and the income it will generate for her, Isatu will reinvest it into the business and uses the balance of profit in feeding and looking after her children. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":260600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy at least two dozen of bowls and two dozen of dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T22:55:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimany ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2400000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240000},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":103.13,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":307828.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885091,"comment":null},{"amount":61.88,"local_amount":180000,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":184696.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128935,"comment":null},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":246262.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025724,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":492525.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008527,"comment":null},{"amount":82.49,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":246262.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230864,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-22T11:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":492525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102870,"comment":null},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":246262.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019886,"comment":null},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":246262.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864731,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T02:54:24Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:36:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85572,"name":"Olinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nA sus sesenta y un a\u00f1os, Olinda ha trabajado mucho en toda su vida y aun dice que tiene mucho por hacer a pesar de no encontrarse bien f\u00edsicamente.

Her husband works independently as a driver and supports her a lot with her business by driving her from place to place to take her to sell her products.  Isabel gets up very early to prepare all of her merchandise and to take it to different places in her area.  Usually she sells everything she has, and her customers wait for her arrival to buy what they need from her and to place more orders.  This is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

She wants to keep her business going as she needs to continue sending her sons to school so that they can have careers.  She dreams of investing in her inventory so that she can become a major distributor as she would like to have a wide variety of products.  She hopes that God will keep her alive long enough for her to know her grandchildren because now her sons are studying.  She hopes her children will have careers and only after that start their own families, and in this way make decisions about their future.\r\n\r\nShe owns a grocery store, which she runs from her home.  She has had this business for eight years.  Estebana started the business to help pay the household expenses.  She began as a street vendor, offering her products in the streets and sometimes near schools as most of her customers were children.  She had the idea to stabilize her business and that she could locate it in her home.

Sarvaroy has an excellent breed of cow that gives approximately ten liters of milk;  however, in order to increase production volume, as well as profit, she would like a loan to purchase an additional milk cow.
