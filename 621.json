He plans to use the loan amount to buy a new motorbike and he will employ someone to operate it.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Francis hopes to mine stones on a larger scale and sell them in bigger towns, such as Naivasha. He also wants to try his hand at farming as Ndunyu Njeru is very favorable for farming.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":383.33,"image":{"id":799877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy a motorbike to boost his income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndunyu Njeru","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2011-06-28T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.66,"local_amount":3188,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3316.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221995640,"comment":null},{"amount":48.16,"local_amount":4187.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4355.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227077926,"comment":null},{"amount":11.02,"local_amount":957.84,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":996.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232839118,"comment":null},{"amount":73.8,"local_amount":6417.16,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6674.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238837882,"comment":null},{"amount":69.94,"local_amount":6082.85,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6327.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244604819,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4334.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257228350,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8668.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263366600,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T21:46:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":311149,"name":"Ma Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ma Evelyn is 54 years old and married with one child. \r\n\r\nShe is a farmer in the town of Banga, South Cotabato.

Mary is a farmer from Kisii town in western Kenya, where she has been farming for 30 years. She employs 3 farmhands and sells her produce of bananas, vegetables and maize to the local market. She is married with 7 children, two of whom are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan through Juhudi Kilimo of 45,000 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She saved just enough to purchasing sheep. Gradually she broadened the household and her business prospered. The distribution of her milk products additionally brings 3,750 soms monthly. \r\n\r\nJumagul would like to use the loan from Kiva to purchase additional sheep because they have high demand. Jumagul has many plans and wishes for the future including providing an education for her children, finishing the construction of her house and the purchase of an automobile. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The town is a melting pot of people of various occupations such as farmers, cattle breeders, carpenters and ceramic masters. Santalat was born, got married and raised three children in this blessed place. It is a Kyrgyz wedding tradition for gifts to be made to both a bride and a groom. Santalat, according to custom, received a young colt. Over time, by re-selling already grown horses, she was able to generate capital to purchase her very first sheep and a dairy cow. She increased the number of cattle to four sheep and two cows. Every morning Santalat yields several liters of milk, which she uses to make various milk products. Her cattle breeding business was started with initial capital in the amount of 3 000 soms, while a monthly profit is typically 2 500 soms. Meanwhile, her husband\u2019s monthly income from driving a cab is 3 000 soms. Santalat believes that  a constant flow of income into her family's budget will allow her to repay the loan, which she requests so that she can purchase a refrigerator. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

middle son and her daughter-in-law. She is a mother of three sons - her oldest son is married and lives separately, her youngest son lives and studies in Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan).\r\n\r\nSvetlana was born in a large family of a cattleman with five children. She is the youngest daughter. After graduating from school Svetlana enrolled in a technical school in the town of Tokmok in they Chuysk province of the Kyrgyz Republic to become a librarian. After she finished her studies Svetlana came back to her home village and began working in the local library, but because of the financial hardship she also got a job in the local farm as a milkmaid. Her future husband was also working there as a small truck driver. They met in 1983 and had married in the same year and a year later their first son was born. Because Svetalana's husband was youngest son in their family, according to the Kyrgyz tradition he is supposed to stay with his parents.\r\n\r\nIn 1987 and 1989 in the Onobasov family two more boys were born. In the beginning it was very hard for Svetlana and her husband - because of the collapse of the farm she and Siyazbek were left without jobs and decided to start their own business. They used the plot of land which was given to them earlier by the farm to grow cereals and used the profit gained from the sale of the harvest to buy cattle. Right now in Svetlana's household there are three cows, five male and four female calves, and three horses. During the past several years Svetlana had many expenses which had to do with the weddings of her older sons and tuition fees for her youngest son's education in the university, so she has come to ask for a loan in the amount of 40,000 soms (KGS) to buy a milk cow. Svetlana plans to further increase the headcount of the cattle and developing her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Bai-Tushum and Partners:\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and three children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Rustam provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Rustam sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. Currently he wants to purchase more cattle and for this reason he is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of 5000 Somoni. Rustam thanks KIVA for the support that KIVA presents to small entrepreneurs.   \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 23 years old. He is single and supports four people.

is a 30-year-old married man with four children between 3 and 7 years old. Rodger is the breadwinner for his family who lives in a rented house in Hoima, a small town located in western Uganda.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is a group composed of 15 business women. All of them are working to improve their lives and their familys' also. They live in one of the poorest areas around Santo Domingo city, a large community called Los Alcarrizos, which is located at the north of the city.\r\n\r\nGiorgina makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their two children. Giorgina is excited to be seeking her third loan with Esperanza. She successfully paid off her previous loan after using it to make a successful investment in her \"Colmado\" (a small grocery store, located in neighborhoods where people go to buy mostly daily meals).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is working hard to expand by adding new products to his shop, which will increase his family\u2019s income and cover most of their expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":664,"image":{"id":800301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy an engine for the van used for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-07-03T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yassine ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221603666,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226973093,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731207,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534741,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494266,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702366,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299306,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317317,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-29T15:21:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":311366,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia has operated her fruit shop in Njabini town for the last 4 years.

While Nick\u2019s office is in his home, the bikes are built by students at a Detroit high school. The partnering school has a great deal of existing capacity for building, as well as a network for the next generation of cyclists, mechanics, and machinists. Founded in March, this bike project entails designing and manufacturing handmade bicycle trailers. Sales are generated in the neighborhood through open houses, in the city through retail outlets, and nationally through Nick\u2019s website.  In Detroit there is a huge demand for public transportation as it is minimal and unreliable; expanding the capacity of bikes is an opportunity to impact change in the community. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from ACCION USA, Nick will purchase materials for the bikes and advertise the project. Nick hopes to cultivate the positive relationship with the school, allow students to continue working on the project and spread the word about the great need for transportation in Detroit. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information About This Loan \r\n\r\nThis loan has been made as a part of Kiva Detroit and in partnership with Michigan Corps.

She is 28 years old and married to 31 year-old Mauth.  The couple have four children and live in their own home.\r\n\r\nOlimpia works very hard.  She is an optimistic woman who decided to start her own business.  For eight years she has been selling nationally-produced and imported clothes to suit her customers tastes.  She does her work with a lot of energy because she enjoys it.  It is easier for her to have her business near her home because it saves her time so that she can prepare breakfast and lunch for the whole family.  She considers the difficult part of her business to be not having the support she needs from her partner because he is engaged in other work and so she must make her sales independently.\r\n\r\nThe success of Olimpia's business lies in the good service she provides and the variety of merchandise that she offers her customers at reasonable prices.  With the support of this loan, she will travel to the city of Lima to buy a range of clothes wholesale.  Eventually, in order to improve her financial situation, she is planning to open a store in a shopping mall.\r\n\r\nThis will be Olimpia's eighth loan from MFP and she pledges to continue making her repayments on time.  This time she hopes that she will be able to count on your support so that she can continue making progress.

Her goal is to eventually own a sales stall.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are Odilia Mar\u00eda, who has been selling used clothing for 15 years; and Francisca, who is a wholesaler of 'cajeta de leche', 'cajeta de masa', 'cajeta de coco', 'pi\u00f1onate', 'coyolito' etc. (all types of sweet treats).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":800394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy bundles of clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2011-06-27T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Losgia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Odilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25800,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2150},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":184.65,"local_amount":4054.39,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4135.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221597010,"comment":null},{"amount":145.52,"local_amount":3195.28,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T07:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3258.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226966848,"comment":null},{"amount":158.52,"local_amount":3480.69,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3550.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232725633,"comment":null},{"amount":119.22,"local_amount":2617.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T08:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2669.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238754866,"comment":null},{"amount":84.92,"local_amount":1864.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1901.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250697731,"comment":null},{"amount":482.17,"local_amount":10587.26,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10798.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257101996,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-15T02:18:47Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:13:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":311416,"name":"Ad\u00e9gboy\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ad\u00e9gboy\u00e9 est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 33 ans.

Riazan unfortunately, couldn\u2019t give them a proper education due to financial constraints. \r\n\r\nShe is a housewife, staying at home and doing her household responsibilities. She takes care of her children and fulfills their needs. \r\n\r\nHer husband operates a grocery store business. In his store, he sells daily household items such as lentils, spices, rice, etc. to his clients at reasonable rates. His business earns him good income every month which allows him to manage the household expenses. \r\n\r\nRiazan has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the expansion of her husband's business. Being the only breadwinner, his establishment in business is very necessary because the children are growing up now and their needs are also increasing. With the loan, he will buy groceries in bulk quantity to offer more products to his clients and increase his profits. \r\n\r\nShe is very hopeful that the loan will bring positive financial changes and improve the living standard of her family. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Riazan.

From this relationship they have two children with whom they live in their own home, located in the district of Pichari.  For Leonarda, the key to success is responsibility, punctuality and respect for her customers. \r\n\r\nDespite her young age, she decided to start a small shop selling clothing, with the need to cover her family expenses. She knows that this is the first step to achieve many successes during her journey, for she already has a good customer base, and this is because of the good service she offers to her buyers. Generally she works on her own account, and occasionally she receives help from her husband.  Her sales take place in the same location and despite getting good economic returns, she plans in the near future to expand her store, introducing new products to captivate her customers. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP, the obligations of which she agrees to comply with.

She is the owner of a business selling meals and soft drinks.  Her business is located in a space in the living room and terrace area of her home, which is in Montes neighborhood, in the city of Barranquilla.  She lives there together with her husband and two children aged 4 and 11.  She dreams that her children will become successful professionals in the future and this is her biggest motivation.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela started her business more than seven years ago when she decided to support her husband in managing their household.  Since then, through her discipline, she has grown her business and now has regular customers who work in companies near her home.  They are always referring new customers to her.\r\n\r\nIn her business, \u00c1ngela mainly sells lunches and soft drinks.  She would like to grow her business and turn it into a restaurant.  This is why she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy a larger volume of supplies for making the snacks that she would like to add to her product offerings (and she will pay for these supplies in cash).
