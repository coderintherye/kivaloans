As her business expanded, she opened another stall in the Hantalst market and an additional stall in the Narantuul market. These stalls also specialize in various belts. She and her husband were also able to build a new house for themselves with their business profit. Recently, she hired a saleswoman because she needed more time to go to China and import more products for her stalls. She has a keen interest in fashion.

She has a grocery store and Internet cubicles. She works from sunrise, tending to customers who come to her store very early and always receive a smile. At 9 in the morning she opens her other business, Internet cubicles, which is a very lucrative business thank to the high demand there is for Internet service. The most difficult thing is tending to the two businesses at the same time, so her children help her out with the Internet cubicles anytime they can. She has done both activities for five years, and the thing she enjoys the most is talking with her customers and finding out about what's going on in the community.

He has seven years experience in the activity and does it with a lot of pleasure since he knows he will be able to help his parents with expenses. He divides his time between his business and his university studies, which he does not neglect because he wants to be a good professional and not disappoint his parents. What he most enjoys is that with the business his parents don't have to work more than what's necessary and they have more time to themselves. His goal is to grow his business and have a very large store where he can sell her seasonings and condiments. Grinding is the most difficult part of his work because the spices can get into the air and irritate his eyes, but he knows that he has to continue what he has started and wants to work very hard to make headway. This is his second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he was very punctual with his first loan and hopes to be timely with this one as well. He is a very attentive and happy young man at his community bank who enjoys working with the other members. With the money he is requesting he will purchase more herbs and spices, as well as another mill to increase his production.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":296268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase another mill and more spices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-02T04:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miyagi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":285}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.55,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":286.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012352,"comment":null},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":286.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595940,"comment":null},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":286.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990204,"comment":null},{"amount":91.57,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":286.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211329,"comment":null},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":286.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640843,"comment":null},{"amount":92.2,"local_amount":285,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":288.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080312,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T12:04:35Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":98741,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy Q. is 52 years old.

This has not been an easy job, because she has to be very detailed and she sometimes has problems with the sewing machine, which breaks down from time to time. Also, her eyesight is not as good as it was before. Still, Nelly is very hardworking and she hopes to continue working to improve her workshop and increase her income even more. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan from MFP and she promises to be very punctual with her payments.

Pedro has always liked driving, a trade that he learned when he was very young and that gives him a lot of independence because he can choose when he works and when he spends time with his family. In addition it has been very profitable: he has many passengers every day and he uses his own car, so all of the earnings go to him and his family. \r\n<p>\r\nAs experience has shown him, driving a taxi earns good money, and this is how he intends to finance his investment in a three-wheeler van (like a tuk-tuk or auto rickshaw), which will allow him to earn more money and provide employment to another young worker like him.

He very much enjoys working with his communal bank, for which he is the president and and carries out his work with great responsibility.

","en":"Furkat B. was born in 1969, he is married and has three children. He repairs cars and paints them and then puts up for resale. But mostly he just refurbishes and upgrades cars. His body shop is at his house because he think that renting a space is expensive and is not worth this expense. He has remodeled his garage for the shop and practices his craft there.

Her husband is a photographer, and that\u2019s why they decided to open up a photo studio, which is also the family\u2019s primary source of income. Mrs. Buburan works as the cashier at the studio. At first, they started only with one or two film rolls used for taking pictures. Later, they expanded their business and opened a photo shop. Their customers are mostly students, private and public employees and the like. Being a member of Paglaum MPC, financial incapacity has never been a hindrance for the Baburan family. PMPC has helped them through the years. Today, she applies for PHP 14,900 to buy films and additional capital for recopying of photos.

Ergashaev was born in 1960 and has four sons and one daughter. He does not have a higher education, but has a good source of income. He works as a security guard at ATK. He also raises and resells cattle on the market. He rarely buys hay and other fodder because he has a plot of land where he grows oil meal and other fodder for the cattle. At this time he wants to expand the cow house.

As for the manioc, it is sold retail at the San market, from home and door-to-door for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nDuring this loan cycle, each member of the group expects to make an average profit of 65,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan interest, provide for the needs of the extended family and the remainder will be invested in the business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":296632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy smoked fish and manioc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033763,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621135,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020098,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242851,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242852,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678487,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T16:59:25Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":98894,"name":"May's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S., 30, is a leader of a borrowers group consisting of four members.

They know one another through ties of community and kinship (they belong to the same Bobo ethnicity), and they do almost the same work, selling all sorts of spare parts for motorbikes and bicycles.  In addition, these Bobo women sell <i>tchapalo<\/i> (an alcoholic beverage made locally from millet).  The women are in high demand in these businesses of theirs.\r\n<p>\r\nTo satisfy the ever-growing needs of their customers, the group members found that the solution to their problems was joining the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are on their first solidarity loan (group loan).  They intend to use this loan to buy sacks of millet and a sizable quantity of spare parts from wholesalers at the San marketplace.  The spare parts and the <i>tchapalo<\/i> are sold in retail cash transactions at the house in Paridara (where there is no marketplace).  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average profit of 65,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in business.  Their ambition is to diversify their commerce by adding the sale of red wine.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":296644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy spare parts and some millet ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boitoun ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Touhan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foun\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mouw\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Youbasiya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Youbasin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Morow\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":84979.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033766,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84979.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621138,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84979.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020101,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":84979.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242855,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84979.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678497,"comment":null},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84979.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678499,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-08T18:04:29Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":98899,"name":"Marlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Supportive wife best describes Mrs. Marlene T., 55-years old, and married with five children, two of whom are in school.

The members of the group live in large extended traditional families in Soloso, a village in the San Prefecture (S\u00e9gou Region, Republic of Mali). They got acquainted through bonds of neighborhood and kinship. The main business of the group consists in manufacturing and selling various terracotta pots (canaris, jars, thuribles, etc). They learned this business at a young age with their parents. In addition to handicraft, they also sell products such as shea butter. They are very much in demand in this business.\r\n<p>\r\nTo meet the needs of its ever-increasing demand, the Benkadi group decided to join the loan program of Kiva's partner, the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from which it is seeking its third solidarity loan (group loan). All previous loans were repaid without problems.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women intend to use this loan to buy a large quantity of shea butter, and cartloads of firewood (to cook terracotta items). The butter is retailed for cash, at home and at the San market. Handicraft items are sold wholesale and for cash, to the other women in the village, who do not make them.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring this loan cycle, they hope to turn an average profit of XOF 65'000 (ca US$ 130) each, to be used to repay the loan, and to provide for their extended families. The remainder will be invested in their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":296647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy shea butter and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batoma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033767,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621139,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020102,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242856,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678501,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112480,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T00:44:48Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:54:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":98901,"name":"Rosenette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosenette P. lives in a beautiful spot in a rural area within the municipality of Pandan, at the north of Antique Province on the island of Panay.

Her youngest child is in the fifth grade, two others are in college, and one has a university degree in commerce and works in Manila.  Her husband Warlito is a farmer.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Rosenette started a business making and selling bukayo, a sweet treat made from coconut, sugar, water, and vanilla.  Her father taught her how to make it.  The process involves frying up the mixture in a big iron pan over open flame.  Once it's cooked, Rosenette uses bamboo molds to shape it into bite-size pieces, puts five in a package, and seals it up.  In 2008 she was featured on national TV in a show about Pandan, which is becoming more popular as a travel desitnation. After the appearance she says she got many new orders as people text-messaged inquries to her.  Many of her new customers were Filipinos living and working overseas.\r\n\r\nBusiness has been steady since her star turn, and Rosenette hopes to grow her bukayo-making operation.  She is applying for this loan to buy a coconut shredder -- an electric grinder to extract coconut meat from the shell -- and other tools to help boost her production capacity.

The members of the Danaya group live in large extended traditional families in the Soloso village, in the San Prefecture (S\u00e9gou Region, Republic of Mali). They got acquainted through bonds of neighborhood and kinship.\r\n<p>\r\nThey run very similar businesses, consisting in selling soumbala (a condiment made out of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds)  and \"canaris\" (small containers). They are very much in demand in this business. To satisfy the needs of an ever-increasing clientele, the Danaya group found a solution to its problems by joining Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, from which it is seeking its third solidarity loan (group loan). All previous loans were repaid without problems.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women intend to use this loan to buy sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts (to turn into soumbala), and canaris from the blacksmith women in the village.

Lea E. is 47 years old and married. She lives at Paypayan, Oroquieta City. She has 3 children. After she heard news about Paglaum Muti-Purpose Cooperative, she got interested in it; that\u2019s why she joined the co-op in February 2009.

","en":"Rahmonazar is 42 years old, married and has 4 children.  He has a higher education, but he was left without work after the fall of the Soviet Union.  He had to follow his father\u2019s steps and started raising and selling livestock.  He has been in this business over 10 years.  Rahmonazar\u2019s children help with the business when he leaves for work.  He works as a security guard at a train station.  Rahmonazar owns a dairy cow; this is why his wife does not need to buy milk.  He recently sold a young bull in order to purchase a more mature one, which will earn him a good pay.  However, Rahmonazar needed more money for the purchase.  He requested a loan at MicroInvest and is grateful to Kiva for the support.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

She has a \"Sari-Sari\" (variety) store at their residence.

Mrs. O. is an active member of the micro-finance program of Paglaum under PDP-LP. <P>\r\n\r\nOver more than four years of membership, she has accessed 9 loans. Her present loan  amounts to PHP 5,000 to be used to purchase additional inventory. She is also engaged in bread-making as an extension of her business and another income source.<P>\r\n\r\nMrs. O. is very thankful to Paglaum because it helps a lot not only for their living but also for the education of her children.

She found that kind of business was very good because she earned more profit compared to her previous business. <P>\r\n\r\nShe started her business from the capital she borrowed from Paglaum, amounting Php 3,000 as her 1st loan.

This is why many people have decided to become self-employed in order to guarantee income to provide for their families. <p>\r\nCelina F. is this group's coordinator, and she is currently maintaining a very successful clothing sales business. Her sales volume allows her to purchase in bundles, so she has more merchandise to sell for a more extended period of time. With this particular loan, she will buy more women's and children's clothing, which is more in demand. Celina finds \"improving her life condition\", her biggest challenge. She has six children who are all grown up (the youngest is 16 years old).

The name of their Bank is \"Confianza y Desarrollo\" which means, in English, Trust and Development. Definitely one cannot go without the other. The two group coordinators are Hector O. and Jackelin M.. \r\n\r\nHector makes candy. He makes several kinds of staple Dominican sweets, which have milk, coconut, and peanuts usually. They are sweetened with sugar and enhanced with spices like cinnamon and cloves for a more distinctive flavor. Hector's hopes are to make his business into a candy factory where he can hire staff to make the candy and move forward to a more administrative position. He hopes to become a lead candy distributor in the San Pedro province. \r\n\r\nJackelin, on the other hand, has a colmado: a small convenience store where she sells the daily meal items. She will use this loan to buy canned goods like beans and sardines. The Dominican Republic suffers serious power outages and a lot of people do not own a refrigerator, so canned goods are a more convenient option, being less perishable. Her hopes are that the profits of her colmado will allow her one day to build a house with firmer materials.\r\n \r\nThese entrepreneurs have shown outstanding credit behavior and great will to work.

She owns a salon and will buy a hair dryer and more products with her loan.  Her business started up as a bag full of supplies that she used to bring to houses of clients. It has grown into a community salon that has a physical location thanks to her Esperanza loan and good old-fashioned hard work.  She eventually hopes to be able to offer all of the offerings of a spa including massage.\r\n\r\nShe hopes her children can grow up to be professionals and be strong in their Christian faith.  Francelina does not have much free time between her five children and business, but when she does get to relax, she enjoys watching telenovelas (soap operas, which are very popular here in Latin America) on TV.\r\n\r\nBecause of Francelina\u2019s hard work and diligence in repaying her previous two loans, this loan will be for a bigger amount.  She hopes this one will help her business as much as the previous loans have.  \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Esperanza International, thank you for supporting these

They have experienced sustained growth in their businesses, thanks to the capital injection the loans have offered, and to the increased profits their businesses have generated. <P>\r\n\r\nSan Pedro de Macoris is a province specially hard-hit by unemployment and lack of opportunities: the sugar cane industry that was the core of the province has been mostly closed for several years now, and the investments in areas like tourism are not as big as they are in other provinces of the Dominican Republic's southeast. <P>\r\n\r\nSheila P. is this group's coordinator. She is a seamstress and makes clothing (mostly for women). She will use this loan to buy fabric for her activity and to expand to an additional area: she will also buy charcoal to sell. Propane gas is expensive, and a lot of people in rural areas do not own a stove anyway, so they use charcoal for cookiing. Sheila thinks this is something that will help her make more daily money, since the clothing takes longer to make and sell; she has 3 children and wants to ensure her income sources to make sure she will provide properly for them. \r\nThese entrepreneurs have shown great commitment in their repayments and are an example to the rest of their community.

A large number of members in this group are Haitian immigrants looking for better opportunities than the ones available in their home country.  The lack of employment opportunities available in their area have taken them to self-employment, which allows them to guarantee some income for their families, and in many cases, send some relief money to their families back home.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria V. is the representative for this group of five.  She has been appointed by her mates to collect their payments and in general, she watches over the others and knows the general status of everyone's businesses.  This is a position of much respect.  Maria sells shoes and clothing.  Her highest selling items are tennis shoes.   She will use this loan to buy more tennis shoes and some clothing items that sell well, like jeans.

Miguelina and nine of the other women have never received a loan.\r\n<p>\r\nMiguelina used to have a business selling clothes, but decided to go another route because there are a lot of people selling clothes near her.  She wants to start a new business selling shoes for men.  A friend of hers makes shoes and she wants to sell his shoes in her neighborhood, in Puerto Plata.  She also thinks it will be easier to sell shoes to men than clothes to women because men do not take such a long time to make a decision and also pay more (her words).\r\n<p>\r\nMiguelina first heard about Esperanza because some of her family members have already received loans.  Now she hopes it will be possibly for her to receive a loan so she can start her new business.\r\n<p>\r\nMiguelina wants to learn English and hopes that in the future she will be able to study at a school that teaches English.  It is important to her that she will be able to help her children.  She owns a house in the countrysiD., but lives in a rented house in Puerto Plata.
