is married with one teenage son and is the only breadwinner in his family. Several years ago his father became seriously ill. Ivan had to look after him during the day which meant he could only work at night. That is why Ivan decided to become a taxi driver. He has been in business for 10 years now and makes around $30-40 per day. \r\n\r\nIvan is a very determined, hard-worker \u2013 sometimes working 24 hours a day. A year ago he underwent a serious surgery on one of his kidneys. This challenge didn\u2019t affect his business, however. After recovering, Ivan went right back to work and his business continued to be profitable and sustainable. Seventeen loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have also been instrumental in the success of Ivan\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nIvan would like to receive a loan to help purchase a newer vehicle. A comfortable and reliable car will enable him to serve more clients, handle tough competition and expand his business. Profits generated will not only promote continued growth for Ivan\u2019s business but will also provide a good income for his family.   \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d \u2013

is married with two children. Eight years ago she decided to start a business selling construction supplies when a difficult financial situation in the family forced her to look for a stable source of income. Today Olena rents a small store in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk and three vending kiosks in the local market. She currently has about $6,000 in working capital and her monthly net profit amounts to $1,200. She is the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nOlena is a focused hard-worker. Her experience in the construction supply trade and reasonable pricing policy has helped to keep her business stable for many years. Lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have also had a big part in the consistent growth of Olena\u2019s business. She has taken out and repaid a total of 15 loans. Recently, she was able to open three new vending kiosks in the market with financing from a loan. One of Olena\u2019s long term plans is to rent another more spacious vending facility in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk.\r\n\r\nOlena would like to get a loan of $1,200 to purchase 20 fillet sets (200 items each) to sell in her stores. This financial assistance will help Olena increase her sales and grow her business as a result. Not only will it help her get the necessary inventory and attract more customers, but it will help Olena meet the needs of her family and provide a better livelihood for them.

is married with two daughters. When she opened her small vending kiosk she literally started from nothing. Her family was in a very tough financial situation, but Irina decided to take a risk and start a small business selling pet food, treats and accessories in the local market.  Presently, she has about $10,000 in working capital and a monthly net profit of around $1,000. \r\n\r\nIrina has been working with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d since 2001. She has received and promptly repaid each of the 13 loans she has received from the organization. Recently her grandson underwent a serious surgery which required a lot of money from the family. Irina spent most of her time with her grandson while he was in the hospital. However, she managed not only to keep her business open and sustainable but also to increase her sales volume within that period.   \r\n\r\nIrina would like to receive a loan of $1,200 to increase her inventory. She is planning to purchase a variety of pet supplies such as feeders, bowls, mats, collars, leashes, toys, and canned and dry pet food. She believes a good assortment of supplies for dogs, cats, birds, small animals and fish will meet the needs of many more pet owners and help them get the right food or product for their pets. This loan will not only help Irina re-stock her inventory and boost her sales but will also help her earn enough to maintain her family and provide a better livelihood for them.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0406\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0457 \u0454 \u0434\u0432\u0456 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438.

She is married and has two children.   Her parents did not have the financial means to provide for her studies beyond the 6th grade.  In 1986 she took over the family business located in the neighborhood of Xipamanine in Maputo. For family reasons, she had to move to the rural district of Boane where she established a small shop in the local market.  In 2006 friends, neighbors and other store owners introduced her to Hluvuku-Adsema where she got her first loan to grow her business.  The amount was very small but it gave her a chance to learn how to manage credit.  Now her business is going well and provides employment to three workers (two women and a man).  With the profits from her business she has created a Xitique (a local form of savings account). Daily she supports the school fees of three children.  With the loan of 10,000,000MT she intends to increase her stock of products.  Her business has a large impact on the community. In addition to providing a service she also guarantees the employment of three other people, brings products closer to the customer, and provides refreshments to all the merchants and drivers at the market. She hopes to grow her business to best meet the needs of the market and to also increase the size of her home which is no longer big enough for her current circumstances.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Kiva Volunteer Julie Lerch<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nRaquel M. de 48 anos de idade, natural da cidade do Maputo, casada, m\u00e3e de 2 filhos.

Carmona F. is 42 years old and originally from Maputo. She is married, but while growing up she lost her mother when she was just 8 years old.  Her family's financial situation did not allow her to study.  Since 1981 she has been working in her family's business in Boane at a store in the local Boane market.  In 2006 friends and neighbors introduced her to Hluvuku-Adsema. She became a member and obtained a loan to grow her business. Her business grew to a new level and she applied for other loans.  Now her business is doing very well and provides employment to one worker (her son).  The profits from her business have helped her meet her daily needs, cover the school expenses of her two children, and improve the the condition of her home. She plans to use the loan of 13,000,000MT to increase her stock and the variety of products.  Her business has a large impact on the community.

He lives within the Kibera slums with his other two siblings since his parents are now old and reside in the Western Province of Kenya. Nicholas supports his siblings mainly by paying for their school fees. Nicholas has a standard eight education (Primary Level) but is keen to see his siblings get quality education, something he was not able to get because his parents could not afford the school fees.\r\n\r\nThe poor conditions from his home area in Western Province drove Nicholas to come to the city of Nairobi and live with his uncle in Kibera at an early age of 14 years. It was during that period that Nicholas went through vocational training in shoe making at the Makina market within Kibera slums through support from his uncle. His uncle paid $ 65 over a period of eight months where he was attached to a shoemaker and was learning through apprenticeship. He continued to get the shoe making skills for two years (1992 to 1994) without a pay even after the eight months period of learning had elapsed.\r\n\r\nNicholas has now been involved in the business of mending shoes for now 12 years, and he is proud of his work. This is because he is making a difference in someone\u2019s life. Through his business, he has received tenders from the Meridian Hotel, a hotel in Nairobi, to make shoes for their staff. He also gets tenders from sponsored Primary Schools within Kibera.\r\n\r\nGiven the loan of $50, which is repayable over a period of 6 \u2013 12 months, Nicholas plans to purchase a sewing machine through which he can be doing all the stitching individually. Nicholas cuts leather, makes designs, and mends shoes. Since he does not have a sewing machine to do the stitches, he usually takes the shoes he has designed to be stitched to the machine of a friend. This has proved costly since he pays slightly less than a dollar for every pair that needs to be stitched. In a week he is able to make six pairs of shoes, while during peak seasons, he makes 10 pairs. His customers usually have to wait for two to three days for their shoes to be ready. This has contributed to having his customers looking for other places where the services are faster. Nicholas seeks to change this to be able to retain his customers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":18839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a sewing machine for shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-08T19:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-22T18:41:10Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-06-23T09:16:34Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":25550,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":17,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2007-07-23T09:17:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34647,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":17,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2007-08-23T09:17:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45533,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":17,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2007-09-23T09:18:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":57774,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70982,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-08T19:41:10Z","paid_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6217,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angela is 28 years old and married with 1 child.

is married with two sons. She started out as an entrepreneur selling clothing for women in the central city market. However, later she decided to change the type inventory she offered and began to sell knitted wear for men instead. Today, after 10 years, her business is the only source of income for her family and her husband and elder son are actively involved, helping her with sales. Currently, she has about $2,000 of working capital available and her monthly net profit amounts to $900.  \r\n\r\nNataliya is a very focused and balanced business owner. She has received and promptly repaid 18 loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Her hard work together with financial support has promoted the stable growth of her trade.   \r\n\r\nNataliya is requesting a loan of $1,000 to re-stock her inventory. She is planning to purchase 30 smooth men\u2019s sweaters, 40 wool roll-neck pullovers and 50 trendy caps and hats at wholesale prices for further retail sale. A good assortment of inventory at reasonable prices will attract many potential customers to her kiosk, helping her business to grow and expand for the future. Nataliya is also planning to invest part of the generated profits in another small business venture. She would like to expand on a hobby she enjoys and open two small vending kiosks to sell plants, flower seeds and fertilizer during the spring season.

is married with two children. Her small business selling dishware, kitchenware and pottery is the main source of income for her family. Irina received her first loan from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d in June, 2002. Currently, she maintains around $7,000 in working capital and her monthly net profit amounts to $500.    \r\n\r\nIrina has a perfect credit history with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. She has promptly repaid all loans with no delinquencies. Her neat kiosk with a beautiful array of inventory, her customer-friendly service and exceptional prices has ensured the long-term success of Irina\u2019s business.   \r\n\r\nIrina would like to get a loan for $1,000 to re-stock her inventory. She is planning to increase her supplies of ceramic dish ware, porcelain dinner sets, cutlery, coffee mugs and fancy glasses to attract more potential clients to her vending kiosk. Irina believes her efforts and determination in combination with financial support will eventually help her to achieve her full potential, greater income, and success.

After graduating from a college of commerce, she started working as a market vendor. Today she runs her own business selling scarves and swimwear in the central city market. Presently, Tatyana has about $1,000 of working capital. Her monthly profit amounts to $150-200. \r\n\r\nTatyana has been in this trade for five years now. There are very few other businesses selling similar items in the market where Tatyana has her kiosk. Because of this, customer demand continues to grow all the time. Tatyana has established a reputation as an entrepreneur of integrity. She has repaid every loan she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d without any defaults.     \r\n\r\nTatyana is requesting a loan for $800 to re-stock her inventory before the spring\/summer season. She is planning to purchase bright silk, chiffon and satin scarves, soft shawls and one and two piece swimsuits. Compelling prices and a wide range of fashion choices to suit every taste and lifestyle will attract many new clients to Tatyana\u2019s business. An increase in sales will help her generate more profit and pay for her daughter\u2019s college tuition. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0422\u0435\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u2013

is divorced with one child. He is a taxi driver and has been in business for five years. Driving is his only source of income. Sometimes he ends up working 24 hours a day to provide for himself and his family. Presently, he makes around $30-40 per day. \r\n\r\nNikolai is a focused, hard-worker. He started his first business selling groceries in the market. However, after his divorce and changing family situation, Nikolai decided to work in a different business sphere and began driving a taxi. The nine loans that Nikolai has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped him to expand his business. \r\n \r\nNikolai is requesting a loan of $600 to help buy a newer car with improved diesel efficiency that will be both quieter and smoother running. A reliable vehicle operating on bio methane fuel, with eco-friendly fuel consumption, good emissions characteristics and better refinement will not only help Nikolai reduce his overhead costs, but will also lessen the amount of pollution produced and will increase the resource-saving capability of his vehicle. Nikolai is also getting married in May, 2007. He is planning to use income generated by his business to cover some of the expenses of his wedding.   \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u2013

Four children from his brother and five from his sister, who are both victims of the AIDS pandemic.\r\n\r\nJoseph earns his livelihood by operating a salon and barbershop in Raila, a small village within the Kibera slums. It has been in operation for the last 7 years. Joseph received hair dressing skills from his father\u2019s salon and barbershop in Ahero, in the Western part of Kenya, where he worked for 2 years. He would blow dry (straightening) and perm (chemical application for straightening) ladies\u2019 hair and give haircuts to men. Joseph pooled his savings of Ksh 2,000.00 ($29) with his father\u2019s kind donation of 3,000.00 ($43) to rent a room, buy a blowdryer and a shaving machine. He says he is happy seeing his clients beam with joy after doing their hair.\r\n\r\nJoseph\u2019s fame in Kibera is known and right now he is turning away a good number of his clients because the hairdryer and blowdryer he has cannot meet the growing demand of his many customers.

He doesn\u2019t have a store but supplies the local Market directly from his home.  He learned about Hluvuku at the end of 2006 through some neighbors who are small business owners and he became interested in getting a loan for himself.  Currently his business of raising chickens is going well, but the number of chicks produced is very small given his financial limitations.  He employs one sales person and also counts on support from his wife.  The business of selling chickens is the primary source of income for the family\u2019s survival.  With a loan of 25,000MT he plans to increase the volume of the business by increasing the number of chicks produced which will increase his income capacity.  His business has a large impact on his community.  Besides providing employment, the community benefits from the animal protein sold at affordable prices.

She always wanted to be an entrepreneur and saw many opportunities everywhere she looked. Irina decided on a small business selling clothing and footwear for women and today she runs a vending kiosk in one of the local markets. Currently, Irina has about $4,000 of working capital in her business and she makes about $600 a month in net profit.  \r\n\r\nIrina is very cheery and optimistic. Her radiant smile and ability to make her clients feel welcome at her kiosk attracts many potential customers and helps her business grow. Irina has been a client with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d since 2002.  \r\n\r\nIrina is requesting a loan for $1,000 to open a new vending facility where she would like to begin selling shoes. She is planning to rent a facility, do all the necessary remodeling and purchase a variety of shoes, sneakers and sandals in preparation for the spring season. Irina\u2019s business and marketing abilities in combination with financial assistance will help her to get this new venture off the ground and further increase her success and income.

The turnover of her trade is very fast and she feels very lucky.  Now she doesn\u2019t have to work under rain, snow and during very hot summers.

The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Cultivate Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T01:06:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T23:35:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:43:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15389,"comment":"Banca comunal asoc 1ero de agosto sta luc\u00eda 1era cuota\r\n"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:22:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21960,"comment":"2do pago asociacion 1 de agosto de sta lucia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:26:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29294,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto "},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:09:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40394,"comment":"4to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:18:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65656,"comment":"5to pago 1er de agosto"},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66072,"comment":"6to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T23:35:22Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6418,"name":"Oswaldo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Oswaldo has been farming for 25 years and raising cattle for 30.

<p>Barbarito B. is a farmer in the Santa Lucia County area. He owns a small plot of land where he lives with his wife, Maria, and their three children. Because he is from Santa Lucia, an area known for its rice cultivation, he has been growing rice his whole life. He also has experience with raising cows, which he owns a couple of. He hopes the loan he receives will help him in making his rice farming more efficient.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbarito is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farm rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T01:06:52Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barbarito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-29T23:42:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:44:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15390,"comment":"Banca Comunal asoc 1ero de agosto sta luc\u00eda 1era cuota"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:23:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21961,"comment":"2do pago asociacion 1 de agosto sta lucia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:23:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29289,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:09:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40395,"comment":"4to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:19:32Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65657,"comment":"5to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66073,"comment":"6to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-15T23:42:47Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6432,"name":"Musuai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cFlower means happy,\u201d that\u2019s why a mother from Letogo named Musuai decided to have a Flowering Garden business.

The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invest in rice seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T01:07:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-30T06:32:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:47:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15391,"comment":"Banca comunal asoc 1ero de agosto sta luc\u00eda 1er pago"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:23:56Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21962,"comment":"2do pago asociacion 1 de agosto sta lucia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:24:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29290,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:10:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40396,"comment":"4to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:20:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65658,"comment":"5to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66074,"comment":"6to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-16T06:32:23Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:48:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6434,"name":"Walter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Despite only having an elementary education, Walter A. has a successful farm.

The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Plant and cultivate rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-30T10:54:14Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21381,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-76,"local_amount":-76,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T07:36:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":-76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27103,"comment":"This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted."},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:21:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40787,"comment":"2DO PAGO STA LUCIA"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:17:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45306,"comment":"3er pago centro agr\u00edcola sta lucia"},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:15:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99060,"comment":"6to pago sta lucia"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106820,"comment":"6to pago sta lucia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-16T10:54:14Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6437,"name":"Salu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salu was born 17th June 1975.

He has a very small farm, but it suffices to cover the expenses of his family. He is hoping that with this loan he will be able to maximize the production of his fields. He has about 25 years of experience in rice farming. He has three children ages 16, 12 and 5 who are all in school.

All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":19390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Plant Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-27T19:51:15Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:48:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15392,"comment":"Banca comunal  asoc 1ero de agosto sta lucia 1er pago"},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:24:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21963,"comment":"2do pago asociacion 1 de agosto de sta lucia"},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T21:33:32Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29298,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:10:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40397,"comment":"4to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:20:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65659,"comment":"5to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":405,"local_amount":405,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":405,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66075,"comment":"6to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-13T19:51:15Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6442,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" <p>Francisco has been a rice farmer his entire life.

He has been on this particular plot of land for the last 16 years. He has had 6 children, two of whom are still in school and live with him and his wife Vilma. On his farm, he also raises pigs and horses as additional sources of income. He plans to invest all of the loan money in his area of expertise, which is rice farming. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Enrique is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Grow rice on his lands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T22:26:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:38:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16570,"comment":"pago de 1era cuota asoc Dios con nosotros Sta Luc\u00eda"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:36:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21974,"comment":"2do pago asociacion dios con nosotros"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:19:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29287,"comment":"3er pago asociacion dios con nosotros"},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39058,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:48:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39730,"comment":"4to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:07:32Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53279,"comment":"5to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":320,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65650,"comment":"6to pago dios con nosotros"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T22:26:39Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6445,"name":"Do","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Do lives with her niece and nephew, who have one son who is 11 years old.

All of the members of the Paypayales Communal Bank are part of a rice farmers cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us).

This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":19424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-12T17:43:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-26T23:13:02Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":325,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:34:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16564,"comment":"pago de 1era cuota asoc Dios con nosotros Sta Luc\u00eda"},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:32:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21968,"comment":"2do pago asociacion dios con nosotros"},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:15:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29281,"comment":"3er pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:44:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39724,"comment":"4to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:03:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53273,"comment":"5to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":195,"local_amount":195,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65644,"comment":"pago de 6ta cuota dios con nosotros"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-12T23:13:02Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6462,"name":"Holger","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Holger is a young farmer who still works the lands with his parents.

He has been a rice farmer as far back as he can remember, as his parents had him contributing on the farm as soon as he was old enough to work. He and his wife Eufemia have 5 children, two of whom (ages 17 and 6) still live with them. On his farm, Ucepio farms mainly rice, although there are some plantain trees and there is also livestock.

All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us).

Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":19428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy pesticides, fertilizer and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ucepio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T22:49:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:38:07Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16569,"comment":"Pago de 1era cuota asoc Dios con nosotros Sta Luc\u00eda"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:35:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21973,"comment":"2do pago asociacion dios con nosotros"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:18:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29286,"comment":"3er pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:47:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39729,"comment":"4to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:06:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53278,"comment":"5to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":555,"local_amount":555,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":555,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65649,"comment":"6to pago dios con nosotros"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T22:49:06Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6465,"name":"Simon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Despite his old age, Simon is still a hardworking rice farmer.

A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":19431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:29:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-29T14:20:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:35:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16566,"comment":"pago de 1era cuota asociaci\u00f3n Dios con nosotros Sta Lucia"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:33:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21970,"comment":"2do pago asociacion dios con nosotros"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:17:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29283,"comment":"3er pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:45:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39726,"comment":"4to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:04:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53275,"comment":"5to pago dios con nosotros"},{"amount":555,"local_amount":555,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":555,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65646,"comment":"6to pago dios con nosotros"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-15T14:20:04Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6467,"name":"Roberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Roberto R. is a hardworking rice farmer. He has owned his lands for about 4 years, deciding to move away from his family's plot shortly after having his first child. Although his farm is small, it provides enough rice to support the household. He learned rice farming from his father, who has been farming for his entire life as well. He and his wife Andrea have two children, one who is 5 and the other who is 2. They are optimistic about the loan and are hoping their lands continue to be productive.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberto is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit.

They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt.

That is how she came to start her own small business. Svitlana realized that it would require stamina and flexibility, but she decided to take a risk and try it out, strongly believing that she would succeed. Today Svitlana runs a successful small business selling plastic dishware and quality plastic bags. \r\n\r\nSvitlana is very serious and determined. Her great entrepreneurial skills and commitment to her business have helped her keep her sales high and costs low. The ability to give her customers what they want plus a little more, such as a smile or a word of encouragement, has helped Svitlana keep loyal customers who come back over and over again. She has been in this business now for twelve years and currently has about $2,000 in working capital with a monthly profit of around $340. \r\n  \r\nSvitlana is requesting a loan for $1,200 to open a new vending facility in a little town on the Sea of Azov called Kirilovka.

is widowed and takes care of her two daughter ages 17 and 18 and a son who is 15. She was born and raised in Western Ukraine and came to appreciate traditional Ukrainian embroidering early in life. For nearly 14 years, she has successfully operated a business selling bright, colorful embroidered products and the tools and supplies to make them. She now has three small sales kiosks in the market and has built up around $4,500 in working capital. Mariya has an extensive history of working with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. She has successfully repaid a total of 23 loans with no delinquencies.\r\n\r\nBeing the entrepreneur that she is, Mariya is always ready to explore new opportunities. Eventually, she would like to open her own indoor store facility which will enable her to diversify her products and in turn generate more profits. \r\n\r\nMariya is requesting a loan for $1,000 that she can use to buy more embroidery tools and supplies. She believes that through her business and the products she offers at the market she can encourage the re-birth of Ukrainian embroidery and meet the basic needs of her family.

is a single mother raising her 15 year old son on her own.  She has extensive experience in retail which led her to start her own business selling children\u2019s clothing. She manages two retail locations, one in the central market and another outside the city. Most of the income Maria has earned has been put back into business development. After three years in operation, the business currently yields around $400 a month with an investment of $1,000 in inventory. \r\n\r\nThe approaching spring season means increased buyer activity. After a long winter, many Ukrainians are ready to get out and shop. Irina recognizes a good opportunity to broaden the selection of goods she offers and increase her sales volume. She is requesting a loan of $700 to purchase a variety of spring children\u2019s clothing that will increase her available inventory. Irina is known as an open and lively woman who cares about her customer\u2019s needs. As she provides for the needs of others, she will be able to generate the necessary funds to adequately provide for herself and her son.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0406\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013

is married with two children. She always wanted to be an entrepreneur and saw many opportunities everywhere she looked. Irina decided on a small business selling clothing and footwear for women and today she runs a vending kiosk in one of the local markets. Currently, Irina has about $4,000 of working capital in her business and she makes about $600 a month in net profit.  \r\n\r\nIrina is very cheery and optimistic. Her radiant smile and ability to make her clients feel welcome at her kiosk attracts many potential customers and helps her business grow. Irina has been a client with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d since 2002.  \r\n\r\nIrina is requesting a loan for $1,000 to open a new vending facility where she would like to begin selling shoes.

After finishing her schooling she worked in a factory as a metal turner then later worked at an enterprise producing glass fiber. However, she was unable to earn a stable salary which forced her to look for another source of income. That is why she started her own business selling clothing and footwear for women. She has been in this business since 2001.   \r\n\r\nValentina is very polite and competent. She is highly respected among other entrepreneurs in the local market. Convenient locations for her two vending facilities and the trendy clothing and high quality, durable footwear she sells have helped her business be successful. Presently, she has about $2,400 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to around $400. \r\n\r\nValentina is requesting a loan for $1,000 to increase her inventory. She is planning to purchase seasonal footwear, sweaters, jumpers, skirts and pants. We believe her responsible attitude, entrepreneurial experience and top-rate service will help her succeed in business, promote stable growth of her sales and generate enough funds to provide for her

is a divorced mother of one daughter. She first became an entrepreneur 12 years ago when she started working in one of the local markets selling women\u2019s clothing. However, soon her sales began to go down so she decided to change locations and start a new venture in the busiest city market. She received a loan from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d, bought a kiosk and went to work. Today Irina runs a prosperous small business selling seasonal clothing for women.\r\n\r\nIrina has proven to be a successful entrepreneur. She is very active, loves challenges and is continuously seeking new opportunities. Irina is very passionate about her work \u2013 she lives every minute of her life to its fullest. At the same time, she is very responsible and has repaid every loan from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d without any delinquencies. \r\n\r\nIrina would like to get a loan for $500 to purchase a new vending facility in the central city market. She is planning to do some necessary reconstruction work and buy an assortment of new inventory in bulk. Irina thinks that a variety of good quality knitted wear, sweaters, jerseys, and T-shirts will sell well and will attract many potential customers to her business. We believe that Irina\u2019s entrepreneurial ambition, hard work and optimistic attitude in combination with financial assistance will promote the further growth of Irina\u2019s business and will

2003, Tatyana has had a small business selling women\u2019s lingerie. She is divorced and has one son. The business is the main source of income for her and her son. Tatyana acknowledges that through her experience she has learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of business. \r\n\r\nHer resolution and determination in her work have helped her learn flexibility and develop qualities like patience, perseverance and customer-friendliness. Tatyana\u2019s ability to learn her customer\u2019s preferences and tastes has helped her be more effective in her trade and achieve sales success.   \r\n\r\nTatyana is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase a vending facility and begin construction of a kiosk. She is also planning to use some money to re-stock her inventory so she can increase her sales.

K. is 36-years old, married and has one child. Linus has no secondary school certificate, but when he came to Nairobi, he decided not to be idle. He first worked as a casual laborer for several construction firms. While working he managed to save Ksh 2,000.00 ($29), which he used to buy a shaving machine and some combs. Unfortunately he was dismissed from his casual duties after the construction firm closed its doors. He was then employed as a guard at Ayany estate, the up-market part of Kibera, where he saved Ksh 3,000.00 ($42). With this, he was able to rent a small room where he operates a barbershop. At night he works as a guard, and during the day he operates his barbershop. From the barbershop profits, he started a water-selling point (place to buy water). In 2005, Linus added two more water selling points. The Government of Kenya's vision is that by the year 2030, every Kenyan will have access to clean water. Linus' water-selling projects help provide clean and safe water to the residents of Kibera, which decreases water borne diseases by a big margin.\r\n\r\nBeing a very hard working and determined person with a vision of business expansion, Linus wants to start selling clean water ice cubes. These are rectangular-shaped ice blocks used mostly by shopkeepers and fishmongers as a cooling agent since they do not own refrigerators.

Part of her loan will be used to enlarge her piggery, and she intends to continue with her mobile restaurant.

resides at Mtakuja in the Ilala District of  Dar es Salaam. She is married and has five children. One is in primary school,three are in secondary school and the others are in kindergarten. Yokunda owns a retail shop selling various consumable items. She has operated the shop for more than six years now. She recently realized that her profit margin has been declining due to the increased number of competitors in the area. In a plan to improve her profit margin, Yokunda has decided to add some items in her shop that her competitors do not have. She also plans to open another shop on the next street.
