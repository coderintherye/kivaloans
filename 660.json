key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His wife and children help him with this business.  Haknazar requested a loan in the sum of $3000 for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.  This would allow him to make a large profit, which would in turn, allow to improve his family's quality of life.  In the future, he wants to expand his land for sowing and, thus, provide his children with their own business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800.13,"image":{"id":857026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of seeds and mineral fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haknazar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":976.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1001.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1022.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":976.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1001.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1022.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":991.19,"local_amount":991.19,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":991.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250812069,"comment":null},{"amount":1808.94,"local_amount":1808.94,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1808.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263580704,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T02:04:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":330656,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is a 33-year-old, widowed mother of four children.

for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It takes a lot of effort, both physical and mental.\r\n\r\nVictor considers himself a fighting, self-sacrificing, honest and above all very responsible man. He has many customers who regularly buy the items he sells. One of Victor's dreams is to have his own premises where he can sell his goods, because then he would have more time and not have to travel so much.\r\n\r\nThe loan Victor has requested will be used to purchase haberdashery and certain types of medicines to boost his supplies and meet his customers' needs.

They live in the Huancal - Huaricolca town.\r\nHer vitality and and courage are demonstrated in her successes. She is proud of her oldest daughter, Mily, age 25, who just finished nursing school; like Mily, two of her brothers are professionals. Despite her limitations, Rosalia was able to pay for her children's university studies. All of this is thanks to her crops of potato, ulluco, barley and oats, which bring her a good income. Currently her harvests are very sought-after in the city's central market. And, as the hard-working woman that she is, during agricultural seasons she travels to the cities of Lima, Chanchamayo and Masamari to sell her tubers wholesale, and to sell vegetables at retail prices. However, the agricultural seasons do not last all year, so this bright woman has several heads of ovine and bovine livestock which helps her to cover some costs. For the future, she is planning to expand her livestock business through improving her animal farm. She belongs to the \"Nueva Esperanza\" [\"New Hope\"] Communal Bank, and this is her tenth loan with MFP. In MFP she is known in her communal bank as a responsible person, and because of this she occupies an important position in the group. She promises to be punctual with her quotas. Rosalia plans to purchase 50 bags of potato seeds of the Yungay, Unica and Canchan variety.

She has lived with Cancio, her husband, for 21 years. Together they have 6 children, but only 5 live with them. They have their own home in the town of Huaricolca. Their goal is to see their children become professionals and to set them off in the right direction. With this in mind, they have worked diligently for 21 years sowing potatoes, peas, and oats. Thanks to their constant care, this generates them a good income. However, during water shortages they are unable to sow. Adelia takes advantage of this time to sell the milk that their two Mantona cows produce. In doing this, she ensures her family's economic stability. In addition, they have several heads of sheep, which they sell after fattening them.\r\n\r\nA good mother, Adelia is always thinking about putting food on her children's table. She also raises small animals such as guinea pigs, hens, and hogs, whose meat they eat. However, she sees that they grow well and she plans to sell them and to open a ranch for all kinds of livestock. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \"Nueva Esperanza\" [\"New Hope\"] Communal Bank, and this is her second loan with MFP.

She is a member of the solidarity group called \u201cFive 2\u201d. She is married and her husband is a farmer. She has two children and together they live in the El Cinco Community in the Olanchito municipality. For the past two years Maria has sold clothes and sandals. She learned the business thanks to one of her friends, who is in the same business. Her friend recommended that Maria buy the necessary supplies, which the company sold to her at a good price. Her business doesn\u2019t have a name, as she is a roving salesperson. Early in the morning she begins selling in the streets of their community and in neighboring communities. Her main difficulty is not the weather, as even if it is raining or hot she always goes out to try to earn sales in order to support her family. Maria is asking for this loan in order to buy a variety of clothes for children, women and men. She wants to buy the latest styles and clothes for the rainy climate.

She is very talented and most of her customers recommend her to other people, which helps a lot in terms of marketing for her business.\r\nAliya is requesting a loan from Al Majmoua-Kiva partner for the first time to buy necessary tools and materials to prepare wedding souvenirs.\r\nAliya hopes she can open a small shop in the future and buy a new tailoring machine which would be better than the small one she's using. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":480,"image":{"id":857685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy necessary tools and materials for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-08-30T07:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aliya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731315,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534845,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494373,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702473,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299412,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317517,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-30T19:18:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":330944,"name":"Bernabas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernabas is a 38-year-old man who is married to Frederika.

has applied for a loan from Kiva partner HKL for the betterment of her fruit-selling business. She sells different varieties of fruit in the market. She is very fair in her rates and makes good sales every day. She always gets up early in the morning to go the market because the market is far away from her house. \r\n\r\nDue to the long distance, she decided to buy a motorbike. She lacks money, so she would like to request some funding from HKL's partnership with Kiva.  She will use this funding to buy a motorbike to transport her fruit to the market in time. She will also use a part of the money to purchase more fresh seasonal fruit. \r\n\r\nShe is very experienced in her business and has been operating it for the past 6 years. Nao is confident about the positive growth of her business after the loan investment. She is the mother of ten children. Six of them are already married and live independently and the other four are enrolled in school.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has been involved in buying and selling of men's trousers, suits and shirts.  When he first obtain a loan in the sum of $600 from Imon International, he made a good profit, and then he gradually began increasing his loan amounts.  Last year, when the market burned down, Imon International did not demand interest, but instead supported him by extending his repayment term, so that he could repay his loan without any difficulties.  Now, Mukhamed wants to obtain another loan, which would help him to buy a lot of goods at low prices, then sell them at retail prices and make a good profit.  He is grateful to Imon International and Kiva for the support and mercy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":707.93,"image":{"id":857800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase merchandise for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukhamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":106.68},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":114.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":114.35},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":116.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":121.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":122.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":129.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":138.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.35},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.73,"local_amount":116.73,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-19T08:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":116.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233368505,"comment":null},{"amount":115.06,"local_amount":115.06,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":115.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238643640,"comment":null},{"amount":114.6,"local_amount":114.6,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":114.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244598076,"comment":null},{"amount":116.57,"local_amount":116.57,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":116.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250812073,"comment":null},{"amount":121.78,"local_amount":121.78,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":121.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257220760,"comment":null},{"amount":123.19,"local_amount":123.19,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":123.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263580708,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-29T05:35:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":331009,"name":"Andresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Andresa is 45 years old and is widowed with two children.

is a 45-year-old farmer who lives in his own house with two children.  Adrian, 20, is studying in Local University and Indra, 17, is studying at the 2nd grade of Senior High School. His wife passed away a year ago, so Yakob is responsible of taking care of his children. Yakob has a plot of land that supports him by generating money. He cultivates paddy and corn at the farm. Due to the limited irrigation, Yakob could not generate much money from the harvest.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Yakob is planning to try another business: he would like to buy crops such as rice, corns, pumpkins, green beans, bananas, and cassavas from other farmers and then resell them in local markets. \r\n\r\nYakob is seeking a loan of 10,000,000 from TLM to purchase these crops. He is hoping that TLM will assist him by providing a loan for his business.

and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
