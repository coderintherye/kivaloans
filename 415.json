O. is a 34-year-old father of two who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. The rural zone where Noel and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Noel is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor.\r\n\r\nNoel is a dedicated farmer and father. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of tabasco peppers. He works in cooperation with his wife to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Noel works at a local orange-processing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement the family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and food.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Noel and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of tabasco peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Noel with the help of his family members. Noel will need roughly one year before his peppers reach maturity and are ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the mornings, the domestic tasks are carried out: cooking, cleaning and sending the children to school. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvesting, planting, and working the land as needed. Noel spends some days working as a laborer in the nearby orange-processing factory but this work is sporadic.\r\n\r\nNoel says the main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Noel, his family and his community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Noel wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":555082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients necessary to the production of tabasco peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coquital, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":31971.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":32504.49},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33046.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33597},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":34156.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":34723.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.13,"local_amount":26066.7,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":27604.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411579,"comment":null},{"amount":23.2,"local_amount":11600,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":12284.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551336,"comment":null},{"amount":13.4,"local_amount":6701.8,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7097.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148755,"comment":null},{"amount":4.02,"local_amount":2008,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2126.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428372,"comment":null},{"amount":307.25,"local_amount":153623.5,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":162687.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970505,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T21:44:39Z","paid_date":"2011-03-25T09:18:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208098,"name":"Srouy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group, which consists of four members, is located in Tuol Sala village in Kandal province.

L., 53 years old, lives in the province of Kompong Tom, Cambodia, where she owns and farms a plot of land next to her house, raising pigs and crops to earn a living. She crops twice a year, and she was taught how to raise pigs and farm by her grandfather. She is a good mother and has four children. Two children are now married and live away from home, while the other two are single. Her husband works on the farm with her. L. doesn\u2019t have enough supplies to use on the field during this coming rainfall season.

The land they work is their own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Arnulfo works at a local orange-processing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement his family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and food.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Arnulfo and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of tabasco and cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Arnulfo with the help of his family members. Arnulfo will need roughly one year before his peppers reach maturity and are ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market.\r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the mornings, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and sending the children to school. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvesting, planting, and working the land as needed. Arnulfo spends some days working as a laborer in the nearby orange-processing factory, but this work is sporadic.\r\n\r\nArnulfo says the main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Arnulfo, his family and his community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Arnulfo wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":555098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

R. is a 49-year-old pepper farmer and father of two who lives in the region of Medio Queso de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. The rural zone where Nicasio and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Nicasio is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour.\r\n\r\nNicasio is a dedicated farmer and father. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of tabasco peppers. He works in cooperation with his wife to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Nicasio works at a local orange-processing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement his family\u2019s income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and food.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Nicasio and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All members of the Medio Queso community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of tabasco peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Nicasio with the help of his family members. Nicasio will need roughly one year before his peppers reach maturity and are ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Medio Queso, thus ensuring that their products will reach market.\r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the mornings, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and sending the children to school. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvesting, planting, and working the land as needed. Nicasio spends some days working as a laborer in the nearby orange-processing factory but this work is sporadic.\r\n\r\nThe main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Medio Queso region as legitimate producers worthy of financial and governmental support and services. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Nicasio, his family and his community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Nicasio wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":555105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients necessary for the production of peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Medio Queso, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicasio Arsenio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":545000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":87122.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":88574.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":90050.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":91551.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":93077.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":94622.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":0.06,"local_amount":33.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":34.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411582,"comment":null},{"amount":25.18,"local_amount":13070.9,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":13334.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551339,"comment":null},{"amount":9.95,"local_amount":5166.4,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5270.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148758,"comment":null},{"amount":472.62,"local_amount":245312.71,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":250252.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158200,"comment":null},{"amount":374.36,"local_amount":194309.73,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-28T07:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":198222.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227043869,"comment":null},{"amount":167.83,"local_amount":87106.76,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":88860.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232804906,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-22T15:50:37Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:08:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208117,"name":"Farzana's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farzana lives with her family in Multan, Pakistan, a city of tombs and holy places.

Now the rickshaw needs maintenance; otherwise, its engine will seize up.\r\n \r\nMansab has applied for a loan from Asasah which will be used for overhauling and maintaining her husband\u2019s rickshaw. A newly maintained rickshaw will help him make more money because he will be able to work for greater periods of time and can work more

With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, lifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to improve her business so that she can continue to save up for future house improvement.

Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. \r\n\r\nQuirwin is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.

Hasan is a 47-year-old married man who owns a small farm. He is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults thanks to his example.\r\n\r\nHasan runs a business raising and selling cattle and has ten years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, he has become a very successful businessman in a very short period. He works very hard and spends all his time with his animals cleaning, feeding and pasturing them.\r\n\r\nNow, Hasan wants to expand his business and buy more cattle, so he applied for a loan of 12,000 Somoni. He thanks all lenders for their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mukaram is 53 years old. She is divorced and has one child. For many years she tried various types of the activities. Finally, three years ago together with her son she started a business selling cell phones. Mukaram believes that this business is profitable and the generated income allows her to support her family. \r\n\r\nHowever, Mukaram thinks that it is expensive to purchase the cell phones locally and it will save funds considerably to purchase the goods in China. For this purpose Mukaram requests 5,100 Somoni. Being a first time borrower, Mukaram is grateful to all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has 12 years of experience in this field. \r\n\r\nSince cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Ahmadshekh has become a very successful businessman. Ahmadshekh has a friendly family who always try to help each other. He works very hard and spends his weekend time with the cattle, cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. Now Ahmadshekh wants to expand his business and buy more cattle. So for that he applied for a loan of 7,000 Somoni.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Albert was born in the capital of BURUNDI (Bujumbura) in the district of Kibitoki. He was in Burundi as a Rwandan refugee, and he returned to his country of origin in 1995, after the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi in 1994. He is 28, single, and managed to finish 6 years of primary school.  \n\nHe does business in the center of the town of NYAMATA, as a retailer with a little shop. His home is somewhat rural, so he also plants sorghum, beans, and manioc for his family's day-to-day consumption.  \n\nThis is his first loan with ACB, and he used it to buy inventory for his business, with which he hopes to become rich. This loan of 500,000 Rwandan francs served to buy maize flour, sugar, soap, and sodas (Fanta) so that he can increase his turnover and continue to make progress, especially economically speaking. He says that his ambition is to reimburse his loan well so that the Bank will accord him a larger amount and he can buy a lot of items so as to increase the profit from his business and become a wholesaler. \n\nIn the future he intends to improve his business by buying more products and improve his living conditions. Apart from that, he intends to have a wife and children and a good household later on so as to reconstruct his country. \n\n\n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":555334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of soap, maize flour, and beans to stock his shop better","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Nyamata-Bugesera","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126656.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151836787,"comment":null},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":126656.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159577525,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":253312.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788080,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-18T19:57:30Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208257,"name":"Costa Alegre Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las mencionadas mujeres son de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda Caba\u00f1as (Costa Alegre) de la Ciudad de Caacupe. \nSon Se\u00f1oras, que trabajan en su mayor\u00eda en la producci\u00f3n  y venta de plantas en sus propios hogares, se dedican al cultivo y venta de plantas a gran escala. \n Una de ellas es la se\u00f1ora Florentina,  quien sale de madrugada de su hogar  y viaja con sus plantas para comercializarlos en distintos puntos del pa\u00eds, la gran mayor\u00eda viaja en condiciones precarias   por falta de veh\u00edculos propios.\nGracias a la ayuda de su familia en esta actividad cubren todos los gasto de la familia, y solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de semillas, bolsas para macetas y abonas, todo para una mejor y mayor producci\u00f3n de plantas.","en":"The women mentioned in this description are from the Caba\u00f1as (Costa Alegre) Group in the city of Caacupe.

She and her husband work with plants all day to provide them good conditions so that they can be sold in different cities.  The work is very tiring, but it has enabled her to provide her children an education so that they lack nothing.  Salvadora wants to increase her sales and production, as well as make a few improvements to her home.

Only three of the kids live with them, and the older ones work on their own and help them financially. Alfredo is considered one of the biggest and best producers of pineapple in the central forest of Peru, which he has been doing for four years. Along with this, he also works as a motorcycle mechanic, but for the moment he had to close his workshop because he changed addresses. His wife teaches religious studies at a high school. During the time Alfredo works in the fields, one of the the things he likes best is to maintain clean rows of pineapple trees so they all receive the same amount of nutrients necessary for their development. However, he has to pay exuberant prices to transport his products to the capital, too much it seems to him.

","en":"43 year old Dora lives in her own house along with her husband, Hugo, who is 47, and their four children, who are her reason for living. As she is a good mother, she always wants to be able to offer them the best. She has been working in agriculture for five years, growing coffee, bananas, and avocados. However, as she is at home most day looking after her kids, some months ago she started a business selling petrol from a space in her home. This has brought her considerable income. Meanwhile, her husband works offering transportation services, transporting people in his own car, so they both contribute to paying the family expenses. At the weekend, she and her children and some workers clear and fertilize her crops, and they never neglect to do this because it is a very profitable activity.

","en":"Born in 1963 in Allada in the Atlantique department, Dokodji Christine S. is married to Calixte GNASSA, a carpenter. The couple has four children, all of whom attend school. The family settled in the Gbow\u00e8l\u00e8 district of Allada about five years ago. Christine contributes to family expenses, thanks to the income generated by her business. Christine did not go to school. In order to meet her needs, Christine sells various products (liqueurs, fabrics, underwear, etc.) in Allada. Christine purchases her products in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Christine has been in this trade for fifteen years and has already received a loan from ALID\u00e9 which has been entirely repaid. Christine can no longer satisfy rising customer demand for fabrics, given the limited resources that she has.

It is part of the province of Lambayeque and is located 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. Carmen made a living for a number of years selling fresh fish in her district's local market. She used the income she made to install a convenience store in her home. This business provides her with permanent income, since selling fish was only seasonal. Carmen gives her best every day to maintain the business and make headway for her family, providing quality products and good customer service. She wishes to acquire more products to increase her store's inventory, and in this way increase her sales along with her profits. To reach this goal she is requesting a loan of 1000 from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa for the first time. Carmen is a enterprising woman who is very devoted to her family. She wants to continue replenishing her store to ensure her profits, which allow her to provide her family with a better quality of life and a good education for her children.

Together they have three children, only one of whom lives with them in the home they own. The eldest ones are studying in the city of Lima in search of a higher education. The necessity of helping her family increase their income pushed Francisca to start selling candies, cookies, caramels, soft drinks and products of primary need. Her husband works as a mechanics technician at a mining plant, covering household expenses and their children's education, so his job is lucrative. Equally, Francisca's business allows them to live comfortably with out worries. It doesn't bother her that she wakes up early every day because she's sure that all her sacrifices will be rewarded in the profits she makes. Now she hopes to save enough to acquire a post in the main market in the city of San Ram\u00f3n, where she plans to sell meat and other food products at retail and wholesale. This is the third time she has requested a loan from Kiva partner MFP, and she feels proud of being part of a very well-run group that likes to save and cares about every one of its members and their progress. With the loan she is requesting, Francisca plans to purchase a larger quantity of merchandise such as primary-need and perishable items to stimulate her sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":555482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase various products to better stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-17T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":164}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.23,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":174.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673455,"comment":null},{"amount":61.24,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":174.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887276,"comment":null},{"amount":61.23,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":174.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154285,"comment":null},{"amount":61.23,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":174.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449587,"comment":null},{"amount":61.24,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":174.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588283,"comment":null},{"amount":61.23,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":174.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724781,"comment":null},{"amount":61.23,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":174.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462979,"comment":null},{"amount":61.24,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":174.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886502,"comment":null},{"amount":60.13,"local_amount":164,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":170.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326830,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T14:10:03Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208303,"name":"Jennifer Johanna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jennifer de 25 a\u00f1os, vive en Duran (per\u00edmetro urbano fue originalmente irregular, con varios cerros, riachuelos y lagunas que a\u00fan se presentan como restos de una ecolog\u00eda en disoluci\u00f3n) de Guayaquil, ella reparte almuerzos a casi todo el sector de Duran. \n\nElla desde muy joven empez\u00f3 a estudiar y como era una ni\u00f1a muy aplicada la becaron en la universidad, al pasar el tiempo ella recibi\u00f3 un premio en dinero por su buen desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico, y lo invirti\u00f3 en alimentos para hacer su propio negocio.

Together they have five children and live in a very comfortable rented home and well situated for the work that she does and that she would not be allowed to do in the center of the city.  For the wellbeing of their children, Rita and her husband make bricks in a workshop that is in front of their residence.  Independantly, she has a workshop for making fireworks, which are in high demand for the patron saint festivals that occur in her city.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, her spouse is a musician.  This is also profitable and even allows her to save, since her goal is to buy her own house and to set up a restaurant.  She has done all of this work for 15 years and it is thanks to these activities that her children never went hungry.  \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP and she is happy to continue working with the members of her communal group, who are very supportive, warm, and responsible.

Only one daughter is living with her, and she works and takes care of all of her personal expenses.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years, Ana Vilma has had a stand in the Due\u00f1as market located in the Santa Tecla municipality.  Here she sells traditional Salvadorian dishes, like plantains served in sugar cane honey, and a Salvadorian atol [a thick, masa based drink] called \u201cchilate,\u201d made of toasted ma\u00edz.  She also makes other dishes like nu\u00e9gados, which are little balls made of yucca, and many other foods that are made sweet.  Since only the atoll is called \u201cchilate,\u201d people call all of the other dishes mentioned \u201cchilate\u201d to generalize.  These snacks are very popular, especially when they have great flavor like the ones Vilma makes.  She has many years of experience that have allowed her to become very well known in this place, where she has many customers.  \r\n\r\nAna wants to invest more in her business by purchasing larger quantities of primary ingredients to make more traditional plates.  In this way, she will improve her earnings and at the same time be able to pay all of her household expenses.

With this loan Sara will buy ingredients necessary for her food.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":555576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase ingredients and prepare food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-17T11:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":112}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":118.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673457,"comment":null},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":118.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887278,"comment":null},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":118.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154287,"comment":null},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":118.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449589,"comment":null},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":118.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588285,"comment":null},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":118.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724783,"comment":null},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":118.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462981,"comment":null},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":118.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886504,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":112,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":119.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326832,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T17:05:23Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208326,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hilda, de 36 a\u00f1os, vive en una casa alquilada con su pareja Jos\u00e9 (40), y sus  2 peque\u00f1os hijos.Desde hace 2 a\u00f1os se inicio en el negocio de venta de productos de belleza; tambi\u00e9n alquila retroproyectores para cualquier evento que lo requiera, mientras su esposo labora como empleado en una empresa.

She also rents out retro projectors for any event that needs them, while her husband works as an employee in a business. What Hilda likes the most is recommending what type of beauty product would most favor her customers. On the other hand, it bothers her when she trusts people and sells them a product on credit and they don't pay on the agreed upon day. That is why now she sells via the catalogs.  She is sure that her earnings will double because she will buy perfume and products at a special price and later sell them at a normal price according to the sales campaign. In the future, she wants to have a business in the house where she lives selling electrical cables and sockets. In time, she wants to turn it into a hardware store.  This is the first time that she has had a loan with MFP and she is happy that the financial entity is putting its trust in her and has bet on the work that she does to give her the loan.

She is single and has 3 children who work independently, but they all live together in her own home.  She is considered to be a mother who can succeed doing any kind of task.   Currently she has a business selling food.  In addition, she has a recreation area for tourists called \"Los Girasoles\" which is open every afternoon.  And as if this wasn't enough, she also works in agriculture on the weekends.  She has lands where she grows citrus fruit, which she later sells wholesale.  She has 25 years of experience in these activities, and what she enjoys most is to enjoy the tranquility she feels in the area where she lives.  Through her years of experience she has found that these activities are quite profitable, since they have allowed her to build her house, pay for the education of her children and live comfortably with all the necessities.  Also, one of her daughters studied in the \"Hotel and Tourism\" career, since she is thinking of putting a hotel on some vacant land that she has.  She also wants one of her daughters to travel outside the country to look for work, so that she can search for a better quality of life.  This is her 3rd loan with MFP, and since she knows the members of her communal bank she feels at home since she has a lot of confidence in her fellow members.  With the loan she requests, she will buy a number a cases of beer and soft drinks to stock her bar.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":555588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy soft drinks to stock her store  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-17T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":224}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.47},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.47},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.47},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.47},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.48,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673459,"comment":null},{"amount":80.47,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887280,"comment":null},{"amount":80.48,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154289,"comment":null},{"amount":80.47,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449590,"comment":null},{"amount":80.48,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588287,"comment":null},{"amount":80.47,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724785,"comment":null},{"amount":80.48,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462983,"comment":null},{"amount":80.47,"local_amount":222,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":228.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886506,"comment":null},{"amount":81.2,"local_amount":224,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":230.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326834,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-24T02:32:18Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208332,"name":"Walter","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Walter, de 33 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa propia junto a su pareja Nelly (29), con quien tiene 4 peque\u00f1os  hijos.Desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, se dedica  a la siembra de papa, habas, alverja, ma\u00edz y verduras, pues esta actividad le ha permitido comprar sus terrenos, construir su vivienda y solventar las necesidades de su familia.

H. T. is a 19-year-old pepper producer who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. Isaac is a dedicated producer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of Cayenne peppers. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. In general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting \u2013 working the land as needed. The land they work is their own.\r\n\r\n In addition to his agricultural activity, Isaac spends some days working as a labourer in the nearby orange producing factory in order to supplement the family income, but this work is sporadic. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and buys food. The rural zone where Isaac and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Isaac is working hard for the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Isaac and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole. This loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labour and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Isaac with the help of his family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Isaac will need roughly one year before his peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest. \r\n\r\nThe main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity for Isaac, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, there is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Isaac wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighbourhood. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":555658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For the purchase of seeds and nutrients necessary for the production of peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coquital, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":31971.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":32504.49},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33046.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33597},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":34156.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":34723.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208368,"name":"Lumbi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lumbi R.

He is 47 years old and married with four children between the ages of 1\u00bd and 20. Three of his children are currently attending school.\r\n<p>\r\nSamwel has been practicing mixed farming for 22 years and has employed two people from his community. His products are maize, beans, tea, coffee, and pineapples, which he sells to the local market. He relies on the income from farming to cater for the family's basic needs.\r\n<p>\r\nHis major challenges in this business are too much rainfall, which destroys his crops, and lack of fertilizers during the planting season.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 45,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if they are delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is Primitiva E.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nPrimitiva is married to Lerio E., a motor cab driver. They are blessed with five children of whom two are already married and three are now adults.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Primitiva decided to engage in a micro-business, particularly in operating a sari-sari (variety) store and some farming activity. For a year, already, she has been able to maintain the said business activity and now she is earning an average net income of not less than P3,000 a month which is so helpful to their family income.\r\n\r\nPrimitiva joined the Cooperative in 2009. As an active member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) Program of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting an amount of P10,000 as her 3rd loan. Part will be used in purchasing commercial fertilizers and the remaining amount added to the capital of her sari-sari store.\r\n\r\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of Primitiva\u2019s family, to meet their basic needs, for loan repayments to PMPC, and for possible business expansion.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":542479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase commercial fertilizers and to use as additional capital for her sari-sari store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"P3 Cabunga-an, Clarin, Mis.

This has been the bedrock for the growth of 40-year-old K.

The official name of this borrowing group is Juana P.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nJuana is married to Generoso P. who is a driver who earns an average income of not less than P170.00. They are blessed with eight children, five of whom are already married, one is single and two are in their teens. To help her husband, she decided to engage in micro-business particularly in snack vending and RTW (GTY products) dealing activity.  For 10 years, she has been able to maintain this business activity and she is earning an average net income of not less than P1,000.00 a month. \r\n\r\nThis amount has been so helpful to their family income that she joined PMPC in 2007. As an active member of the PDP-LP Program of PMPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out the rural poor, she is requesting an amount of P6,000.00 as her fifth loan to be used for purchasing additional piglets for her piggery and for house repairs. The future income from this loan will be used to improve her family's living conditions, to meet their basic needs, loan repayments to PMPC and for possible business expansion.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":548696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase piglets for her piggery and for house repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Catadman, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":480},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":480}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208422,"name":"Men","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Men P. is a 42-year-old resident of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, where she earns a living by selling flowers for ceremonies and other parties at the local busy market.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as snack foods, cooking oil, soy sauce, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Charlyn has been engaged in her business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Charlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Charlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from GDMPC. Charlyn is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Charlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n \r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Agar has been engaged in her business for over 1 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Agar joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Agar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to additional capital for her business. Agar is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Agar from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has been incumbent upon her to nurture, clothe, educate and provide food to them. This business has in many ways been her recourse despite the paltry 800,000 shillings she makes in a month. Paltry in the sense that she also has relatives looking up to her.\r\n\r\nCombining the two tasks has been a tall order but, thanks to her pragmatic and philosophical attitude towards issues, she has made lots of headway. What has also helped has been the fact that she has been eking out other invaluable profits from her farming business. She started off her business journey with a now-closed hardware shop.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, N. wants to principally purchase more cosmetics and other popular retail goods for her shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":555933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more cosmetics and other retail items for her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-19T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nadima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadija","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane Francis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorothy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":9100000,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2275000},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2275000},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2275000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2275000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1012.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1012.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1012.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1012.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1012.5,"local_amount":2275000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2275593.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689369,"comment":null},{"amount":1002.71,"local_amount":2253000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2253588.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903519,"comment":null},{"amount":1022.29,"local_amount":2297000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2297599.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296992,"comment":null},{"amount":1012.5,"local_amount":2275000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2275593.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467276,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T22:37:56Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208446,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 46-year old single man from Lebanon.

This has, to a great degree, lent her that survival countenance in her seven-year-old hardware business in Zana, Kampala.\r\n\r\nThe reason why most businesses around her locality have unraveled is because most people who embark on doing business don\u2019t have solid blueprint plans drawn up to help their businesses succeed, not only in the short run, but also in the long term. Most are just out to make quick profits. K. is an exception to this rule as she comes up with daily and end of month plans and objectives aimed at elevating her business.\r\n\r\nThis mother of three has showed her worth in a business sector dominated by men. To get where she is today, she had to start off small. She recalls with nostalgia her first business: clothes sales. With savings from this and with the support of her husband, she made her plans of owning and running a hardware shop come to fruition.\r\n\r\nIn a week, K. makes sufficient profits to the tune of 500,000 shillings. Her sense of optimism is sky high, knowing that, with this loan, she is going to make strides in terms of improving her business. She is anticipating purchasing items like paint and cement in bulk.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":555954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase items like paint and cement in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-19T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margeret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorothy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lillian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Margeret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":10300000,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2575000},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2575000},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2575000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2575000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2291.51,"local_amount":5131000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5150178.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689370,"comment":null},{"amount":1291.66,"local_amount":2892200,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2903010.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903520,"comment":null},{"amount":1016.83,"local_amount":2276800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2285310.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T00:07:26Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":208454,"name":"Nghiep","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nghiep T.
