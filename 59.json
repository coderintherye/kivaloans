Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

BRAC and BRAC Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

B., who is 58, is married and has 3 children. Emomali has been in the business of selling men's clothing for 3 years. For that reason, he rents a space in the market called \"Kovron\", in the city of Dushanbe, which is recognized as the biggest market in the country. He plans to use funds from the loan to purchase winter clothing, which he obtains directly from distributors. Because this market is visited by people from all over Tajikistan, they will have an opportunity to purchase his products at moderate prices as prices at \"Kovron\" are a lot lower than at other markets. Emomali plans to pay off the loan in 12 months. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432

Her first loan with TYM was used to cultivate vegetables which was a familiar work for her. Her income from selling vegetables was enough to cover her family living expenses.

H. is 36 and has a higher education in music.  He is married with four children.  Mahmadnazar works in a music conservatory.  He also provides his services as a wedding singer in the area.  He plans to use his loan to renovate his musical equipment and obtain some necessary spare parts.  In wedding season there are ceremonies almost every day.  Now newlyweds will have the chance to hire Mahmadnazar for a moderate price, instead of turning to artists from other regions, who charge higher prices due to transport costs.

Her husband is a cook who is going through a difficult patch right now, since he has been unable to find steady work. It is Mrs. N.'s little ambulant sales business that provides the income for the most urgent needs of the family. She is therefore asking for a loan of US$ 800 so that she can buy her products in bulk and thus assure a constant supply for re-sale. By retailing products that she has purchased at wholesale prices, she manages to earn enough of a profit margin to keep her family going. <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/B>Ag\u00e9e de 26 ans, Madame B\u00e9atrice N. est n\u00e9e \u00e0 Dapaong et r\u00e9side au quartier H\u00e9dzranawo\u00e9 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9 avec son mari.

Married with two children, he made the decision to seek a place to live and have a workshop.<p>\r\n\r\nThe money that he was able to save was enough to acquire land in the high area and he also bought some very rustic, small artisan weaving machines.

Now there are seven members of his household: him, his wife, their four children and his brother who came to the town and asked him for work.<p>\r\n\r\nHis artisan weavings are made with Alpaca, Ovino and Llama wool.  They have a good finish and it is because of this that his market is basically the exclusive areas of the capital that recognize the quality of the product and pay a fair price.
