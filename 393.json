Pedro is now married to Remigia, age 42, but they do not have any children together.\r\n<p>\r\nHe enjoys everything about farming, even more so because he knows that a good harvest is dependent on him and the care he provides to the land.  Pedro has been growing coffee and bananas for 40 years.  At the same time, he owns a grocery store that his wife manages.  His farming activities have been very profitable since they provide an adequate quality of life for his family.  However, he still feels he has a commitment to his children, so he plans to buy seven hectares of farmland near his home where he will grow corn, cassava, and bananas and then later give it to them as an inheritance.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.  Pedro says he enjoys working with his Communal Bank because the members are people who have known him for many years and respect his work.  With the loan of 1500 PEN that he requested, Pedro will buy five sacks of fertilizer for his crops.  He will also set aside part of the money to pay the workers he plans to hire.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":532083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertilizers & pay his workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-30T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1564.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886379,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-14T23:46:07Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197032,"name":"Pony","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pony, de 35 a\u00f1os, es un hombre soltero, vive en la casa de su madre, de 71 a\u00f1os, a quien cuida porque es una persona que ya no puede valerse por s\u00ed sola.\n\nEn los terrenos de su madre, \u00e9l planta caf\u00e9 desde muy ni\u00f1o, actividad que realiza s\u00f3lo, sin la ayuda de ning\u00fan familiar, pero para la plantaci\u00f3n, limpieza y cosecha contrata operarios.\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su labor es tener limpios sus terrenos, mientras por otro lado, le desagrada que a pesar de los esfuerzos que realiz\u00f3 la cosecha se retrase, como en la campa\u00f1a anterior donde no pudo recolectar a tiempo el caf\u00e9 porque no estaban desarrollados.\nSu actividad le es muy rentable porque le permite vivir c\u00f3modamente, sin pasar necesidades, adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 ahorrando para comprar una casa propia en la ciudad, as\u00ed como instalar un vivero para que renueve constantemente sus plantas.\n\nEste es el segundo pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y asegura que le gusta trabajar con su banco comunal porque est\u00e1 integrado por personas muy compresivas y exigentes en los pagos, que le ense\u00f1an a ser responsable.

O. is a small businesswoman who lives in a small town located on the northern coast of Colombia named Arjona, which is very close to the city of Cartagena de Indias.  In this town the main activities are agriculture, livestock production, the production of food products such as buns and corn and cheese fritters, and trade: especially the sale of garments, shoes and home furnishings. Maria P., 44, has a business called Variedades Mary.  She sells bed sheets, accessories, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, watches, perfumes, cosmetics, irons, pots, vases, and offers the community telephone call services.  She does this in the midst of the town's festivities, parades on horseback, pageants, and accordion festivals. She is an enterprising woman who started her small business 5 years ago.  It has gradually grown, driven by her desire to earn more money in order to finish building her house so that she can live there with her husband and her 3 children who are in school: one at the  secondary level and the other two at the university.  \r\n\r\nShe is currently seeking the support of a loan in the amount of 2 million Colombian pesos, which will allow her to invest in the purchase of merchandise such as shirts, sweaters, sandals, perfumes, dishes, pots, bed sheets, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and a new glass showcase.  This way she can deliver her orders more promptly and gain new customers and increase her income.  She wants to continue to invest little by little until she can finish her house, so she can save the money paid on rent, and have a dedicated space for her business that would improve its physical aspect and provide the space needed for its organization.  For Maria, one of her most important challenges in addition to finishing her house is to help her children become professionals, a goal that she will achieve with her effort in her small business, and with the support of her husband, who works as a driver.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

A large proportion of the younger population travels daily to Cuenca to work as factory employees, handicraft artisans, store employees, service workers and above all, construction workers. \n\nMar\u00eda Auxiliadora is  48 years old and lives with her two younger children, aged 15 and 12, who attend a nearby school. Her other four children are married and independent. Her husband is a mason, and through many years of sacrifice, he was able to build the family's own home in the Cumbe community. \n\nMar\u00eda Auxiliadora was one of the founding members of the communal bank, and she has been with the bank for fifteen years. She was inspired by a neighbor who belonged to an earlier group in the neighborhood which broke up. Later, this new group of hard-working and enterprising women was formed. Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora's business is buying and selling animals. She deals in guinea pigs and hens at the Cumbe markets and at Cuenca's public market. This activity has allowed her to advance economically. She has worked for 20 years in the markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and on the other days, she takes care of her animals. She also keeps cows, whose milk she sells to mobile distributors. With the current loan, she will buy more guinea pigs and hens to resell. \n\nHer goal is to expand her business day by day and reach the point where she can buy herself a vehicle. \n\nLuz Fern\u00e1ndez lives in the \"3 de Noviembre\" community of the Cumbe parish. She is  60 years old and was widowed 18 years ago when her husband was killed in a traffic accident. The couple had four children, who are now grown and married. Luz lives in her own house with one of her daughters who keeps her company and shares the household expenses. \n\nLuz works in agriculture; she grows corn, potatoes and a variety of vegetables. She also keeps cattle, selling the milk to mobile distributors. In addition, she raises guinea pigs and chickens. She tells us that she has been a member of the communal bank since its beginnings, that is, for the past 15 years. The loans have been beneficial for her business of buying and selling animals. With the new loan, she will buy chickens, guinea pigs and feed for her animals, as well as seeds for corn, beans, peas and other crops. \n\nHer goal is to continue working as long as her health permits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

The members of the bank live in different areas but their businesses are located in areas near the offices of Emprender.  The various products and services offered by the members include selling clothing, auto repair, making blankets, tailoring, and selling sporting goods.  \r\n\r\nRosa is one of the representatives of the communal bank and serves as its president.  She lives in two rented rooms in the Pampahasi area where she has lived since she was very young. She has a small sewing workshop and works primarily by hand as she receives cuts of fabric (fabric cut in quantity for businesses or small micro-businesses) for sewing and later delivery of garments. She learned this trade 7 years ago in Argentina where she lived for about two years. After returning, she got married and spent a year setting up her small workshop. The members of her family include her husband Nestor and her daughter Cielo who is 5 years old. One of her goals is to buy a house.  She would also like to better equip her workshop in order to have her own sewing customers.  The purpose of the loan is for the purchase of a sewing machine as one machine is not enough to handle her orders. \r\n\r\nRebeca is the bank\u2019s recording secretary.  She has been selling made to order blankets for one year.   The loan will be used to raise capital for the purchase of wool and necessary material. She says that she has been living with her husband for three years.  She was studying and selling flowers in the Rodrigues market, the most populous market in the city of La Paz, until her husband had an accident and she had to seek additional sources of income.  She learned to make blankets along with her mother-in-law which allowed her to cope with the problem she was experiencing.   At the time this happened, a year ago today, she was struggling to stabilize herself financially.  Her goal and dream is to have her own workshop with weaving machines and later have her own house and make progress along with her family. In her communal bank, she stands out as responsible, punctual in her payments, and very light-hearted, although she is quite young. \r\n\r\nAlejandrina, a new member, was elected as manager of the group based on leadership qualities which became evident during the loan process. She lives in Villa Salome in her mother-in-law\u2019s house in which she occupies two rooms and a small kitchen. She lives with her husband and three children. She has decided to start selling fruit to help her husband with the household expenses as two of her children are in school and need food and clothing. She works from 5:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening. The loan she is requesting will be used to raise capital to buy seasonal fruits.  One of her goals is to give her children a good education in life so that in the future they will pursue professional careers and will never lack anything. Later, she would like to be able to buy land for her family. \r\n\r\nAll members are responsible and hard-working individuals who have a desire for self-improvement and want to improve the quality of life for their whole family.  They are very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for trusting them with a loan. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eleanor Francoletti-Putz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":532206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":" TO PURCHASE A SEWING MACHINE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sergio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodrigo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14871.79,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1350.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1406.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1429.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1453.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1476.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1501.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1525.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1550.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1575.85},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1601.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.96},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.52},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1004.99,"local_amount":7117.11,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7138.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151880119,"comment":null},{"amount":211.96,"local_amount":1501.09,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1505.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151880120,"comment":null},{"amount":215.43,"local_amount":1525.61,"processed_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1530.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159620138,"comment":null},{"amount":218.94,"local_amount":1550.53,"processed_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1555.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159620139,"comment":null},{"amount":222.52,"local_amount":1575.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1580.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834556,"comment":null},{"amount":226.16,"local_amount":1601.6,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834557,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-13T21:31:54Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:04:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197099,"name":"Melenaite","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melenaite L. is 50 and married with 4 children.

N. L. is 35 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, selliN. pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Puamoto has 1 year of experience in this business.  Puamoto needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoriN., sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Puamoto joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Puamoto's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lendiN. is based upon the Grameen Bank lendiN. method.

Its principal commercial activities are farming and cattle-raising.  It is part of Lambayeque province and it is located an hour and fifteen minutes away from the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nFor over three years she has sold basic needs items and groceries in a store set up in her home.  She tends to the needs of her customers who always visit her establishment looking for items of daily consumption that they can\u2019t get conveniently because they are so far from the town of M\u00f3rrope.  The store provides income that helps her husband support the family because his earnings as a farmer aren\u2019t reliable.\r\n\r\nTheir home has been adversely affected by the rains that occurred these past few months.

Her economic activity is making aluminum pots. She has been performing this activity for more than 26 years. She started on her own. She would go out by herself to sell them after making a certain quantity. She would go through different places, offering her products.  They are very heavy, but despite this she won't stop fighting to improve her income and give her son everything he needs.  In this way, little by little, she has grown her business. She has always dreamed of having a workshop to generate more income for her family. The loan she is asking for is for working capital destined for the purchase of raw materials such as aluminum, molds and more. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

S. is 49 and married with 3 children (ages 5 - 18).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Tina has 2 years of experience in this business.  Tina needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tina joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

M. is 52 and married with 8 children (ages 5 - 24).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Atila has many years of experience in this business.  Atila needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Atila joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Atila's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

is 48 and married with 8 children (ages 6 - 14).  She owns a business venture, selling bamboo handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Lamosa has 3 years of experience in this business.  Lamosa needs a loan of WST $3250 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nLamosa joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lamosa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Most importantly, they have what it takes to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMasemia sells empanadas and soft drinks.  She also sells cosmetics by catalog.

In the near future she wants to be able to have her own house.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the women sell food, meat, hamburgers, cosmetics, or provide domestic services.  Some of the men work in passenger transportation, and the others are employed by the Guabira factory.  All of the members have many years of experience in their fields.\r\n\r\nThe competition in the market that the members work in is not high, but the sales are not very satisfactory.  Therefore, they see the need to change markets to be able to get better earnings.

Ailao A. is 35 and married with 5 children (ages 12 - 15).  She owns a business venture, baking & selling biscuits in the local community.  Rasela has 1 year of experience in this business.  Rasela needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase baking equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rasela joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Rasela's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

P. is 24 and married with 2 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Sina has 2 years of experience in this business.  Sina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sina joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

All of them live in their own homes.  Some time ago, she set up a business renting pool tables from a small section of her house.  Her other business is that of dressmaker, an activity she engages in sporadically.  This way, Gloria attends to her customers, offering good service to the young people who play on her premises.  This has paid off in earnings, for which she is proud.  For this reason she wishes to improve her facility and playing equipment, such as cue, billiard balls, and some well worn tables.  She would thus be able to offer more financial stability to her family.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she commits to being punctual once more in her payments.

SPBD's loans are Selesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Silomiga N. is 53 and married with 6 children (ages 10 - 29).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish.  Malia Silomiga has 3 years of experience in this business.  Malia Silomiga needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Malia Silomiga joined SPBD.   This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Malia Silomiga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 60 and widowed with 6 children (ages 21 - 37).  She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Saeni has 4 years of experience in this business.  Saeni needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Saeni joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saeni's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 52 and married with 4 children (ages 21 - 30).  She owns a business venture, providing clothing alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Faavae has 4 years of experience in this business.  Faavae needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase new sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 talas or US $117 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Faavae joined SPBD.  This is her 8th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faavae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 40 and married with 6 children (ages one month - 23).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Valeai has 5 years of experience in this business.  Valeai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Valeai joined SPBD.    This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Valeai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 36 and married with 2 children (ages 9 and 10).  She owns a business venture, selling donuts.  Lote has 3 years of experience in this business.  Lote needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase new items to expand her product offerings.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lote joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lote's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

L. is 45 and married with 2 children (ages 7 and 13).  She owns a business venture, driving a taxi.  Sela has 2 years of experience in this business.  Sela needs a loan of WST $1250 to renew vehicle license.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sela joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sela's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Lee L. is 47 and married with 3 children (ages 5 - 15).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Sefulu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sefulu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 talas or US $117 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sefulu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sefulu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She sells \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anticuchos\" target=\"_blank\" >anticuchos<\/a>\u201d with her sister, who is also a partner in the business.  They sell this dish, which is made of beef hearts and potatoes cooked in a chili sauce, at a bus depot where there is a large influx of people.  Their main customers are drivers, passengers, and residents of the area.  This business has proven to be profitable, and she hopes to eventually open her own restaurant where she can prepare and sell her delicious dishes.  However, she needs to continue working so that she can obtain the necessary capital to fulfill her dream.  For now, Etelvina wants to devote herself entirely to moving her family forward.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Etelvina promises to complete all of her payments on time.  The loan she requested will be used to purchase ingredients and a grill for preparing her dishes.  She also plans to acquire tables so that her customers will be more comfortable.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":532284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients, a grill, and tables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Etelvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":260.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144752034,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":521.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673258,"comment":null},{"amount":93.86,"local_amount":255.98,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":266.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887085,"comment":null},{"amount":89.47,"local_amount":244.02,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":254.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154098,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":260.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449372,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-01T22:23:50Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197159,"name":"Feiloaiga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Feiloaiga P. is 65 and married with 1 child.

S. is 41 and married with 1 child.  She owns a business venture, selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, plantains).  Talaleu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Talaleu needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Talaleu joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Talaleu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She lives in the Cebollar sector of San Pedro, which is known for its beautiful view of the city of Cuenca.  Most of its residents engage in agriculture while the young people look for better opportunities in the city.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa is 61 years old and has been separated from her spouse for three years.  Her husband abandoned her after she suffered from a stroke and became invalid.  Their marriage resulted in ten children, six of whom are married and live independently.  Rosa\u2019s other four children (ages 30, 27, 25, and 23) are single and live with her.  Her 30 year old daughter works at her own business manufacturing sportswear and helps with the household finances.  Her 27 year old son graduated with a degree in economics but has not yet secured a job.  Her 25 year old son attends the university and is in his fifth year studying architecture.  The youngest daughter is in her third year studying economics.  The fruit of Rosa\u2019s work has enabled her to build her own home.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa is dedicated to farming and selling grains and legumes.  She also raises chickens and pigs and helps her daughter with her business when she has free time.  Rosa is a founding member of her Communal Bank, which she helped to establish twelve years ago with one of her friends.  She says that the loans have benefited her by providing education for her children, a home, and a business for her daughter.  With her new loan, Rosa will buy fabric, thread, zippers, buttons, and supplies for producing the clothing that her daughter manufactures.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to help her daughter with purchasing a car to facilitate delivery of her garments.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":531592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase fabric, thread, zippers, buttons, and supplies for manufacturing sportswear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709086,"comment":null},{"amount":137.49,"local_amount":137.49,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":137.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892386,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632747,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846784,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113306,"comment":null},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":45.87,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":45.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406871,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-01T21:20:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197164,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria T. is 23 and single with 1 child (9 months old).

 T. is 44 and married with two children.

Tilomai  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tilomai joined SPBD.

P. is 40 and married with four children.  She owns a business, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Lini has three years of experience in this business.  Lini needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lini joined SPBD, and this is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 33 and married with three children.  She owns a business, providing clothing alteration and tailoring services to local community members.  Naomi has six years of experience in this business.  Naomi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nNaomi joined SPBD, and this is her third loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Naomi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Doris lives in the Pampa de la Isla area, an area that forms part of the town of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. She owns the house she lives in with her three children; she separated from her husband about 1 year ago: it has been difficult for her after they parted, but she managed to recover for the wellbeing of her children.

It is bordered in the north by Tarqui parish, in the east by Cumbe parish, in the south by the edge of Gir\u00f3n canton, and in the west by San Gerardo parish in Gir\u00f3n canton and Ba\u00f1os parish. One nearby attraction is El Portete de Tarqui, where there is a beautiful monument in honor of the heroes of the Battle of Tarqui, which took place on this site between the Peruvian army and the Ecuadorian army commanded by General Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre. \r\n\r\nBlanca is 36 years old and married. She is the mother of three children, aged 17, 15 and 4. Her two older children work in a vulcanizing plant, and they help a little with the household expenses. Her husband is a mason by trade, and he is currently building a house for the family. They are living in rented quarters for the moment. Blanca embroiders skirts; it was her father who taught her this attractive skill. She is also a domestic worker, and she works from Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Sometimes she is even called in to work until Sunday. \r\n\r\nShe is in her fourth loan cycle as a member of the communal bank, to which she was invited by her mother. The loans have been beneficial for her skirt business. The new loan will be invested in purchasing pigs, chickens and animal feed to start a new business. Her goal is to be able to have a store where she sells her skirts, and she hopes that God will grant her health so she can help her family get ahead. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":532126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying pigs, chickens and animal feed ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709087,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892387,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632748,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846785,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113307,"comment":null},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406872,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T04:03:08Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197177,"name":"Sera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sera I. is 33 and married with no children.

Susitina has three years of experience in this business.  Susitina needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.

He is 31 years old, single, and the group leader of a 12-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. Joel has had a motorcycle transportation service for over 8 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nJoel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joel is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in his business. This will be the first loan taken out by Joel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Litia now needs a loan to boost her business for increased profitability.\r\nLitia started her sari-sari store on her own initiative. She wants to continue her business, and is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP to use as additional capital to improve her business and income. Specifically, the money will be used to purchase five sacks of rice, charcoal, sugar, canned goods, cigarettes, fabric conditioner and other supplies for her store. \r\nLitia dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to other villages.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina Y.'s main source of income comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. She is 37 years old, married and has two school-age children. They are from the village of San Pedro. Josefina has been in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josefina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Josefina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase livestock to raise and sell. Josefina is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her seventh loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nJosefina is the leader of a seven member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Josefina Y.'s Group\".\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/i>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":527922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

E. is the president of the loan group Nyota. Dressed in the black dress, she is raising her hand in the photo. She is a client on her 16th loan cycle, 34 years old, married, and mother of three children, all of whom attend school. Her husband is a small trader of various products. Kahambu W. E. sells diverse products like suitcases, small chain jewelry, dresses, blouses, pants, women's boubous (traditional clothing), skirts, shoes, etc. in her small shop. Sometimes family friends buy her products.\r\nShe began her business with her own funds from her husband. Her initial capital was $100. This allowed her to launch a business selling rice. A short time afterward, in collaboration with her husband, her business evolved into a small boutique. She has now done this work for 13 years.\r\nWith a loan from IMF Hekima, Kahambu W. E. wishes to increase her sales by purchasing six suitcases, four female boubous, six blouses, six skirts, and ten Manzaza chains. Kahambu's biggest challenge is that she still rents (at home and at her workplace). Thus, all of her business profits go to pay her rent, estimated at $20 per month. Sometimes, her lessor insists that she guarantee nine months' payment.\r\nIn the future, Kahambu W. E. plans to grow her business and leave the communal bank for a united group which offers many operational advantages in terms of increased credit, interest tax, and repayment deadlines. Moreover, in the near future, Kahambu wishes to buy a plot of land and, god willing, a car. In ten years, she intends to open a second boutique in the center of Goma. She plans on getting supplies from the world's large commercial centers, either in Dubai or in China.\r\nKahambu thanks the IMF Hekima for the loans she received without any material guarantee because, thanks to these loans, she has already equipped her house, she manages to meet her children's needs, and her business is prospering. \r\nThe Nyota group is made up of 16 members, the majority of whom are female.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva

He is 37 years old, single with an eight-year-old child who is in the 4th grade. He also cares for two siblings. George is a high school graduate but could not continue his education through college due to poverty.\n\nFor almost two years he has been selling mobile phone recharge cards and exchanging local currency to United States Dollars at the Redlight market in Paynesville, Liberia. George started his business with about 14,000 Liberian Dollars and now has more goods and cash on hand. He sometimes faces problems with people bringing counterfeit currency to exchange. George sells recharge cards at a reasonable price and exchange currency at a low rate in order to keep customers returning.

She has been selling a variety of items for the past 12 years. Having started her working life with poultry-farming, Mrs. Dialla completely changed direction by taking up the sale of fabrics, sheets, chickens and sheep. She is planning on using this loan to buy sheets in Touba (a religious town which lies 180 kilometers from Dakar) and sheep in Kaolack, the town where she comes from. She will raise the sheep in order to prepare for an \"op\u00e9ration\" (a fair initiated by the government where sheep will be sold directly to consumers) held at Tabaski (a sacrificial festival which will be celebrated next November). This loan will allow her thus to develop and strengthen her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

D. aqu\u00ed se derivan  hermosos detalles y regalos dirigidos por j\u00f3venes, adultos, ni\u00f1os, hombres y mujeres, a  suegras, hermanas, cu\u00f1adas, amigas y vecinas. Esta es L. raz\u00f3n por L. cual Olga Katherine D. L. R., mujer D.  gran experiencia en mercadeo, se prepara, invirti\u00e9ndole al negocio una mercanc\u00eda ajustada a esta celebraci\u00f3n, para hacer su oferta en el mes D. Mayo; elL. tambi\u00e9n decora, con motivos que expresan el amor D. madre, su otro negocio donD. presta el servicio D. fotocopiado e impresi\u00f3n; as\u00ed lo ha hecho durante 4 a\u00f1os, en los que ha construido su mercado; hoy su clienteL. ha anticipado sus  pedidos D. vestidos, perfumes, carteras femeninas y necesita un cr\u00e9dito por valor D. $ 1.500.000 y   para poder responderle oportunamente est\u00e1  solicit\u00e1ndolo su 5\u00b0 financiamiento a L. Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Olga dice que los cr\u00e9ditos logrados en esta organizaci\u00f3n,  le han servido para solventar su econom\u00eda familiar, porque cuando elL. se inici\u00f3 como comerciante  en el a\u00f1o 2006, vend\u00eda solamente mercanc\u00eda y ten\u00eda pocos clientes, y generaba pocos ingresos para su familia;  ahora no solo son familiares y vecinos sus clientes  sino tambi\u00e9n referidos D. sus amigos y ha logrado mas utilidades, porque adem\u00e1s agreg\u00f3 otro negocio: el D. servicio D. fotocopiado e impresiones que le da L. oportunidad D. compartir su tiempo, entre las actividades productivas, reproductivas y dom\u00e9sticas. Ahora sue\u00f1a con tener su propia casa, sacar adelante L. educaci\u00f3n D. sus tres hijos en las edades D. 1 a 9 a\u00f1os, incrementar su negocio en ventas e infraestructura, y sobre todo continuar con su servicio D. calidad en L. atenci\u00f3n a su especial clienteL., porque Olga Katherine, vive en el popular barrio CiudadeL. 20 D. Julio, y su ubicaci\u00f3n L. aprovecha muy bien, teniendo en cuenta que en \u00e9l interact\u00faan residencias familiares, negocios estacionarios y ambulantes y est\u00e1 muy cerca al Estadio Metropolitano D. BarranquilL., escenario seD. del equipo D. futbol muy querido por los coste\u00f1os \u201cEl Junior\u201d      \n\n","en":"May is approaching, and with it the day that in Colombia commemorates mothers, created originally as \"a day of mothers for peace\", which later became a day for each family to honor its mother and has become a holiday in many parts of the world.  In this month of May sales are high because recognition is given not only to biological mothers, but to all women who mother, or who fill the role of mother.  Beautiful tokens and gifts are given by youths, adults, children, men and women, to mothers-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason Olga Katherine D. L. R., a woman experienced in marketing, prepares by stocking her business with merchandise tailored to this celebration, to sell in the month of May; she also decorates her other business, where she offers photocopy and printing services, with motifs expressing love for mothers.  She has done this for four years, the time in which she has run her business.  Now her customers have given her orders for dresses, perfumes, and purses, and she needs a loan for 1500 Colombian pesos to be able to fill these orders.  She is asking for her fifth loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nOlga says the loans she has received from this organization have helped her cover her household expenses, because when she began her life as a businesswoman in 2006, she only sold merchandise and had few customers, and earned little for her family.  Now her customers are not only relatives and neighbors but also people referred to her by their friends, and she has maD. more profit because she also added another business:  the photocopy and printing service that gives her the opportunity to diviD. her time among business and domestic activities.\r\n\r\nNow she dreams of having her own house, moving ahead with the education of her three children (ages one to nine years old), expanding her business' sales and infrastructure, and above all continuing with her quality service to her special customers, because Olga Katherine lives in the popular CiudadeL. 20 D. Julio neighborhood, and her location is very advantageous for her.  In the neighborhood there are family residences, shops and traveling businesses, and it is very near the Metropolitan Stadium of BarranquilL., the home field for the \"El Junior\" soccer team, which is very popular with the coastal residents.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She has one child who is now 25 years old. She started farming in 1989, and it has been the source of her income since. In 2005, she was introduced to Community Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI), an MFI in the Philippines. It was new to her, but she was interested in joining because she needed financial support for her farm. She said that she is happy she joined five years ago because the MFI\u2019s program has been very helpful in maintaining her farm. She is now applying for a loan of 50,000 PHP, which she will use to buy farm supplies like seeds and fertilizer. She will also buy other farming materials that she needs.\r\n\r\n\u201cAsenso Loans are a new product offered by CEVI for clients showing strong performance in previous loans, and who need a larger loan in order to continue to develop. CEVI recognizes the importance of helping people out of poverty, as well as providing continuous support and training as these clients progress. CEVI aims to provide financial services, not only to our poorest clients, but also to our developing clients who should be rewarded for the way in which they display promising business skills. Please help us provide support for these clients.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCEVI has increased its portfolio significantly over the past 5 years. Based in Bohol, they have 22 branches throughout the Philippines, and will soon be adding two more branches. CEVI has recently been awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. Social performance monitoring is imperative in order to measure a microfinance institute\u2019s effectiveness. The fact that CEVI is participating in this process speaks volumes. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but, additionally, savings, insurance, and training are provided through regular cluster group meetings.

The eight women members of this group live in Shiroles, Lim\u00f3n, located in the hot and humid Caribbean region of Costa Rica. This will be the group\u2019s first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nThe members are engaged in various productive activities. For example, some members are involved in animal rearing. These women will use this loan to invest in the purchase of livestock such as piglets or chicks as well as nutrients to feed them. The rearing and selling of livestock necessitates the construction of a house for the animals. As a result, this loan will also be used to make general investments in the construction of pens for animals. The women who are involved in pig rearing will need at least three months before they can butcher and, in turn, sell their pork products. \r\n\r\nOther group members are involved in clothing and catalogue sales. These women plan to use this loan to purchase clothing, cosmetics, kitchen items and various other products, which they will sell to members of their community.  Clothing items to be purchased include pants, blouses and children\u00b4s clothing. \r\n\r\nSome of the women are engaged in the harvest of plantains. For these members, this loan will be used to invest in the purchase of small plantain plants which will be planted for harvest. Due to the abundant amount of wildlife in Caribbean Costa Rica, in order to ensure the quality of plantains, it is necessary to protect them. For this reason, this loan will also be used to purchase protective bags that will be placed over plantains throughout their journey to maturity. \r\n\r\nIngrid M. A. is a 29-year-old mother who lives with her husband, daughter and nephew. Ingrid has a business selling perfumes: she collects orders in the Shiroles community and travels every 15 days to the closest big city (Lim\u00f3n) to make purchases.  This loan will be used by Ingrid to purchase perfumes that she will sell in her community. \r\n\r\nIngrid\u2019s main goals are to dedicate as much time as possible to selling perfumes and to provide financial support to her family. She hopes this loan will help her to increase her working capital and put her in a position to purchase more products for sale. She strives to be able to offer her family money when they need it. \r\n\r\nIngrid says that the members of this group have lived in the same region for their whole lives; for this reason, the members know each other well. Additionally, many of the group members are related.  She says that she likes the group lending model because it allows the members to assist each other when necessary.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":532692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","use":"For the purchase of perfumes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Shiroles, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingrid ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeisel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmeri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivannia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosal\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":191829.74},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":195026.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":198277.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":201581.97},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":204941.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":208342.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.99},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":398.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":405.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":380,"local_amount":192000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":192926,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712590,"comment":null},{"amount":386.1,"local_amount":195080.82,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":196021.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047949,"comment":null},{"amount":392.77,"local_amount":198451.35,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":199408.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763259,"comment":null},{"amount":399.31,"local_amount":201758.87,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":202731.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850744,"comment":null},{"amount":405.97,"local_amount":205121.52,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":206110.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258683,"comment":null},{"amount":410.85,"local_amount":207587.44,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":208588.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411555,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-01T21:55:07Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197470,"name":"Feyisetun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Feyisetun produces and sells bean flour.

Raquel has been selling shoes for more than a year and a half. Thus she travels every fifteen days to the city of Chiclayo, in the north of the country, a city that is well known for its good manufacture of leather clothing and other leather articles. In this way she supplies the necessary merchandise, in this case shoes, to be sold later at a better price in the place where she lives. This is how she is able to fill the requests of her customers who previously placed orders with her, and then she begins collecting the payments, which are made in two parts.

To do this, he will buy sand and cement to start the work.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wants to put walls around his bedroom and kitchen, which would make the family more comfortable.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":532727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of sand and cement to tile the living room of his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T01:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.87,"local_amount":417.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":446.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151822045,"comment":null},{"amount":20.35,"local_amount":406.98,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":435.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562057,"comment":null},{"amount":19.9,"local_amount":397.97,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":425.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770967,"comment":null},{"amount":20.28,"local_amount":405.57,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":433.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204858,"comment":null},{"amount":19.66,"local_amount":393.24,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":420.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330553,"comment":null},{"amount":19.23,"local_amount":384.56,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":411.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465710,"comment":null},{"amount":19.71,"local_amount":394.22,"processed_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":421.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097852,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":855.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766138,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":427.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209230,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T17:16:05Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197490,"name":"C2718 Dutsindubukene Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Damscene is 32 years old and is married with three children who are 2, 3 and 6 years old.

She has a dream to build her store with other materials that will give her business stability.\r\n\r\nAna has a small clothes store in the market, and with the small earnings she can support her 2 children.  She wants to invest more in her business and thus improve her earnings.  With much effort and thinking about family improvement, Josefina opened a small store and bookstore in the market.

More than two years ago, she began selling food from a stall she operates within one of the most popular markets of her area. Rogelia is very happy with her work, since she likes to cook; in addition, this activity keeps her busy all day, especially in the mornings, when the highest numbers of customers come to buy her food. At the end of the day, she takes care of the housework. Throughout this time, she has learned to persevere until she reaches her goals. In this spirit, she wants to expand her food stall and offer better service to her customers by providing more tables and chairs. This is her third loan with MFP, and she has always been very punctual with all of her payments. With the loan she is currently requesting, she will buy products such as rice, sugar, noodles and condiments which are necessary to prepare the dishes she sells. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":532801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Buying basic ingredients to prepare the food she sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90.52},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94.92},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":99.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":110.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":113.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":116.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.7},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.7},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.58,"local_amount":75.94,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":76.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934492,"comment":null},{"amount":31.68,"local_amount":90.52,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673265,"comment":null},{"amount":31.71,"local_amount":90.61,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":91.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887092,"comment":null},{"amount":260.03,"local_amount":742.93,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":746.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886385,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-03T20:35:44Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
