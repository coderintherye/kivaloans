She works out of her home along with her husband, who is helping her with the loan which she requests.  \r\n\r\nFor ten years they have worked in the business of bricks, and the loan which they request is to invest in their familiar trade of making bricks.

They have 3 workers, who are paid an amount that corresponds to the amount of bricks they sell.  They sell their bricks in Portoviejo, and make contracts with construction companies, requiring them to produce 10,000 bricks per month.  They charge 80 dollars per thousand bricks, and when it does not rain, their sales go down, since there is less water to use for producing bricks.  They sell all the bricks that they are able to bake.  Se\u00f1ora Norma is the one in charge of preparing food for the workers who produce the bricks for their business.  Everyone tries to begin working by 4 a.m., because at that hour they can work in the open air without having to protect themselves from the harsh mid-day sun.  It is difficult work, requiring the sacrifice of comfort, and they have worked hard at it for 10 years.

are 10, 15, and 18 years old.  They live in the Kuluyo community in the Sacaba province of the city of Cochabamba.  He has worked in agriculture for the past 20 years; he works with his wife growing crops like potatoes, peas, and beans.\r\n\r\nBenedicto is a hard-working person who has had a difficult life since he was a child; he was the oldest of 5 children and he had to take care of his family after the death of his father.  His father worked in construction and passed away when a building fell on top of him; Benedicto's mother became an alcoholic after being widowed with her 4 children.  Benedicto started to work and he left school to help his siblings; he couldn't work in the fields and study at the same time because the school only ran in the mornings.\r\n\r\nBenedicto is seeking a loan to buy seeds as planting season for potatoes and vegetables is approaching; he needs to buy seeds and fertilizer which will help his crops and improve his income.  His wife works making cheese which she sells in the town.  They both work hard so that their children can have a better life, finish school and hopefully find better work in the future.  Benedicto dreams of helping his young daughter to study to become a teacher who can help teach the children of alcoholic parents--just as he used to be.  In this way, these kids won't have to stop studying and will have a better future.  He is very proud of his family and of his wife because she is always supporting him; taking care of his family is the most important thing in his life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":532851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds and organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211200976,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-08T19:42:46Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197559,"name":"Cristo La Fuente Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Disiana, 63, is the coordinator of her group Cristo La Fuente (Christ is the Source), and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) generally.

The eight women members live in Aguas Fr\u00edas, Lim\u00f3n, located in the hot and humid Caribbean region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are involved in various income-generating activities including sewing, animal rearing (chickens, cows and pigs) as well as the harvesting of plantains, rice and watermelons. This loan will be used generally by the members to invest in the growth of their individual productive activities. The women involved in animal rearing plan to use this loan to purchase livestock and animal feed.\r\n\r\nThe women of this group are able to contribute significantly to their family incomes as a result of the earnings generated from their productive activities. This income is supplemented by salaries earned by the men in their families who work as laborers in the pineapple and banana fields of Aguas Fr\u00edas.\r\n\r\nThe women have expressed great concern for the environmental devastation to the community river and health problems that their husbands and sons have developed as a result of working for the employer who owns the land. Respiratory problems, infertility and skin ailments are listed by the women of this group as common side effects of men laboring in the fields. The women attribute these negative effects to the fact that the employer provides faulty equipment, and the men are required to work with heavy, toxic chemicals in places with little or no shade. For the residents of this community, there are few employment opportunities. This daily reality describes the struggle that these women must cope with.\r\n\r\nEdel S. F. has a sewing business and an agricultural business. She will use this loan primarily to invest in her agriculture business by purchasing watermelon, rice and squash seeds as well as agricultural nutrients. The loan will also be used to invest in the purchase of materials for making clothes which will enable her to produce more sewing products. Edel says she operates on a per order basis, her clients request a certain type of product whether it be men\u2019s, women\u2019s, or children\u2019s clothing and she produces it within a given period.\r\n\r\nEdel\u2019s goals are to produce more, both agriculturally and in her sewing activity. She hopes to expand both businesses and increase her income. She says her main obstacle is access to working capital and this loan will help to address this challenge. Another obstacle for Edel is the fact that her sewing machine is very old and doesn\u2019t work very well. It breaks down often, at which times she must hire a mechanic to come and repair it.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group have known each other for over ten years. They say that they prefer the group lending model to the individual lending model because, as a group, they can support each other and learn from one another.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":532872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase watermelon, rice and squash seeds as well as more materials for making clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Aguas Fr\u00edas, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marixa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2375,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1205787.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411556,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-01T01:38:31Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197569,"name":"Eddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eddy is an individual loan client with Esperanza and his story is representative of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) generally.

Marina has a little grocery store that she started after her first daughter was born and she needed to start the business.  When her husband left them alone, she had to take care of her daughters and didn't want to be away from them, so she thought that a little store would allow her to take care of them and support them at the same time.  Right now she has competition, but that does not sadden her, since she has the good luck of having the first grocery business in the area, and the good luck that everyone knows her. \r\n\r\nWith this loan,  Marina is planning on diverifying her business more since the competition is hard in her area.  She won't give up; the advantage is that her business is in the center of the community and this is helping her a lot. By increasing her income, she has the opportunity for her daughters to continue their studies. Since she was never able to do this, she wants to give them the best and for them to be do better in the future than she did, professionally speaking.  \r\n\r\nMarina is happy with the \u201c Ahuehuete \u201c group, since she trusts the other members who are very reponsible people.

They are located in an area called the Community, in Jilotepec, in the state of Mexico in Mexico.  The group is made up of 11 members.\r\n<p>\r\nMelquiades Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez is a member of the group. She is 50 years old, has three years of schooling, is a merchant, and has a total of 7 children (2 girls and 5 boys).   Her business is raising sheep which she has been doing for 30 years.  She started the business shortly after she was married with just one young sheep, which grew, and late she bought an ewe, and from there she grew the business. She picked a pair to continue breeding and the rest she sold with a horse and a burro that she had to buy dishes and crockery for her home. With the pair of lambs that kept she kept breeding more sheep and now she is asking for a loan to buy food and fodder to feed them. This will also allow her to buy more sheep and expand her business to earn more money and continue supporting her husband's efforts to construct a house for them to provide a better life for their family. She considers the loan a great opportunity.\r\n<p?\r\nIsabel L. D. is the treasurer of the group.  She is 28 years old, went to school until the third year of high school, is married, and has two children (a girl and a boy).  She has been raising pigs for the last 5 years.  She is asking for a loan to buy food to fatten up the pigs that she has so that once they are ready to be sold she can buy more and little by little expand her business and income.  This way she has the possibility to help out with the household expenses and provide her children a healthier diet. She hopes that she will one day have more pigs and a greater income so that one day she will be able to finish her kitchen and a bedroom for her children\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n- Esperanza Zu\u00f1iga Hijinio (Sells groceries)\r\n- Cindia A.

Teresita R.\u2019s status in life is not as high as her dreams for herself and her family. Nevertheless, the wall of poverty that hinders her way to achieving her aspirations is not as tall nor as wide as her vision of seeing a great life behind it. The love and support of her husband and four children (whose age range is from 19 to 27 years old) create her ladder for crossing over from the border of poverty to a higher standard of living.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Teresita joined ASHI for financial support for achieving her goals in life. Loans she received then gave her an opportunity to have her own small variety store business. This career, aside from being a wife and a mother, lifted her self confidence and has improved her sense of well being. She deals with many customers from around their village everyday, as well as attending to the needs of her family. \r\n\r\nProceeds from her business enable her to augment her husband\u2019s small income from being a driver, and have been a great source of cash flow for her family. All of Teresita\u2019s children are laborers and have no stable job due to their low educational attainment. This situation worries her as a mother, so she wants her own business to grow and be stable through the support of the loan she is presently requesting through ASHI. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that her small variety store will grow into a huge grocery store, and that she will be able to employ her children to work with her. By then, their standard of living will have improved.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":533006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

He is the leader of a five-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<br>Roger is 38 years old, married, and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Roger owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Roger has been engaged in his business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Roger joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be his fifth from ASKI. Roger plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay his children's tuition fees. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":532597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional inventory and as working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Casalatan, Cauayan City, Isabela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-05-31T07:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roger","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Glenda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sedocia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1459},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1443}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":366.83,"local_amount":16049,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":16384.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151831530,"comment":null},{"amount":166.75,"local_amount":7295,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7447.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159571081,"comment":null},{"amount":133.39,"local_amount":5836,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5958.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166779615,"comment":null},{"amount":133.03,"local_amount":5820,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5941.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172047821,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-22T03:24:12Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:29:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197629,"name":"Lubele South Abanyo Nighty Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community.

She is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be her sixth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

A. is from the village of Orang Cabgan, Tambulig, Zamboanga Del Sur.

The main source of income for the business comes from raising fish for sale in her fishpond. Zucima has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2008, Zucima joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Zucima is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be her seventh from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

R. is 44 years old and is married to Eddie R.. The couple has two children, both of whom are college students. She and her husband have worked hard but they had a very small income, and they didn't have enough capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nIn 1997, Nancy heard about the Kiva field partner, ASHI, and began dreaming of having a stable life, a stable home and of starting a business. When she received her first and succeeding loans from ASHI, Nancy started her own business of selling fish in the local community. She has had this business for many years. Fish selling has been a great help to her family. As a busy entrepreneur, Nancy also embarked on a tricycle transport business (motorcycle with sidecar). Her husband, Eddie, manages this business.\r\n\r\nHowever, the demands of her family grow as years go by. She wants to have more businesses that can add to her present income so she will have bigger profits and savings. She had the idea of operating a sari-sari (variety) store. It has been great! Nancy is earning a good income and she wants to make a larger investment in it. On her 11th loan, she is proposing a new loan amounting 45,000 PHP to expand her growing variety store business.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of business, Nancy can still manage her previous business of fish selling, because either her children or her husband can operate their sari-sari (variety) store at home when she's away selling fish. Someday, as her income increases, she dreams of funding her children\u2019s education until they complete college degrees and have professional jobs. Her greatest dreams are to get out from the downward spiral of poverty and to have a happy life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":984,"image":{"id":533131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand her variety store by purchasing more groceries.

A., 30, is married and the mother of two children. She and her family live together in a ger (the Mongolian nomadic tent) in Bayn-Ulgii province. Her son, Jolaman, is a first grade student in a local primary school. Her 6-year-old daughter, Janerke, attends kindergarten. Marina operates a raw material trading business at a local market called Ah-Dam. She has been operating her business since 1999, and has steadily expanded it over the past 11 years. She collects sheep skins as well as sheep intestines and earns a profit of 300 MNT for each sheep skin and set of sheep intestines. In addition, she purchases cashmere for 44,000 MNT and sells it for 44,300 MNT. Her monthly profit is 300,000 MNT.  \n\nMarina has been in this business for many years and has gained significant experience as a raw material trader. Furthermore, she has particular places where she collects leather and sheep skins. Her husband operates a mobile raw material trading business, the same as his wife's, but in another market called Tirlik. Generally, Marina's family's standard of living is good. She is an enthusiastic person and focused on the future. She says, \u201cThe raw material trading business is not easy work to do because working conditions are not that good. However, since I started this business, my family's quality of life has been noticeably improving.\u201d She is requesting a 1,000,000 MNT loan to purchase sheep skins and intestines for her business.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 10.1.2 Nam Ng\u1ea1n Group.\n\nQu\u1ebf is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Qu\u1ebf owns and operates a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling herbs and spices in the local community. Qu\u1ebf has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Qu\u1ebf joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan of 1.963.500 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women which was successfully repaid, her new loan of 4.248.000 VND will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan that Qu\u1ebf has taken out from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business.\n\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\n\n1.  \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb L\u1eeda (6) is a 65-year-old female who is requesting a 4.248.000 VND loan to support her business making and selling food.\n\n2.

Awaou has been living with her children and her husband in PK10, in the S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji commune, for about ten years. The couple shares the family\u2019s financial responsibility. Awaou did not attend school. In order to meet her needs and those of her family, Awaou has been selling laundry detergent and soaps at home and elsewhere for about seventeen years.

In a month, he makes profits to the tune of 200,000 Ugandan shillings.\r\n\r\nFrancis\u2019s future plans are to fully expand his transactions which will earn him more revenue to pay for his children\u2019s education requirements. With this loan, he anticipates making great strides in achieving this dream.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":533284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To restock the animals on his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Penina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constance","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clemensia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1800000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":307878.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767377,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":307878.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662395,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":307878.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689165,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":307878.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903336,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":307878.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296877,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":307878.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467209,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-04T06:58:02Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197722,"name":"Sope Dabakh Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"SOPE DABAKH est un groupement de 5 femmes commer\u00e7antes.

(She is the one in the photo with her hand raised and her loan contract in hand, in the background).  She is a 4th loan cycle client, aged 46, widowed, and the mother of two daughters, both of whom have their own homes already.  The daughters are appropriately pursuing their education with the support of their husbands.  \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga's husband died in 1994 due to his family's ignorance and carelessness. Bubenga says that, instead of going to get care at a regular hospital, her husband's family had favored taking her now deceased husband to a <i>f\u00e9ticheur marabout<\/i> (traditional practitioner), which complicated his health situation, leading to an early death. \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga sells vegetables:  <i>sombe<\/i> (cassava leaves), spinach, amaranth, tomatoes, eggplant, etc.  She displays her produce at the small market of the Mapendo-Birere district and sometimes in front of warehouses or outlets.  \r\n\r\nShe started her small business with her own funds.  Her initial capital was $70.  Then, she was informed about the micro-finance institution Hekima, which lends to the poor without collateral.  From that, she got her first boost loan.  With the loan from the MFI Hekima, she would like to increase her sales by buying vegetables she will be able to resell.  \r\n\r\nThe big challenge she faces is variability; that is, there is a big difference in prices, such that, during the rainy season, prices plunge, given that vegetables are plentiful on the market.  During droughts, there is a shortage of vegetables.  Despite this, consumers (customers, people) will still buy, and Bubenga will derive as much profit as she can.  \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga came to the decision to watch over her biological mother (her daughters' grandmother), who is now very old.  She remains at her side to attend to her and to care for more struggling orphans in her extended family.  As much as her sales are increasing, she would prefer switching her work to supplying <i>pagnes<\/i> (clothing of Congolese women) in the city of Bukavu, the capital of the province of Sud Kivu.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, Bubenga would like to build a house in the future on her parcel of land located in the outer district of Goma City, in Ndosho (Kiziba II), and then rent it out.  This would bring in money.  \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga thanks the MFI Hekima for the loans she receives with no collateral at all.  Because of these loans, she is managing to provide for her family, and her business is really prospering.  She says, \"May God bless the MFI Hekima.\"  \r\n\r\nThis group, Umoja ni Nguvu, is composed of fifteen members, mostly women.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":533352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Vegetables (tomatoes, cassava leaves, spinach, peppers) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo","town":"Goma, North Kivu province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":160,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bubenga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Murhula ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maomboleo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kahindo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lulizema","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chishugi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muhambikwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wabenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mangaza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tulinabo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukakarisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Furaha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sharya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Riziki ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2190,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":422.19,"local_amount":420.27,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":422.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732121,"comment":null},{"amount":699.85,"local_amount":696.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":699.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151915729,"comment":null},{"amount":399.65,"local_amount":397.83,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":399.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159656111,"comment":null},{"amount":678.31,"local_amount":675.23,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":678.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166870538,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-02T17:55:15Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:27:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197778,"name":"Biola","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Biola sells electronics at retail prices to his customers.

without any collateral, through loan groups.\u00a0 From that, she is benefiting from her first reinforcement loan.\r\n\r\nWith the loan from MFI Hekima, Tabu wishes to increase her sales by buying:\u00a0 a sack of beans, 25 kilos of rice, two cases of Fanta soda, two containers of Rina vegetable oil, 20 kilos of potatoes, three bunches of bananas, 10 kilos of meat, some fish, vegetables, etc.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe big challenge of hers is that people do not buy when there is no money in circulation.\u00a0 Despite all this, she is deriving as much profit as she can, since food is the priority of all priorities of anyone.\u00a0 She is comfortable with her business.\r\n\r\nIn her plans, she wishes to build a house on her former parcel of land where the flow of lava of the erupting Nyiragongo volcano crossed.\u00a0 In addition, she is determined to cover the costs of her children's schooling on a regular basis.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nTabu thanks the MFI Hekima for the repeated loans she receives without any collateral at all because, given these loans, she says she is managing to provide for her family.\r\n\r\nThe group Adhadi is composed of seventeen members, most of whom are women.\u00a0<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

R\u00edos province and, at 15 years of age, she relocated to the Picoaza district.  She works each and every day to get ahead in her business since, for her, it is very gratifying to live in a county as beautiful as San Vicente.  However, she knows everything isn\u2019t fantasy and that it\u2019s a scientific fact that she has to work hard to help her children get ahead. They are young, and still need the strength and support of their parents.  She sells shoes and her husband sells pans and knives in other areas of the country.  Carmen buys shoes for the business and sells them on credit.  Somehow, this way of working generates income.  She travels door to door to visit customers, and charges on a weekly basis.  Her shoes start at $10; she has been working only a few months.\r\n\r\nCarmen has been married for 5 years and, given how young her children still are, it has often been difficult to carry out her work.  However, her mother has been a great help by caring for the kids while she works.  They live with her in-laws, and she hopes to have her own house one day.  She hopes to use part of the loan to buy merchandise, and share the other part with her husband.  She buys different styles of shoes, which her sister helps her choose from the merchandise available.  \r\n\r\nCarmen buys three-dozen pairs of shoes each month, which the distributor delivers directly to her home.

En dehors de ses enfants l\u00e9gitimes, elle h\u00e9berge \u00e9galement  4 autres enfants de sa famille \u00e9largie (cousin, neuve, voisin du village).   \nBaseme B. Apoline vend des  boissons (bi\u00e8re Primus, Mutzing et sucr\u00e9s Fanta, etc.).

Apoline souhaite augmenter son chiffre d\u2019affaire en achetant des 36 caisses de sucr\u00e9s Fanta.\nLe grand d\u00e9fi de Baseme B. Apoline est que les gens consomment parfois \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit avec risque de lui payer avec retard. Et d\u2019autres ach\u00e8tent mais ne lui restituent pas les bouteilles vides. Malgr\u00e9 tout cela Baseme B. Apoline y tire son maximum de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, elle est confortable avec son business.\nBaseme B.

Apoline is president of the loan group Umoja Kibabi. In the white blouse, raising her hand in the photo, she is a client on her 14th loan cycle; she is 36 years old, married and the mother of five children, all studying well. Her husband is unemployed. In addition to her own children, four other children are also living with her from her extended family (cousin, nephew, neighbor in the village).\r\n\r\nBaseme B. Apoline sells drinks (Primus and Mutzig beer, Fanta sodas, etc.). She displays her products in front of friends' and acquaintances' shops (on the street, the Signers roundabout) and sells wholesale; she occasionally sells retail from her home. She began her small business with her own money, which she received from her father-in-law as a gift. Her initial capital investment was twenty dollars, which is equivalent to two cases of Primus beer. She has been in business for sixteen years. With the loan from the microfinance institution Hekima, Baseme B. Apoline would like to increase her sales by buying 36 cases of Fanta.\r\n\r\nBaseme B. Apoline's greatest challenge is that people sometimes drink on credit, with the risk of paying her back late. Others buy, but do not return the empty bottles. Despite all this, Baseme B. Apoline makes her maximum profit; she is comfortable with her business.\r\n\r\nBaseme B. Apoline thanks the microfinance institution Hekima for the permanent loans which she is receiving with no material collateral. Thanks to these loans, she is able to meet her family's needs, she says.\r\n\r\nThe Umoja Kibabi group is comprised of twenty members, the majority of which are women.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

By offering innovative products such as technical education loans and microfinance groups for young persons, EDAPROSPO helps disadvantaged Peruvians lift themselves out of poverty.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emanuela Villa, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":533428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy products and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaycan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.083333 -76.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Noemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9800,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":856.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1712.5,"local_amount":4900,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4918.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877164,"comment":null},{"amount":856.25,"local_amount":2450,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2459.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617136,"comment":null},{"amount":856.25,"local_amount":2450,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2459.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831471,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-27T10:39:49Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197825,"name":"Nilani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nilani is a 40-year-old married woman living with her husband.

The area enjoys a temperate climate, facilitating production of some fruits and vegetables.  Topographically, it is a city exposed to the sun from its culminating eastern point, the Santuario Franciscano church and temple, and descending in great inclines until the canyon of the Burgay River.\r\n\r\nMariana is 29 years old, married, and has conceived 5 children from the union.  Their ages are 13, 11, 5, 3, and 1. Her eldest 3 children study in a regional school, and thanks to her husband, who works in construction and also paints houses, they have gotten ahead.  The house they live in is rented and their major dream is to have their own home.\r\n\r\nMariana used to sell grains and vegetables but things went badly due to a drought that hit the region, causing prices to shoot up. As a result, sales fell badly.  Now, she will dedicate her efforts to selling salchipapas (a sausage and potatoes dish) from her aunt's house.\r\n\r\nMariana has been with her communal bank through 5 loan cycles.  She was invited to join this team of enterprising women by her mother. With this requested loan she will buy everything necessary to begin her business of selling fast foods, including sausages, potatoes, salsas and bags.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":532903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"BUYING SAUSAGES, POTATOES, SALSA, SNACKS, AND BAGS TO START A FAST FOOD BUSINESS","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-05T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mariana De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":224.99,"local_amount":219.99,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":224.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709115,"comment":null},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892413,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632775,"comment":null},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846809,"comment":null},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113312,"comment":null},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":73.37,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406876,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T17:15:15Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":197838,"name":"Martha Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Martha M. es socia del banco  Esperanza del Ma\u00f1ana, vive en la urbe de la ciudad de Azogues en el sector  Peleus\u00ed de Azogues, esta localidad cuenta con un clima templado favoreciendo el cultivo de algunas frutas tropicales, tambi\u00e9n es una regi\u00f3n bastante  asoleada desde el punto Este  hasta el  templo del Santuario Franciscano, la topograf\u00eda desciende con grandes inclinaciones hasta el caj\u00f3n del r\u00edo Burgay.\n\nMartha  tiene 42 a\u00f1os, casada y con cuatro hijos que tienen 20, 16, 14, 10 a\u00f1os, los cuales estudian en instituciones educativas de la localidad,  su esposo es polic\u00eda y ella  vende  frutas en su puesto  propio en el mercado hace 30 a\u00f1os desde  las 10 a.m. hasta las 6 p.m. de domingo a  domingo.

Dice que cuando es tiempo de cosecha se trabaja mas duro para recoger toda la producci\u00f3n, pero como es una labor conjunta con los miembros de su familia se hace en menos tiempo.

The rest are grown and living independently. From a young age, Apolonio learned from his parents and his siblings the farming techniques necessary to obtain a successful harvest. Today he is a successful farmer who grows high-quality potatoes. Both his wife and his youngest son help him in this work, in order for his fields to be productive.  \r\n\r\nApolonio is always watching over his fields, caring for them as necessary with fertilizers so that they yield a good harvest. He enjoys his work because he knows how to get a good harvest. Although it can be tedious, it is satisfying to him because he enjoys this rural way of life. At harvest time, Apolonio and his family must work twice as hard, because it takes a great deal of effort to harvest all the potatoes.

The official name of this borrowing group is Artemio N.'s Group.\r\n\r\nArtemio is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Artemio owns & operates a specialized retail store selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community.

Artemio has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Artemio is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Artemio from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Despite the limited opportunities she and her family have, which hampers them from rising above poverty, Nenita still feels blessed because of the love and support of her husband in all her endeavors, especially in business.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 Nenita and her husband agreed to request for a loan through ASHI to be able to put up a business for her husband to manage. Through its revenue, her family would have a source of cash flow to support their daily needs.\r\n\r\nNenita was able to purchase two motorcycles for a transportation business. One is a tricycle with a sidecar attached and is operated by her husband, and the other one is rented by someone in their village. Because this is one of the common means of transportation for people in the whole of the town, since jeepneys (small buses) and buses are rare and are not accessible in remote villages, Nenita\u2019s business has grown fairly well.\r\n\r\nNow, as a matter of fact, Nenita has able to start up her own small sari-sari (variety) store business using the profits from her prior business.\r\n\r\nWhile Nenita\u2019s children are still young, she wants to grow her own business through the loan she is now requesting. This loan will be used to increase the inventory of her store such as foodstuffs, beverages, and other basic commodities for people in their neighborhood to access rather than having to spend money on fares to go to market. \r\n\r\nNenita is hoping to be able to put up a savings fund for the sustainability of her businesses as well as for the education of her children in the future. She is looking forward to the day when she would be marching on stage together with her children for them to receive their medal and diploma for their graduation from college.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":637,"image":{"id":533633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

has inspired Loda to continue her studies in college until she graduates and earns her degree. She is 26 years of age now and married to a 40-year-old security guard at one of the offices in town. Loda\u2019s marriage union has blessed her with two sweet and loving children, ages three and seven years old. Though Loda\u2019s husband supports her and her children financially, the woman still wants to be productive in her own way to support her own education and the needs of her children. Her husband\u2019s income is yet too small to support things her family needs to be able to experience life beyond poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen Loda joined ASHI in 2003, she requested a loan to start a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store, selling inventories of foodstuffs, beverages and other basic commodities for people in their village to purchase conveniently. Frequently her business can't be sustained and she has had to periodically shut it down. The loans she has received have been a great help in restoring her business. Despite those circumstances, Loda makes sure that she maintains an excellent repayment record with ASHI and attends the weekly ASHI center meetings. Assisted by her husband in fulfilling her responsibilities to ASHI,  Loda is now requesting a loan to improve her business and to fully achieve her dream of making it sustainable and profitable to be able to support her needs in her studies as well as the needs of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":533654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

Nangalisan, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is the leader of a five-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<br>Connie is 32 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, planting and harvesting rice for sale. Connie has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 40,000 PHP per harvest.\r\n<br>In 2008, Connie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 26,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Connie is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be her fifth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Fe D. lives in the first Barangay (village) of the province of Antique along with her 56-year-old husband and six children who range in age from 15 to 24 years old. Despite being poor, Fe and her family have been able to enjoy their lives by maximizing the resources of their community. Her husband and her 23-year-old son are fishermen and have been earning money through fishing. Fe sells the fish they catch in their neighborhood. Someday Fe wishes that her husband and child would be able to go fishing more often and catch more fish by having their own fishing motorboat. Through this, Fe would be able to sell more fish in the market and in their neighborhood for bigger revenue. Aside from that, she also wants to have her own small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store where she sells a few varieties of foodstuffs, beverages and other basic commodities. To be able to do this, Fe is requesting a much larger loan through ASHI. Proceeds of her business will be used to support the education of her two children who are still in school and augment an improved the life for her family.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ederlina is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand the business. This loan will be her seventh from ASKI.

He joined a group in Faulu Kenya called Forty in One to easily access financial support.  This is because when a member takes a loan he is guaranteed by the group members.  He wants to buy more clothes and shoes for sale. Hence, he has requested a loan of Kes. 80,000 from Faulu Kenya.  He believes that this loan will help him meet the needs of his different customers.

Thon C. is 43 years old.

Her husband, Mr. Mean Ngoung, is a rice mill laborer who receives a small income to support his family. Even with both businesses, they still don't earn enough income to support the family.

The official name of this borrowing group is Yolanda D.'s group.\r\nYolanda is 41 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\nIn 2009, Yolanda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Yolanda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from ASKI.

Common, Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya. She is the leader of a seven-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<br>Lourdes is 57 years old, married, and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Lourdes has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Lourdes joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lourdes is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand the business. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A customer on her fourth loan, she is 33 years old and married. She is mother to seven children, of whom five go to school, the other two being still small children. Her husband is unemployed. Mapendo sells charcoal. She began this business with her own capital, given to her by her husband when he was working in a private individual's hardware store. Her initial capital was $50. She sells the charcoal at a public market in the Alanine area of the urban municipality of Goma, eight kilometers from the centre of town. Mapendo has been carrying out this charcoal business for five years. She gets her supplies in the village of Kichanga, in the Masisi territory, which is the domain of General Nkunda, the ex-leader of the rebel movement CNDP, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The problem for Mapendo is that she does not yet have the means to fill a full lorry by herself,  so she is obliged to get together with another businesswoman in order to share the transactional costs and the expense of renting a vehicle to transport the goods. For the future her ambition is to grow her business, reach a capital of $1,500, and finally realise her dreams, notably of opening a large warehouse for charcoal and a hardware store. Furthermore, the main concern for Mapendo is for her husband to find work. \r\n\r\nMapendo is grateful to IMF Hekima for the regular loans she receives without having to provide any material guarantee. Thanks to these loans she is able to provide for the multiple needs of her family, above all during this period when her husband is out of work.\r\n\r\nThe B\u00e9n\u00e9diction group is made up of 13 members, all of whom are women. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

Not having attended much formal schooling, very early on he began business ventures, notably the sale of grains, which he learned from his uncle.

They are now seeking their second group loan. Previous loans were repaid without problems.

She sells her production at the Selingu\u00e9 market, for cash or on credit, to a clientele comprising mostly women. These women intend to turn a monthly profit of XOF 40'000 (ca US$ 80), to be reinvested in their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

A. is thirty-six years old and married to Isaac Bundotich, who is a forty-two-year-old policeman. They live in Kapkokwon and have four children, who are between five and fourteen years old. \r\n\r\nTeresa is a charcoal dealer; she started this business two years ago. This business has been earning her a monthly profit of 8,000 Kenyan shillings (KES), along with 5,000 KES from other sources. She does her business in Kabarnet Town next to Kobil Petrol Station. Her customers are residents of Kabarnet Town.\r\n\r\nTeresa has no previous credit history. She was introduced to KADET by an already existing customer.

Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nThis borrower from Lebanon is a 31-year-old married man with one child who is attending school. The borrower is the main income provider for his family.\r\n\r\nHe has ten years of experience working as a farmer. He uses plastic tents to improve the quality of his agriculturA. products. These tents also allow him to grow his products for more months during the year.
